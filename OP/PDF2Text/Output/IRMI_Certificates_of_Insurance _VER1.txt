In
Act
5,
Scene
5
of
Shakespeare’s
Macbeth
,
the
protagonist
offers
his
pessimistic
view
of
life
when
he 
says,
“It
is
a
tale,
told
by
an
idiot,
full
of
sound
and
fury,
signifying
nothing.”
Some
certificate
of 
insurance
(COI)
requestors
may
view
Association
for
Cooperative

and

(ACORD)

COIs
in
the
same
way. 
In
Bradley
Real
Estate
Trust
v.
Plummer
&
Rowe
Ins.
Agency,
Inc.
,
2
the
court
opined
that,
“In
effect,
the 
certificate
is
a
worthless
document….” 
But
is
a
COI,
specifically
an
ACORD
certificate
or
evidence
of
insurance
form,
truly
a
worthless 
document
that
signifies
nothing? 
That
is
the
principal
question
this
course
seeks
to
answer. 
Many
of
the
business
relationships
into
which
parties
enter
involve
risky
activities
where
it
is
critical
that 
the
risk
be
shifted
or
shared,
and
that
is
often
best
effected
by
what
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
“belt
and 
suspenders”
risk
management
approach
involving
insurance
and
contractual
risk
transfer. 
COIs
historically
have
been
the
means
most
often
used
to
provide
proof
of
insurance
under
construction 
and
service
contracts,
loan
documents,
leases,
and
other
business
situations.
These
certification 
documents
have
benefits,
but,
due
to
the
limited
information
they
contain,
they
also
have
deficiencies. 
Since
most
COIs
are
requested
to
confirm
the
existence
of
insurance
required
under
various
types
of 
contracts,
it
is
also
important
to
gain
a
fundamental
understanding
of
the
basics
of
contractual
risk 
transfer.
In
doing
so,
we
must
distinguish
between
indemnification
and
insurance
and
understand
why 
risk
is
often
transferred
“downstream.” 
Because
the
issuance
of
COIs
is,
in
itself,
a
risky
endeavor,
the
vast
majority
of
states
now
have
specific 
laws,
regulations,
or
regulatory
directives
governing
COIs.
Litigation
involving
certificates
is
quite 
extensive,
so
loss
control
for
this
activity
requires
an
examination
of
the
nature
of
errors
and
omissions 
claims
and
lawsuits,
along
with
a
number
of
business
issues
associated
with
the
costs
of
this
risk. 
While
there
are
many
types
of
insurance
certifications,
this
course
focuses
primarily
on
the
use
of 
industry-standard
forms
promulgated
by
ACORD
and
specifically
on
the
evolution
of
and
issues 
involving
the
ACORD
25—Certificate
of
Liability
Insurance
form.
In
addition,
several
other
issues 
related
to
COIs,
especially
in
the
construction
industry,
will
be
explored. 
With
that
introduction
behind
us,
let’s
review
the
course
objectives
and
then
answer
the
questions
what
is 
a
COI
and
what
isn’t
a
COI? 
1Course
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
course,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
the
role
of
COIs
in
contractual
risk
transfer;
•
recognize
the
potential
repercussions
of
failing
to
issue
COIs
that
meet
contractual
requirements;
•
identify
ways
to
balance
legal
and
business
constraints
in
certifying
insurance
coverage;
•
identify
milestones
in
the
history
and
evolution
of
COIs;
•
recognize
the
importance
of
disclaimers
found
in
ACORD
certificate
forms;
•
recognize
the
issues
involved
in
completing
ACORD
certificate
forms,
specifically
the
ACORD 
25;
•
identify
agency
procedures
and
quality
control
programs
that
reduce
the
professional
liability
of 
certificate
providers
while
reasonably
meeting
the
needs
of
certificate
requestors.
The
purpose
of
this
course
is
to
provide
an
in-depth
examination
of
the
purpose,
value,
and
caveats
of 
COIs.
The
course
begins
with
a
discussion
of
the
need
for
proof
of
insurance
that
arises
from
contracts 
into
which
businesses
enter
and
continues
with
a
brief
discussion
of
legal
and
business
issues
surrounding 
COIs.
An
overview
of
the
history
and
types
of
certificates
is
included.
The
primary
focus
of
this
course
is 
on
ACORD
certificates
and
evidences
of
insurance
that
dominate
the
marketplace,
especially
the
ACORD 
25—Certificate
of
Liability
Insurance.
A
history
of
the
important
changes
in
the
ACORD
25
is
included 
for
perspective,
followed
by
an
in-depth
review
of
issues
that
often
arise
from
contracts,
insurance 
certification
requests,
and
the
issuance
of
certificates.

Overview
Before
we
dig
into
specific
certificate
of
insurance
(COI)
issues,
it’s
important
to
understand,
broadly,
the 
purpose
of
a
COI
and
why
certificates
are
needed.
Specifically,
what
is
and
what
isn’t
a
COI? 
A
“certificate
of
insurance”
is
a
term
that
may
be
applied
to
many
types
of
informational
documents.
For 
example,
group
life
and
health
policies
usually
involve
a
master
policy
where
benefits
are
summarized
in 
a
“certificate”
issued
to
the
individual
members.
“Certificates”
may
be
issued
on
some
builders
risk
or 
wrap-up
projects
to
indicate
some
form
of
insured
status
or
insurable
interest.
There
are
several
liability 
“certificates”
that
may
be
required
under
state
or
federal
motor
carrier
acts.
Some
policies
are
extended 
with
renewal
“certificates,”
and
facultative
reinsurance
may
be
initially
bound
with
reinsurance 
“certificates.” 
These
are
not
the
types
of
“certificates
of
insurance”
addressed
in
this
course. 
A
“certificate
of
insurance,”
as
discussed
here,
refers
to
a
noncontractual
document
providing
evidence 
that
certain
general
types
of insurance coverages
and
limits
have
been
purchased
by
the
party
required
to 
furnish
the certificate. 
According
to
Allan
D.
Windt
in
Insurance
Claims
&
Disputes:
Representation
of
Insurance
Companies 
and
Insureds:
3 
A
certificate
of
insurance
is
a
document
issued
by
or
on
behalf
of
an
insurance
company
to
a
third 
party
who
has
not
contracted
with
the
insurer
to
purchase
an
insurance
policy.
The
most
common 
type
of
certificate
is
that
provided
for
informational
purposes
to
advise
a
third
party
of
the
existence 
and
amount
of
insurance
issued
to
the
named
insured. 
The
2013
11th
edition
of
Black’s
Law
Dictionary
defines
a
certificate
of
insurance
to
be 
A
document
acknowledging
that
an
insurance
policy
has
been
written,
and
setting
forth
in
general 
terms
what
the
policy
covers. 
Saying
that
a
certificate
identifies
policy
terms
on
a
very
“general”
basis
is
an
understatement.
In
many 
instances,
the
greatest
concern
about
COIs
is
not
what
they
say
but,
rather,
what
they
don’t
say.
A
COI 
usually
serves
as
a
reasonably
good
documentation
that
coverage
exists
but
not
the
extent
of
that
coverage 
and
not
what
limitations
or
exclusions
might
apply. 
COIs
are
most
often
issued
in
conjunction
with
a
contractual
relationship
between
a
third
party
and
the 
named
insured
where
the
contract
requires
particular
types
and
amounts
of
insurance.
These
contractual 
relationships
most
often
arise
in
the
construction
industry,
are
created
by
lease
or
loan
documents,
or
are 
otherwise
required
of
third-party
service
providers
by
businesses
and
government
entities
where 
significant
legal
liability
exposures
or
property
assets
are
at
risk. 
3Important:
In
this
course,
a
“certificate
of
insurance”
or
an
“evidence
of
insurance”
may,
for
brevity’s 
sake,
be
referred
to
as
simply
a
“certificate”
or
by
the
acronym
“COI.” 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
identify
the
primary
source
of
COI
requests,
•
recognize
the
overall
purpose
and
value
of
COIs,
and
•
identify
the
general
deficiencies
and
limitations
of
COIs.
What
Is
a
Certificate?
A
COI
is
a
snapshot
that
indicates
that
an
insurance
policy
exists
at
the
time
the
certificate
was
issued 
with
limits
shown
being
those
that
existed
when
the
policy
was
issued. 
Certificates
are
issued
for
general
informational
purposes
only
and
confer
no
rights
on
the
holder;
that 
secondary
fact
is
usually
expressed
by
disclaimers
on
the
certificate
and/or
established
by
law
in
the
form 
of
statutes,
regulations,
or
regulatory
directives. 
The
certificate
is
subject
to
all
the
terms,
exclusions,
and
conditions
of
the
policy
referenced
on
the 
certificate. 
What
Isn’t
a
Certificate?
As
established
in
U.S.
Pipe
&
Foundry
Co.
v.
U.S.
Fid.
&
Guar.
Co.
4
and
Lezak
&
Levy
Wholesale
Meats, 
Inc.
v.
Illinois
Employers
Ins.
Co.
of
Wausau
5
,
a
certificate
is
not
a
contract
because
it
usually
does
not 
meet
the
requirements
of
a
contract,
most
often
the
primary
reason
being
that
there
is
no
consideration 
exchanged
by
the
parties.
The
requestor
typically
pays
nothing
for
a
certificate,
and
the
issuer
warrants 
nothing
in
the
form
of
coverage.
If
a
certification
or
evidence
document
is
desired
with
contractual
teeth, 
the
certificate
holder
should
request
a
certified
copy
of
the
policy
or,
if
the
policy
is
not
yet
available,
an 
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and
Development
(ACORD)
75
Insurance
Binder, 
which
has
the
contractual
effect
of
the
policy
it
represents. 
A
certificate
does
not
represent
compliance
with
any
contracts
entered
into
by
the
insured,
and
ACORD 
form
disclaimers
make
that
clear,
as
discussed
later
in
this
course.
Compliance
of
a
policy
with
the 
insurance
requirements
of
a
contract
is
best
determined
by
the
author
of
the
contract. 
A
certificate
does
not
amend,
extend,
or
alter
the
coverage
or
terms
afforded
by
an
insurance
policy, 
again,
as
ACORD
form
disclaimers
make
clear. 
Likewise,
as
discussed
later
in
this
course,
neither
a
certificate
nor
any
supplemental
certification 
document
accompanying
a
certificate
serves
as
a
warranty
of
coverage
by
the
issuing
agent
or
insurer. 
Summary
While
COIs
are
the
primary
documents
used
to
certify
that
insurance
coverage
exists
and
to
what
extent 
and
terms,
and
they
most
often
do
contain
reliable
basic
information
about
an
entity’s
insurance
program, 
they
have
inherent
limitations
that
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
insurance
program
fully 
complies
with
contractual
requirements.

The
Need
for
Proof
of
Insurance
Overview
Society
recognizes
the
risks
inherent
in
operating
motor
vehicles
on
public
roads.
As
a
result,
state 
governments
have
universally
mandated
liability
insurance
or
imposed
comparable
financial 
responsibility
on
the
operators
of
motor
vehicles.
The
same
is
true
of
private
industry
for
other
forms
of 
liability
often
created
by
business
relationships.
In
addition,
when
an
entity
has
an
insurable
interest
in 
property,
it
may
mandate
insurance
coverage
be
provided
by
other
parties
with
an
interest
in
that
property.
When
significant
liability
exposures
or
property
assets
are
at
stake,
the
existence
of
insurance
becomes
a 
primary
concern.
Issues
involving
liability
certificates
probably
most
often
arise
in
the
construction 
industry.
For
asset
protection,
property
certificates
are
a
primary
focus
of
lenders
and
landlords,
with
the 
latter
also
being
especially
concerned
about
their
liability
exposure. 
This
concern
creates
a
need
for
proof
of
the
existence
of
insurance,
which
has
historically
been
the
role
of 
certificates
of
insurance
(COIs).

provides
an
overview
of
the
insurance
needs
of
contractors, 
lenders,
landlords,
and
others
and
identifies
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
COIs.
Included
is
an 
introduction
to
some
of
the
potentially
problematic
requests
made
of
agents
and
insurers.
Some
of
these 
requests
lead
to
resistance
by
the
agent
or
insurer
to
issue
a
certificate,
so
it’s
important
for
all
parties
to 
understand
the
potential
repercussions
of
refusal
to
comply
with
insurance
or
COI
demands. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
identify
certificate
issues
surrounding
the
construction,
lending,
and
real
estate
industries;
•
recognize
the
benefits
provided
by
COIs;
•
identify
important
deficiencies
in
COIs
as
a
vehicle
for
affirming
that
insurance
programs
comply 
with
contract
requirements;
and
•
recognize
the
repercussions
of
failing
to
issue
COIs
exactly
as
requested.
Insuring
the
Independent
Contractor
Exposure
A
construction
project
might
involve
a
project
owner,
general
contractor,
and
various
subcontractors.
5From
a
subcontractor’s
viewpoint,
the
general
contractor
and
project
owner
are
referred
to
as
“upstream” 
parties,
as
illustrated
in
the
following
exhibit.
From
the
project
owner’s
perspective,
the
general 
contractor
and
subcontractors
are
all
“downstream”
parties.
From
the
general
contractor’s
position,
the 
project
owner
is
an
“upstream”
party,
and
a
subcontractor
is
a
“downstream”
party.
Upstream
parties 
usually
dictate
insurance
and
indemnification
requirements
for
downstream
parties
and
want
some 
reasonably
dependable
certification
of
compliance. 
6Upstream
and
Downstream
Parties
to
a
Construction
Contract
 
If
you
hire
independent
contractors,
you
could
be
sued
directly
or
for
your
vicarious
liability
for
their 
actions.
That’s
why
you
buy
your
own
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
coverage.
In
the
case
of 
workers
compensation,
you
might
be
held
liable
for
injuries
to
an
independent
contractor’s
employees
if 
that
contractor
has
no
workers
compensation
insurance.
The
premium
on
your
own
policies
is
usually 
reduced
if
the
independent
contractors
are
insured.
This
is
one
reason
why
you
want
that
downstream 
party
to
provide
evidence
of
insurance,
usually
accomplished
by
the
issuance
of
a
COI. 
Many
businesses
use
independent
contractors.
While
the
“principal”
hiring
the
contractor
is
at
least 
theoretically
not
liable
for
the
actions
of
a
truly
independent
contractor,
third
parties
can
make
claims
or 
sue
the
principal
on
the
basis
that
the
work
was
inherently
dangerous,
the
principal
supplied
defective 
tools
or
equipment,
negligently
hired
or
supervised
the
contractor,
etc.
In
other
words,
an
astute
attorney 
will
often
find
some
premise
for
liability
of
the
principal
for
the
contractor.
The
plaintiff
might
not
win
a 
lawsuit,
but
defense
costs
alone
could
be
substantial. 
A
CGL
policy
protects
the
principal
from
suits
based
on
direct
or
vicarious
liability
for
the
contractor’s 
actions.
A
CGL
insuring
agreement
typically
says
that
coverage
applies
to
the
insured
if
they
are
“legally 
obligated”
for
a
loss
without
regard
to
the
cause
of
the
loss.
So,
while
an
independent
contractor
may
not 
be
an
“insured”
under
the
principal’s
CGL
policy,
the
principal
is
covered
for
the
contractor’s
negligence. 
However,
most
businesses
will
still
insist
that
contractors
bear
the
responsibility
of
claims
or
suits
for 
which
they
are
responsible. 
So,
principals
have
at
least
four
ways
of
protecting
themselves
for
claims
against
them
that
arise
out
of
an 
independent
contractor’s
actions,
and
it
is
worthwhile
to
momentarily
digress
to
discuss
them. 
1.
Require
a
hold
harmless
or
indemnification
agreement
2.
Rely
on
the
principal’s
own
CGL
policy
3.
Be
named
as
an
additional
insured
(AI)
under
the
contractor’s
CGL
4.
Require
the
contractor
to
furnish
an
owners
and
contractors
protective
(OCP)
liability
policy
Hold
Harmless
or
Indemnification
Agreements
7While
a
hold
harmless
agreement
in
the
form
of
an
indemnification
clause
is
a
good
idea,
it
isn’t
adequate 
by
itself
unless
it
is
certain
that
the
contractor
has
the
financial
resources
to
pay
all
claims
against
the 
owner
for
which
the
contractor
is
liable.
In
addition,
the
owner
may
have
to
file
suit
to
enforce
the 
agreement,
and
the
third-party
claimant
isn’t
interested
in
that;
they
just
want
their
money.
As
a
result, 
sound
risk
management
dictates
the
need
for
a
“belt
and
suspenders”
approach
that
includes
both 
indemnification
and
insurance
requirements.
More
on
this
in
Chapter
3. 
Principal’s
CGL
Sole
reliance
on
the
principal’s
own
CGL,
if
the
owner
is
using
a
significant
number
of
contractors,
could 
quickly
result
in
a
depletion
of
the
aggregate
limits,
although
it
does
give
the
owner
greater
control
over 
their
defense.
A
central
tenet
of
our
legal
system
is
that
tortfeasors
should
be
responsible
for
their
own 
actions.
If
you
include
the
element
of
making
business
decisions,
reliance
on
your
own
CGL
for
the 
negligence
of
others
probably
doesn’t
make
good
business
sense,
nor
does
the
including
loss
experience 
from
an
outside
party
in
your
own
CGL
make
sense. 
AI
Status
Complete
reliance
on
coverage
as
an
AI
under
someone
else’s
policy
is
rarely
a
good
risk
management 
decision.
While
being
an
AI
is
generally
better
than
not
being
one,
it
should
not
be
the
primary
means
of 
risk
transfer.
You
depend
on
the
other
party
to
maintain
the
insurance
in
force
and
at
adequate
limits,
and 
their
aggregate
limit
could
be
diminished
without
the
owner’s
knowledge.
As
an
AI
(and
possibly
one
of 
many
AIs),
the
owner
must
share
limits
with
a
potentially
large
group
of
insureds,
so
there
might
not
be 
much
insurance
from
the
standpoint
of
limits
to
share.
The
owner
will
also
want
to
make
sure
that
the 
policy
under
which
they
are
named
as
an
AI
will
be
primary
coverage,
with
the
owner’s
CGL
being 
excess. 
OCP
Coverage
An
owners
and
contractors
protective
(OCP)
liability
policy
is
an
alternative
to
just
naming
the
owner
as 
an
AI,
though
each
method
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages.
An
OCP
policy
is
usually
purchased
by 
the
contractor,
with
the
principal
being
the
named
insured. 
The
main
financial
downside
of
an
OCP
(from
the
contractor’s
standpoint)
is
that
there
is
obviously
an 
additional
premium
that
they
have
to
pay
to
benefit
the
owner
as
named
insured.
However,
the
premium 
is
often
quite
affordable,
and
the
named
insured
has
a
whole
new
set
of
limits
on
which
to
draw,
and
those 
limits
are
primary
over
any
other
coverage
the
owner
has. 
The
coverage
itself
is
similar
to
being
an
AI,
though
coverage
under
the
OCP
is
not
as
broad
as
the
CGL, 
and
OCP
coverage
only
applies
if
the
named
insured
is
held
vicariously
liable
for
loss
arising
out
of
the 
acts
of
the
designated
contractor. 
The
OCP
does
not
include
products-completed
operations
coverage;
once
the
work
ends,
the
insurance 
ends
under
an
OCP.
Also,
the
OCP
doesn’t
include
personal
injury
coverage,
if
that’s
an
issue. 
As
an
AI,
the
client
usually
is
not
entitled
to
notice
of
cancellation,
but
as
the
named
insured
on
an
OCP, 
they
would
be.
That
could
be
of
critical
importance. 
The
above
discussion
assumes
“ISO
standard”
coverage
forms
from
industry-standard
advisory 
organization
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO).
6
Many
insurance
companies
use
their
own
versions
of 
these
forms
and/or
may
manuscript
them,
particularly
AI
endorsements.
Beware
of
some
of
these 
proprietary
AI
forms,
especially
if
they
include
defense
within
limits
and
other
limitations
touched
on 
later
in
this
course. 
Loan
and
Lease
Requirements
Lenders
have
increasingly
become
more
specific
and
broader
in
their
insurance
requirements,
and
they 
often
use
antiquated
and
inappropriate
language,
such
as
“all
risks”
coverage,
in
their
requests.
Coverage 
for
100
percent
of
replacement
cost
is
typically
required,
and
some
lenders
define
what
they
mean
by 
“replacement
cost.”
Loan
insurance
requirements
often
address
ordinance
or
law,
earthquake,
sinkhole
8and
flood
coverage,
or
margin
clauses,
and
they
may
limit
or
prohibit
the
use
of
coinsurance
on
property 
and/or
business
income
coverage.
Requests
for
AI
status
on
CGL
and
auto
policies
are
increasingly 
common.
Astute
agents
have
even
caught
requirements
for
AI
status
on
workers
compensation
policies
in 
some
loan
agreements. 
In
the
case
of
leases,
agents
all
too
often
only
review
the
insurance
requirements,
overlooking
related 
indemnification
and
damage
and
destruction
clauses.
Responsibility
for
tenants’
improvements
and 
betterments
(TIBs)
is
often
spelled
out,
and
tenants
may
be
responsible
for
build-outs
not
included
in
TIB 
coverage
in
their
tenant
property
policies,
requiring
that
they
directly
insure
such
exposures
in
those 
forms.
Especially
under
triple-net
leases,
landlords
typically
want
to
be
added
as
an
AI
on
a
form
like 
ISO’s
Additional
Insured—Building
Owner
(CP
12
19).
Some
landlords
may
insist
on
AI
status
under 
business
income
forms
providing
rental
value
coverage
such
as
ISO’s
Business
Income—Landlord
as 
Additional
Insured
(Rental
Value)
(CP
15
03)
endorsement. 
Other
Situations
COIs
may
also
be
required
under
various
service
contracts
or
co-ownership
situations
such
as 
condominium
associations.
Under
condo
covenants,
conditions,
and
restrictions,
condo
associations
may 
request
AI
status,
or,
worse,
individual
unit
lenders
may
want
AI
status
on
master
policies,
something 
few,
if
any,
underwriters
are
willing
to
do. 
Benefits
of
Certificates
COIs
are
not
complete
representations
of
policy
coverages,
nor
are
they
conclusive
evidence
that
the 
coverage
provided
meets
contract
specifications,
but
they
are
certainly
not
worthless,
and
they
potentially 
provide
benefits
to
all
parties
involved
in
the
process.
Benefits
include
the
following. 
•
A
COI
confirms
and
summarizes
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
provide
certain
coverages
and
limits.
•
A
certificate
simplifies
communication
by
providing
basic
information,
especially
if
a
claim 
occurs.
•
A
certificate
identifies
and
evidences
coverage
for
claims
filed
many
years
down
the
road.
•
Evidence
of
a
downstream
party’s
insurance
prevents
an
upstream
party
from
being
charged
on
its 
policy(ies)
for
the
downstream
party’s
exposure,
especially
workers
compensation
where
laws 
make
the
upstream
party
responsible
for
compensating
the
employees
of
uninsured
downstream 
parties.
•
The
failure
to
request
a
COI
might
be
alleged
to
imply
a
waiving
of
insurance
requirements
or 
indemnity
obligations
under
a
contract.
For
example,
in
Geier
v.
Hamer
Enters.,
Inc.
7
,
the
contract 
provided
that
work
was
not
to
begin
until
COIs
had
been
provided.
The
owner
allowed
the
work
to 
begin
without
COIs,
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
owner
had
effectively
waived
the
contractual 
obligation
of
the
contractor
to
procure
liability
insurance.
•
While
disclaimers
primarily
protect
the
COI
issuer,
disclaimers
may
protect
the
COI
holder
from 
insurer
attempts
to
limit
coverage.
For
example,
in
J.A.
Jones
Constr.
Co.
v.
Hartford
Fire
Ins.
Co. 
8
,
a
disclaimer
that
the
COI
does
not
amend,
extend,
or
alter
coverage
prohibited
the
insurer
from 
attempting
to
limit
an
AI’s
coverage
to
vicarious
liability
only.
•
Depending
on
the
legal
jurisdiction
and
the
facts
of
the
case,
a
certificate
may
benefit
a
certificate 
holder
by
serving
as
evidence
that
an
agent
failed
to
procure
the
proper
coverage
or
otherwise 
made
statements
that
the
certificate
holder
relied
on
to
their
detriment.
Even
if
the
certificate
holder 
cannot
access
the
policies
referenced
on
the
certificate,
the
agent’s
errors
and
omissions
(E&O) 
policy
might
serve
as
a
source
of
recovery
for
otherwise
uninsured
losses.
Deficiencies
of
Certificates
Just
as
certificates
serve
a
beneficial
purpose,
they
also
have
deficiencies
as
a
means
of
certifying 
insurance
coverage,
limits,
and
terms.
More
often
than
not,
these
deficiencies
impact
the
certificate
holder
9more
than
the
agent
or
insurer. 
•
ACORD
certificate
disclaimers
have
been
extensively
tested
in
many
legal
jurisdictions
and,
by 
and
large,
have
been
upheld
as
not
affording
any
coverage
or
otherwise
altering
the
terms
of
the 
referenced
insurance
policies.
•
If
coverage
has
been
bound
but
not
issued,
a
certificate
may
reference
an
insurance
contract
that 
ultimately
is
never
issued
or
that
is
issued
only
to
be
canceled
in
short
order
because
of 
underwriting
decisions.
This
is
one
reason
why
a
binder,
lacking
in
disclaimers
found
on 
certificates,
serves
as
the
more
appropriate
and
reliable
initial
indication
of
coverage
than
a 
certificate.
•
A
certificate
is
no
guarantee
that
a
referenced
policy
or
necessary
endorsements
actually
exist
or 
that
the
coverage
complies
with
the
contract
requiring
certain
forms
or
terms
of
insurance.
If
an 
absolute
guarantee
of
coverage
is
necessary,
the
only
way
to
verify
it
is
to
examine
the
actual 
insurance
contract(s).
•
Certificates
usually
only
reference
primary
policy
forms
and
not
exclusionary
or
restrictive 
endorsements.
For
example,
a
company
bidding
on
removing
19
trees
from
a
residential
property 
provided
a
COI
that
indicated
that
a
current
ISO
CGL
policy
was
in
place.
However,
the
COI
did 
not
mention
the
42
endorsements
attached,
one
of
which
excluded
“ongoing
operations”
and
“your 
work.”
At
one
time,
the
ACORD
25—Certificate
of
Liability
Insurance
form
specified
that
the 
description
of
operations
field
could
be
used
to
list
exclusionary
endorsements,
but
that
instruction 
was
removed
from
the
form,
as
discussed
later
in
this
course.
•
Although
the
ACORD
25
has
a
field
to
indicate,
via
checkmark,
that
AI
status
has
been
provided, 
there
is
no
guarantee
that
it
actually
has
or
that
the
AI
status
meets
contractual
requirements.
An 
internal
study
by
the
city
of
Atlanta’s
risk
management
department
found
that
40
percent
of
COIs 
that
indicated
AI
coverage
did
not
actually
have
such
coverage.
A
similar
result
was
found
in 
independent
studies
conducted
in
two
insurance
agencies.
In
addition,
where
AI
coverage
is 
provided
by
an
“automatic”
endorsement
or
policy
provision,
such
coverage
is
usually
triggered 
only
by
a
requirement
in
a
written
contract,
and
work
often
begins
without
a
written
contract
or 
before
it
is
executed.
•
As
disclaimed
on
the
ACORD
25,
aggregate
limits
could
have
been
impaired.
The
limits
shown
on 
an
ACORD
certificate
are
usually
the
limits
shown
on
a
policy’s
declarations
page,
and
those 
aggregate
limits
could
have
been
reduced
or
exhausted
by
claims,
including
those
of
which
the 
issuing
agent
is
not
even
aware.
•
Deductibles
and
self-insured
retentions
(SIRs)
are
usually
not
included
on
the
ACORD
25
for
CGL 
or
other
coverages
other
than
perhaps
excess
or
umbrella
liability
coverages.
In
the
2013
case
of 
Multicare
Health
Sys.
v.
Lexington
Ins.
Co.
9
,
the
court
found
that
the
absence
of
an
ACORD
25 
field
or
column
for
listing
an
SIR
on
a
professional
liability
policy
precluded
a
claim
because
of
its 
absence.
A
staffing
company
with
a
professional
liability
policy
had
contracted
with
Multicare,
but 
the
COI
provided
to
Multicare
did
not
reveal
that
the
policy
included
a
$1
million
SIR.
The 
staffing
company
ultimately
went
bankrupt
and
was
unable
to
pay
a
$785,000
malpractice 
judgment
within
the
SIR.
According
to
the
court,
it
did
not
believe
“…
that
the
Washington 
Supreme
Court
would
find
a
duty
to
disclose
a
self-insured
retention
amount
on
a
certificate
that 
summarizes
insurance
policies
and
does
not
contain
a
column
for
retention
or
deductible
amounts. 
This
is
especially
true
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
hospital
could
have
asked
[the
staffing
company] 
for
a
copy
of
its
insurance
policy.”
•
ACORD
certificates
do
not
provide
for
any
notification
of
cancellation,
nonrenewal,
reduction
in 
coverage,
or
any
other
policy
deficiency
unless
provided
by
the
policy
itself.
•
Certificate
fraud
by
insureds
and
sometimes
agents
happens.
In
one
regulatory
action,
COIs
were 
being
sold
to
contractors
for
$10
each
behind
a
Home
Depot.
In
another
case,
an
Alabama
agent 
admitted
to
knowingly
providing
false
information
on
a
COI,
yet
the
court
refused
to
find
coverage
10under
the
COI
because
of
the
disclaimers.
(That
doesn’t
mean
that
the
certificate
holder
and 
insurance
regulator
don’t
have
recourse
via
fraud
or
other
laws.)
Alternatives
to
Certificates
Although
standardized
COIs
are
not
worthless,
they
obviously
have
potentially
significant
deficiencies. 
As
a
result,
some
entities
prescribe,
where
permitted
by
law,
their
own
proprietary
certificates
or 
memoranda
of
insurance,
many
without
the
court-tested
disclaimers
of
ACORD
forms.
Other
entities
may 
insist
on
certificate
supplements
in
the
form
of
agent
affidavits
or
warranties,
as
discussed
later
in
this 
chapter
and
elsewhere
in
this
course.
The
reality,
though,
is
that
the
only
reliable
alternative
to
a
COI
is
to 
obtain
and
read
the
policy(ies)
required
by
the
contract
between
business
partners
or,
in
the
case
of 
lenders,
the
loan
agreement
or
deed
of
trust.
Needless
to
say,
this
requires
very
specialized
expertise
and 
can
entail
significant
costs. 
Five
Types
of
Potentially
Problematic
Certificate
Requests
Agents
are
sometimes
unnecessarily
burdened
by
requests
involving
COIs.
When
those
requests
go 
beyond
the
norm,
they
may
be
faced
with
professional
liability
(E&O)
lawsuits
by
certificate
holders 
and/or
AIs,
subject
to
regulatory
discipline,
or
worse.
Over
the
past
couple
of
decades,
agents
have
been 
increasingly
asked
to
assume
risks,
perform
tasks
for
which
they
are
sometimes
unqualified,
and
provide 
uncompensated
services
whose
benefits
accrue
largely
to
parties
with
which
they
have
no
direct
business 
relationship.
At
the
same
time,
agents
have
become
increasingly
hamstrung
by
legal
and
regulatory 
restrictions,
many
of
them
imposed
at
the
request
of
agent
trade
associations
to
minimize
agency
E&O 
exposures. 
As
a
result,
agents
are
sometimes
asked
to
do
things
for
these
third
parties
that
are
possibly
“illegal”
or 
otherwise
inappropriate,
impractical,
or
even
impossible.
The
following
is
a
list
of
examples
of
such 
requests.
More
specific
illustrations
are
provided
later
in
this
course,
along
with
suggestions
on
why
such 
requests
may
be
unreasonable
and
how
the
agent
might
respond. 
•
“Illegal”
requests.
Some
certificate
requests
violate
laws,
regulations,
or
regulatory
directives.
For 
example,
a
request
for
coverage
for
an
AI’s
sole
negligence
may
violate
or
conflict
with 
anti-indemnity
statutes.
In
one
such
instance,
a
requestor
said
this
requirement
was
“standard 
practice”
in
the
industry,
and
if
the
agent
wouldn’t
do
it,
he
had
a
list
of
agents
who
would.
The 
agent
refused
to
comply
because
it
was
illegal
in
that
state.
In
another
case,
that
agent
was
required 
to
include
the
following
statement
on
the
COI:
“Insurance
complies
with
contract
indemnity 
agreement.”
No
such
policy
existed
in
the
marketplace.
This
statement
would
be
a 
misrepresentation
of
the
policy,
and
the
state
had
a
COI-specific
law
prohibiting
misrepresentative 
statements
on
COIs
or
“agent
opinion
letters.”
A
similar
situation
arose
when
an
agent
was
asked 
to
state
that
a
policy
insured
“ANY
contractual
liabilities
and
indemnities
assumed
by
Contractor.” 
In
both
instances,
the
agents
refused
to
comply
because
the
statements
would
not
be
truthful.
•
Uninsurable
requests.
A
construction
contract
required
a
November
1985
edition
of
an
ISO
AI 
endorsement
“without
substitutions,”
but
none
of
the
insurers
represented
by
the
agent
offered
that 
edition
of
the
ISO
AI
endorsement.
In
some
regulatory
jurisdictions,
a
withdrawn
endorsement 
may
no
longer
be
approved
for
use.
And
some
forms
and
coverages
may
be
unavailable
to
the 
agent
or
in
the
marketplace
in
general.
The
lender
on
a
property
loan
wanted
to
be
an
“additional 
NAMED
insured”
on
the
insured’s
property,
business
income,
general
liability,
and
auto
policies, 
but
no
insurer
represented
by
the
agent
was
willing
to
do
this.
•
Inappropriate
requests.
Agents
may
be
asked
to
provide
warranties
of
coverage,
issue
“blank”
or 
“sample”
certificates,
remove
or
revise
disclaimer
language,
use
proprietary
COIs
or
modified 
ACORD
forms,
show
contract
rather
than
policy
limits,
or
provide
information
that
conflicts
with 
the
ACORD
Forms
Instruction
Guide
instructions
for
a
particular
field
in
a
form.
A
Florida
bank 
branch
would
not
close
a
loan
until
the
insurance
agent
provided
a
replacement
cost
valuation
of 
the
building.
The
bank
admitted
that
it
used
to
hire
someone
to
do
this
but
was
sued
twice
for 
erroneous
valuations,
so
apparently
it
preferred
to
transfer
this
potential
liability
to
the
agent.
A
11hotel
attorney
wanted
the
agent
of
an
insured
who
was
renting
a
hotel
meeting
room
to
show
the 
CGL
limit
on
a
COI
as
“Enough.”
These
are
all
arguably
inappropriate
requests.
•
Impractical
requests.
An
“impractical”
request
is
one
that
is
possible,
but
compliance
or 
noncompliance
requires
a
business
decision
due
to
the
time
and
cost
involved
or
a
heightened 
liability
exposure
for
the
agent.
Some
agencies
experience
such
requests
on
almost
a
daily
basis,
so 
the
following
are
several
examples
to
illustrate
how
extreme
such
requests
can
be.
 
The
mortgagee
for
a
condo
unit
purchaser
wanted
to
be
named
as
an
AI
on
the
800-unit
association 
master
policy.
Imagine
if
all
800
unit
mortgagees
want
the
same
status,
especially
given
how
often 
mortgages
are
sold
and
transferred
between
lending
institutions.
Making
these
changes
would 
place
an
undue
burden
on
agencies,
especially
if
every
sale
of
a
mortgage
required
an
adjustment 
in
the
identities
of
AIs.
A
community
developer,
when
learning
that
no
cancellation
notice
would
be
provided
to
it
as
a 
certificate
holder,
issued
the
following
demand
of
the
insured:
“Effective
immediately,
in
order
to 
process
payment
for
your
invoices,
we
must
receive
a
certificate
of
insurance
from
your
insurance 
broker
by
the
10th
day
of
each
month,
stating
and
verifying
that
each
of
your
policies
are
in
full 
force
and
effect.”
The
unreasonableness
of
this
demand
is
obvious.
 
A
project
owner
attempted
to
require
the
following:
“Workers
Compensation
certificate
must 
include
a
list
of
the
names
of
each
employee
that
will
be
working
on
this
project.
Employees
will
be 
checked
daily
for
verification.
Subcontractor’s
employees
that
show
up
for
work
that
are
not 
specifically
identified
by
the
work
comp
carrier
will
not
be
allowed
to
work
without
a
new 
certificate
listing
them
by
name.
A
simple
‘All
employees
are
covered’
is
NOT
acceptable
on
the 
certificate.” 
One
Monday
morning
between
8:00
and
9:00
a.m.,
an
agency
customer
service
representative 
(CSR)
had
13
requests
for
evidences
of
insurance
from
13
different
banks.
Why?
The
banks
were
all 
being
audited,
and,
as
allegedly
suggested
by
the
auditors,
it
was
easier
for
them
to
call
the
agency 
for
COIs
previously
issued
than
locate
them
in
their
own
files.
Shortly
after
9:00
a.m.,
a
contractor 
stopped
by
to
pick
up
a
COI
from
the
same
CSR
that
he
had
picked
up
the
previous
week
and
hand 
delivered
to
a
general
contractor.
Why?
The
contractor
said
they
were
setting
up
a
new
file
and 
didn’t
want
to
make
a
copy
of
the
COI,
so
they
refused
to
pay
him
until
he
gave
them
another 
original
certificate.
These
requests
took
the
CSR
out
of
commission
for
a
half
day,
and
an
agency 
owner
spent
all
morning
playing
phone
tag
with
13
banks
explaining
why
their
requests
were 
impractical. 
The
following
was
an
insurance
requirement
for
a
contractor. 
◦
ISO
“or
equivalent”
CGL
policy
with
$1
million/$2
million
Coverage
A
limits
including 
products-completed
operations
coverage,
$1
million
Coverage
B,
$5,000
Coverage
C,
and 
$50,000
fire
damage
legal
liability
◦
Blanket
contractual
coverage
(including
coverage
for
indemnity
agreement)
◦
Products-completed
operations
coverage
to
be
maintained
2
years
following
completion
of 
work
◦
Deletion
of
employee
and
contractual
exclusions
from
PI
coverage
◦
Broad
form
property
damage
liability
◦
Independent
contractor
liability
◦
Waiver
of
subrogation
using
CG

11
85
“or
equivalent”
◦
At
least
30
days’
notice
of
cancellation
or
material
change
◦
Modification
of
“Other
Insurance”
clause
of
contractor’s
CGL
policy
to
clarify
that
it
is 
primary
and
noncontributory
to
any
insurance
carried
by
the
requestor
or
its
customers
12◦
AI
endorsement
to
be
maintained
for
2
years
following
completion
of
work
identifying
the 
following
as
AIs:
“XYZ
and
its
customers
and
all
respective
directors,
officers,
employees, 
agents,
subsidiaries,
divisions,
affiliates
and
successors
with
respect
to
liability
for
bodily 
injury,
property
damage
or
personal
and
advertising
injury
caused
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the 
acts
or
omissions
of
either
you
or
the
additional
insureds.”
(Note:
This
requires
that
the
sole 
negligence
of
the
AI
be
covered.)
The
problems
with
the
above
requests
regarding
the
contractor’s
insurance
program
are
self-evident 
as
to
insurability,
legality,
appropriateness,
etc.,
but
the
“impractical”
aspect
is
that
the
contracting 
job
consisted
of
an
individual
who
was
being
paid
$80
to
shovel
snow
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
a 
store. 
•
Impossible
requests.
A
risk
manager
requested
that
the
certificate
state
that
the
policy
would
“… 
cover
contracts,
without
exception,
that
Subcontractor
has
signed
with
Contractor
or
is
going
to 
sign
.”
In
another
case,
a
subcontractor
had
applied
for
a
loan
or
grant
from
the
US
Small
Business 
Administration
(SBA),
which
included
a
number
of
insurance
requirements
specified
on
10
pages
of 
the
application,
including
the
following. 
◦
“Commercial
General
Liability
(2002
or
2003
ISO
Occurrence
Form
or
its
equivalent)
is 
provided.”
There
was
no
2002
or
2003
countrywide
ISO
CGL
form.
The
“ISO
or 
equivalent”
issue
is
discussed
later
in
this
course.
◦
“For
those
policies
containing
an
aggregate,
as
soon
as
loss
activity
(paid
or
reserve) 
depletes
the
aggregate
by
50%
or
more,
written
notice
must
be
sent
to
the
Contractor
by 
certified
mail.”
◦
“Additional
insured
endorsements
shall
not
contain
any
restrictions.”
Liability
insurance
evidence
was
required
to
be
included
on
an
ACORD
27
(a
property
form)
to 
verify
coverage
for
CGL
and
workers
compensation,
also
insisting
that
the
SBA
be
named
as
an
AI 
on
the
workers
compensation
policy.
The
agent
refused
to
use
the
ACORD
27
to
evidence
liability 
coverage
and
advised
that
it
was
impossible
to
extend
AI
coverage
to
the
SBA
for
workers 
compensation
insurance.
An
SBA
attorney
claimed
he
knew
of
at
least
50
agents
who
had
done
this. 
The
agent
refused,
and
the
attorney
backed
off,
accepting
the
ACORD
25
for
the
liability
coverages. 
Keep
in
mind
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
certificate
or
insurance
coverage
requests:
(1)
wish
lists,
(2) 
fallback
positions,
and
(3)
deal
breakers.
Contract
drafters
sometimes
include
requests
they
know
are 
unreasonable,
but
there
is
no
downside
to
asking,
and
astute
attorneys
know
that
some
agents
will
agree
to 
almost
anything
on
the
premise
that
it
is
unlikely
that
an
uncovered
claim
will
occur,
or,
if
it
does,
they 
have
E&O
coverage. 
More
often,
the
upstream
party
would
like
to
transfer
as
much
liability
to
the
downstream
party
as 
possible,
but
they
have
a
fallback
position
when
they
encounter
an
agent
who
pushes
back
and,
because
of 
the
value
of
the
services
provided
by
the
agent’s
customer,
they
are
willing
to
continue
to
assume
that
risk 
under
their
own
insurance
programs. 
However,
there
are
some
insurance
requirements
that
are
simply
nonnegotiable,
especially
when
there
are 
other
downstream
parties
willing
and
able
to
comply
with
such
requirements.
That’s
when
an
insured
or 
its
agent
must
make
a
business
decision
about
assuming
risk
they’d
prefer
not
to. 
Repercussions
of
Refusal
To
Comply
with
Certificate
Demands
If
an
agent
cannot
or
will
not
comply
with
an
insurance
or
service
requirement
in
a
contract
into
which 
their
customer
has
entered,
there
are
several
potential
outcomes.
13•
The
insured
may
be
denied
a
job.
•
If
the
job
is
already
underway,
the
insured
may
be
accused
of
breach
of
contract
with
the 
corresponding
penalties
that
may
entail.
In
such
cases,
the
insured
may
settle
by
passing
along
its 
right
to
sue
its
own
agent
to
the
upstream
party,
which
then
sues
the
agent,
not
as
a
certificate 
holder,
but
under
the
same
cause
of
action
as
the
subcontractor.
•
The
insured’s
payment
may
be
withheld
for
a
completed
job,
or
the
insured
may
be
docked
to
the 
extent
of
the
upstream
party’s
cost
of
substitute
coverage.
•
Needless
to
say,
if
any
of
the
above
occur,
a
potential
repercussion
for
the
agent
is
the
loss
of
an 
account.
•
An
insured
might
commit
fraud;
if
the
agent
refuses
to
issue
a
certificate
with
certain
verbiage,
the 
insured
might
provide
a
fraudulent
certificate
to
the
upstream
party.
As
mentioned
earlier
in
Geiere
v.
Hamer
Enters.,
Inc.
10
,
in
case
of
refusal
to
pay,
the
upstream
party
may 
have
been
deemed
by
some
courts
to
have
waived
contract
requirements
if
the
downstream
party
was 
allowed
to
begin
and/or
complete
work
without
a
COI
or
without
a
COI
that
met
contract
requirements. 
As
found
in
JCM
Constr.
Co.,
Inc.
v.
Orleans
Parish
Sch.
Bd.
11
,
the
same
thing
may
happen
following 
breach
of
contract
claims
arising
from
the
failure
to
issue
COIs. 
Summary
The
construction,
lending,
and
real
estate
industries
all
have
their
unique
requirements
and
considerations 
for
the
issuance
of
COIs.
While
COIs
are
generally
reliable
indicators
of
basic
insurance
coverages
and 
terms,
they
have
a
number
of
deficiencies
such
that,
if
a
guarantee
of
coverage
that
conforms
to 
contractual
requirements
is
necessary,
examination
of
the
policy
forms
themselves
is
likely
necessary. 
Some
contractual
certificate
and
insurance
requirements
may
be
illegal
or
impossible
for
the
agent
to 
fulfill.
Some
requirements
may
be
possible
but
could
potentially
impose
significant
professional
liability 
exposures
to
agents.
In
that
case,
the
agent
may
be
compelled
to
make
a
business
decision
as
to
whether 
or
not
to
comply
and
to
what
extent,
as
discussed
in
Chapter
4.

Contractual
Risk
Transfer
Overview
Since
the
issuance
of
most
certificates
of
insurance
(COIs)
begins
with
a
contractual
requirement,
it
is 
helpful
to
consider
some
of
the
fundamental
aspects
of
contractual
risk
transfer.
This
begins
by 
distinguishing
between
the
typical
indemnification
and
insurance
requirements
found
in
contracts, 
especially
in
the
construction
industry,
and
how
each
of
them
works
together
in
a
“belt
and
suspenders” 
approach
to
treating
risk.
12
Also
explored
in
this
chapter
are
the
overuse
of
antiquated
insurance
terms
in 
contracts
and
the
importance
(and
risks
from
the
agent’s
perspective)
in
reviewing
contracts
for
insureds.
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
the
basic
difference
between
indemnification
and
insurance,
•
recognize
why
risk
is
transferred
downstream,
•
distinguish
among
the
three
types
of
indemnification,
•
recognize
reasons
why
outdated
contract
language
should
be
avoided,
•
recognize
the
value
of
a
“belt
and
suspenders”
approach
to
risk
transfer,
and
•
recognize
the
pitfalls
of
reviewing
contracts
for
insureds.
Indemnification
versus
Insurance
Most
contracts
have
separate
indemnification
and
insurance
requirements,
but,
occasionally,
a
contract 
may
combine
the
two.
For
example, 
To
the
fullest
extent
permitted
by
applicable
law,
Contractor
shall
insure
and
defend,
indemnify, 
and
hold
harmless
Owner
and
Agent
and
their
respective
officers,
directors,
members,
employees, 
agents,
shareholders,
partners,
joint
venturers,
affiliates,
successors,
and
assigns
from
and
against 
any
and
all
liabilities,
obligations,
claims,
demands,
causes
of
action,
losses,
expenses,
damages, 
fines,
judgments,
settlements,
and
penalties
including,
without
limitation
and
without
regard
to 
the
cause
or
causes
thereof
….
[
Emphasis
added.] 
15In
addition,
some
certificate
requestors
may
demand
that
statements
be
added
to
certificates
or
other 
documents
stating
that
the
insurance
provided
satisfies
the
indemnification
provision(s)
in
the
contract. 
The
problem
is,
no
insurance
policy
exists
in
the
marketplace
that,
as
the
excerpt
cited
above
calls
for, 
insures
“any
and
all”
forms
of
liability
“without
limitation”
and
“without
regard
to
the
cause
or
causes 
thereof.”
To
do
so
would
require
a
policy
with
a
virtually
unlimited
insuring
agreement,
no
coverage 
limits,
and
no
exclusions. 
Why
Risk
Is
Transferred
Downstream
The
COI
journey
most
often
begins
when
two
or
more
parties
enter
into
a
contractual
relationship.
This 
might
be
a
project
owner
and
general
contractor
or
the
general
contractor
and
subcontractors
in
the 
construction
industry.
In
the
real
estate
industry,
the
most
common
contract
is
a
lease.
In
the
banking 
industry,
property
purchases
often
involve
loan
agreements.
In
each
case,
in
order
to
minimize
their 
liability
and/or
the
capital
asset
at
stake,
the
upstream
party
(e.g.,
general
contractor,
landlord,
bank)
will 
want
to
transfer
as
much
of
their
risk
of
loss
as
possible
to
the
downstream
party
(e.g.,
subcontractor, 
tenant,
borrower). 
A
consensus
exists
that
risk
should
be
transferred
to
the
party
best
capable
of
controlling
and/or
financing 
it.
That
is
most
often
the
downstream
party.
Another
reason
is
that
the
indemnitee,
which
is
usually
the 
upstream
party,
is
most
often
in
a
superior
bargaining
position.
An
exception
might
be
when
a
local 
landlord
leases
property
to
a
large
national
corporation
or
a
specialty
subcontractor
that
has
limited 
competition,
which
gives
it
a
stronger
point
of
negotiation. 
Still
another
reason
is
that
the
agent/broker
or
insurer
of
the
upstream
party
is
only
willing
to
provide
a 
superior
(in
coverage
and/or
cost)
insurance
package
if
that
entity
is
able
to
transfer
risk
downstream
in 
order
to
minimize
the
impact
of
claims
on
its
own
insurance. 
The
contract
between
the
parties
will
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
this
risk
transfer.
Again,
an 
agreement
to
indemnify
is
usually
included,
usually
without
limit
and
without
regard
to
cause,
and
there 
will
almost
always
be
at
least
minimal
insurance
requirements.
There
may
be
other
contract
provisions 
that
govern
the
parties’
responsibilities
and
liabilities,
such
as
damage
and
destruction
(D&D)
clauses
in 
leases.
13 
Let’s
review
how
transferring
risk
downstream
can
minimize
liability
for
the
upstream
party. 
Types
of
Indemnification
Indemnification
provisions
are
usually
classed
in
one
of
three
categories. 
•
Broad
form.
An
indemnitor
(e.g.,
sub)
assumes
liability
for
an
indemnitee’s
(e.g.,
general 
contractor’s)
sole
negligence.
The
transfer
of
sole
negligence
may
be
prohibited
or
limited
by 
anti-indemnity
laws,
and
such
restrictions
may
extend
to
the
indemnitee’s
status
as
an
additional 
insured
(AI).
•
Intermediate
form.
An
indemnitor
(e.g.,
sub)
assumes
liability
for
an
indemnitee’s
(e.g.,
general 
contractor’s)
contributory
negligence.
For
example,
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO), 
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
AI
endorsements
are
triggered
only
if
the
insured
indemnitor 
has
some
liability.
In
addition,
some
non-ISO
AI
provisions
only
extend
to
the
indemnitee’s 
vicarious
liability
for
the
insured
indemnitor,
even
though
it
is
the
rare
contract
that
seeks
AI
status 
only
for
vicarious
liability.
•
Limited
form.
An
indemnitor
(e.g.,
sub)
assumes
liability
only
for
its
own
negligence.
Courts
and
legislatures
have
generally
rejected
the
notion
of
broad
form
indemnity
agreements
because 
they
allow
the
upstream
party
to
escape
the
consequences
of
its
own
negligence.
The
result
is
a 
proliferation
of
anti-indemnity
statutes
of
varying
degrees
and
qualifications
and
the
use,
at
best,
of 
intermediate
indemnity
agreements.
As
indicated
above,
similar
restrictions
are
typically
placed
on
AI 
status. 
16Agency
personnel
should
be
wary
of
requirements
that
insurance
meet
contract
indemnity
provisions 
since
no
insurance
policy
provides
indemnification
without
limit
or
cause,
as
is
often
required
in 
indemnity
agreements. 
Outdated
Contract
Language
Contract
drafters
too
often
lack
the
experience
and
understanding
of
the
insurance
industry
that
is 
necessary
to
draft
the
insurance
requirements
of
contracts.
They
may
rely
on
language
from
outdated 
contracts
or
legal
databases.
For
example,
the
following
types
of
insurance
are
still
sometimes
requested, 
despite
not
being
available
by
those
names
for
decades. 
•
Comprehensive
general
liability
insurance
•
Public
liability
insurance
•
Manufacturers
and
contracts
liability
insurance
•
Owners,
landlords,
and
tenants
liability
insurance
•
Broad
form
contractual
liability
insurance
•
Broad
form
property
damage
(BFPD)
endorsement
•
Workers
compensation
“all
states”
endorsement
•
Extended
coverage
endorsement

Examples
of
these
and
other
uninformed
and/or
unreasonable
(or
even
illegal)
requests
are
provided 
elsewhere
in
this
course. 
Determining
an
insured’s
contractual
obligations
for
indemnification
and
insurance
can
be
difficult
for 
many
agents
who
lack
the
training
and
experience
to
review
the
contracts
into
which
their
customers 
enter.
Indemnity
agreements
are
often
uninsurable,
and
insurance
for
some
exposures
may
be
unavailable 
or
unaffordable
from
the
markets
available
to
the
agent.
Contract
terminology
is
sometimes
too
vague, 
general,
or
ambiguous
for
many
agents
to
know
if
the
insurance
program
truly
complies
with
contractual 
insurance
requirements.
This
is
particularly
true
given
that
the
agent
is
not
the
party
who
drafted
the 
contract
language,
yet
the
agent
is
often
expected
to
attest
that
the
insurance
program
provided
is
in 
accordance
with
contract
requirements.
Even
if
the
agent
is
confident
that
this
is
the
case,
they
can
often 
be
second-guessed
by
the
courts. 
In
addition,
what
an
agent
can
legally
do
about
COIs
continues
to
evolve
as
states
pass
or
modify 
legislation,
implement
regulations,
or
issue
updated
regulatory
directives
governing
certificates.
Agents 
are
also
bound
by
the
discretion
afforded
to
them
by
the
insurers
they
represent
as
to
their
authority
to 
issue
certificates,
as
well
as
the
verbiage
they
place
on
them.
In
addition,
Association
for
Cooperative 
Operations
Research
and
Development
(ACORD)
forms
are
copyrighted
and
used
under
license
such
that 
modification
of
any
preprinted
language
on
an
ACORD
form
could
raise
issues
of
federal
copyright
law 
and/or
violations
under
the
licensing
agreement. 
To
further
complicate
matters,
agents
are
often
asked
to
assume
tasks
for
which
they
may
not
be
qualified 
and
are
rarely
compensated.
They
may
be
asked
to
complete
“compliance”
checklists,
issue
“affidavits,” 
or
otherwise
warrant
that
certain
coverages,
conditions,
or
insured
status
are
in
place.
These
legal
and 
business
issues
are
explored
in
the
next
chapter. 
It
is
critical
that
all
parties
involved
in
the
certification
process,
from
agent
and
insurer
to
insured(s)
to 
certificate
holders,
improve
their
understanding
of
each
other’s
needs
and,
just
as
important,
limitations
in 
fulfilling
their
legal
and
business
needs.
To
great
extent,
this
involves
recognizing
and
acquiescing
to 
what
cannot
or
should
not
be
done
and
negotiating
the
most
effective
means
of
accomplishing
what
can 
be
done. 
“Belt
and
Suspenders”
Approach:
Contractual
Liability
Coverage 
versus
AI
Status
17An
agency
customer
service
representative
(CSR)
asks, 
I
have
had
discussions
with
agents
who
believe
that
the
wording
in
the
ISO
CGL
policy
pertaining 
to
an
“insured
contract”
covers
the
requirement
to
add
AI
status
to
a
policy
when
required
in
the 
subcontract
agreement.
They
attach
a
copy
of
that
wording
in
place
of
the
AI
endorsement.
I
feel 
this
is
a
real
stretch. 
Another
agency
CSR
makes
a
similar
inquiry. 
In
the
past,
we
have
not
been
individually
adding
AI
endorsements,
relying
on
them
being
an 
indemnitee
in
the
“insured
contract”
wording
of
the
CGL
or
businessowners
policies,
which
gives 
them
AI
status
without
endorsing
that
on
the
policy.
Our
state
now
has
a
law
that
says
if
we
put
AI 
status
on
the
certificate,
we
must
have
an
AI
endorsement
added
to
the
policy.
Is
this
correct,
or
can 
we
still
rely
on
“indemnitee
in
an
insured
contract”
and
not
go
to
the
trouble
or
expense
of
using
AI 
endorsements? 
Both
of
these
examples
illustrate
that
the
inquirers
(and
apparently
the
entire
agency
in
each
case)
do
not 
understand
the
difference
between
indemnification
and
insurance. 
ISO’s
CGL
policy
has
an
exclusion
for
liability
assumed
under
contract.
A
notable
exception
is
that 
coverage
is
provided
for
liability
assumed
under
an
“insured
contract.”
This
exception
to
the
exclusion 
provides
coverage
if
the
insured’s
breach
of
an
“insured
contract”
causes
bodily
injury
or
property 
damage.
It
does
not
make
the
other
party
to
the
contract
an
insured,
nor
does
it
give
that
party
any
right 
except
as
a
claimant
seeking
indemnity
under
the
terms
of
the
insurance
policy. 
In
the
current
ISO
CGL
policy,
an
“insured
contract”
is
defined
to
include
(1)
leases,
(2)
sidetrack 
agreements,
(3)
easements,
(4)
municipal
indemnity
agreements,
(5)
elevator
maintenance
agreements, 
and
(6)
the
following
catch-all
category. 
That
part
of
any
other
contract
or
agreement
pertaining
to
your
business
(including
an 
indemnification
of
a
municipality
in
connection
with
work
performed
for
a
municipality)
under 
which
you
assume
the
tort
liability
of
another
party
to
pay
for
“bodily
injury”
or
“property
damage” 
to
a
third
person
or
organization.
Tort
liability
means
a
liability
that
would
be
imposed
by
law
in
the 
absence
of
any
contract
or
agreement.... 
So,
the
ISO
CGL
policy
does
provide
some
coverage
for
an
indemnity
agreement
in
a
contract
but
only
if 
it
involves
the
assumption
of
tort
liability
to
pay
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
to
a
third
party, 
and,
of
course,
it’s
subject
to
the
limits,
exclusions,
and
other
terms
of
the
CGL
policy. 
One
problem
with
relying
solely
on
this
contractual
liability
coverage
provision
involves
defense
costs. 
All
insureds
under
the
CGL
have
their
defense
costs
covered
on
an
unlimited
basis
outside
policy
limits. 
However,
under
this
contractual
liability
provision,
the
beneficiary
is
only
an
indemnitee
and
not
an 
insured.
As
outlined
in
the
supplementary
payments
section
of
the
ISO
CGL
policy,
defense
costs
for
the 
indemnitee
are
almost
always
included
within
the
policy
limit.
Since
at
least
the
1996
edition,
the
ISO 
CGL
policy
has
confirmed
this
within
the
contractual
liability
exclusion
language. 
Solely
for
the
purposes
of
liability
assumed
in
an
“insured
contract”,
reasonable
attorney
fees
and 
necessary
litigation
expenses
incurred
by
or
for
a
party
other
than
an
insured
are
deemed
to
be 
damages
because
of
“bodily
injury”
or
“property
damage”....
[
Emphasis
added.] 
In
other
words,
for
indemnitees,
the
policy
limits
apply
to
both
indemnification
and
defense.
Contrast
that 
with
AI
status
where
the
policy
limits
apply
only
to
indemnification,
and
the
AI
has
unlimited
defense 
limits
just
like
any
other
insured. 
When
a
contract
requires
AI
status,
reliance
solely
on
the
contractual
indemnification
coverage
in
the
ISO 
CGL
policy
places
the
insured
in
a
breach
of
contract
position.
The
limited
contractual
liability
coverage 
in
the
CGL
is
insufficient
when
AI
status
is
needed. 
On
the
other
hand,
one
of
the
potential
advantages
of
contractual
liability
coverage
versus
AI
status
is 
that,
unless
prohibited
by
law,
an
indemnitee
is
covered
by
the
CGL
for
its
sole
negligence.
ISO
AI 
endorsements,
as
is
the
case
for
most
AI
forms
in
the
marketplace,
do
not
cover
sole
negligence
of
the
AI.
18Where
possible,
combining
these
two
options
can
be
referred
to
as
a
“belt
and
suspenders”
approach. 
Reviewing
Contracts
for
Insureds
It
is
not
unusual
for
insureds
to
ask
agents
to
review
the
insurance
requirements
in
contracts
such
as
leases 
and
construction
agreements
to
advise
what
types
of
insurance
and
limits
are
needed
to
comply
with
these 
contractual
requirements.
According
to
industry
coverage
expert
Mike
Edwards,
CPCU, 
The
trend
in
risk
management
is
to
try
to
transfer
all
liability
(or
as
much
as
legally
possible), 
whether
insurable
or
not
to
a
downstream
party,
or
at
least
transfer
risk
of
loss
to
the
party
best
able 
to
manage
it.
It
takes
an
astute,
well-trained,
experienced,
and
qualified
individual
to
undertake
the 
scavenger
hunt
often
necessary
to
identify
exposures
in
lengthy
and
complex
contracts. 
Construction
and
service
contracts
can
be
over
200
pages
long.
One
wrap-up
contract
had
51
pages 
devoted
just
to
various
insurance
requirements
of
the
myriad
entities
involved
in
the
project. 
Unfortunately,
many
agencies
lack
the
proper
personnel
to
provide
the
value-added
service
of
contract 
review,
and
undertaking
that
task
without
the
necessary
expertise
may
significantly
enhance
their 
professional
liability
(E&O)
exposure.
Still,
some
agencies
accept
that
as
a
business
risk,
while
others 
invest
in
the
staff
necessary
to
distinguish
themselves
from
their
competitors.
From
an
E&O
standpoint, 
the
best
recommendation
is
for
the
insured
or
prospect
to
have
its
own
legal
counsel
proficient
in
contract 
law
review
these
contracts
and
then
inform
the
agent
what
exposures
need
addressing
from
an
insurance 
standpoint. 
The
reality,
though,
is
that
few
small
businesses
are
going
to
engage
attorneys
to
review
loan
agreements, 
leases,
and
construction
or
service
contracts.
The
most
common-sense
approach,
and
one
that
is 
recommended
by
many
E&O
attorneys,
is
the
middle
ground:
train
your
staff
as
best
as
possible
and 
review
the
contracts
but
with
ample
caveats.
Of
primary
importance
is
to
state
in
writing
that
the
agent
is 
only
reviewing
the
insurance
requirements
of
the
contract
and
is
not
providing
any
legal
advice.
For 
example,
one
agency’s
cover
letter
when
issuing
a
COI
following
a
contract
review
includes
the 
statement,
“This
certificate
of
insurance
represents
coverage
currently
in
effect
and
may
or
may
not
be
in 
compliance
with
any
written
contract.” 
The
following
exhibit
contains
a
sample
disclaimer
letter
that
could
be
used
when
reviewing
contracts
for 
insureds.
This
draft
disclaimer
is
provided
solely
for
illustrative
purposes,
and
the
agency’s
legal
counsel 
should
review
any
disclaimer
actually
used
by
an
agency
before
use
with
an
insured. 
19Sample
Disclaimer
Letter
Our
Agency
has,
upon
your
request,
reviewed
the
contract
indicated
above.
Specifically,
we 
reviewed
only
the
insurance
requirements
contained
in
Section
__,
Page
___.
The
scope
of
our
review
was
to
determine
if
the
current
insurance
program
that
you
have
placed 
through
our
Agency
addresses
the
types
and
amounts
of
insurance
coverage
referenced
by
the 
contract.
We
have
identified
the
significant
insurance
obligations
and
have
attached
a
summary
of 
the
changes
required
in
your
current
insurance
program
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
contract. 
Upon
your
authorization,
we
will
make
the
necessary
changes
in
your
insurance
program.
We
will 
also
be
available
to
discuss
any
insurance
requirements
of
the
contract
with
your
attorney,
if 
desired.
In
performing
this
review,
our

is
not
providing
legal
advice
or
a
legal
opinion
concerning
any 
portion
of
the
contract.
In
addition,
our
Agency
is
not
undertaking
to
identify
all
potential
liabilities 
that
may
arise
under
this
contract.
This

a
recent
case. 
The
agent
insured
several
large
contractors
and
reviewed
contracts
for
these
insureds
on
a
regular
basis. 
In
an
unfortunate
oversight,
the
agent
failed
to
notice
that
a
construction
contract
his
insured
had
signed 
required
CGL
occurrence
limits
of
$20
million.
The
insured
carried
$10
million
limits,
which
had
always 
been
adequate
to
comply
with
any
previous
insurance
requirement.
Two
weeks
after
the
job
started,
the 
risk
manager
for
the
building
owner
called
the
contractor
to
notify
him
that
the
COI
the
agent
had
sent 
showed
inadequate
limits
and
that
work
must
stop
immediately
until
sufficient
limits
could
be
obtained 
and
verified. 
The
contractor
immediately
called
the
agent,
who
was
embarrassed
by
the
mistake.
Later
that
same
day, 
the
agent
was
able
to
obtain
the
additional
$10
million
excess
quote
for
approximately
$8,000
in 
premium.
The
contractor
was
then
angry
that
the
additional
premium
was
essentially
going
to
have
to 
come
out
of
his
profit
on
the
job,
since
he
hadn’t
figured
that
additional
cost
into
his
bid.
He
told
his
agent 
that
he
should
pay
the
additional
premium,
since
it
was
the
agent’s
error. 
The
agent
was
advised
by
an
E&O
attorney
not
to
pay
the
additional
premium
no
matter
how
embarrassed 
he
was
by
the
oversight.
If
the
agent
paid
the
$8,000
additional
premium,
the
attorney
advised
that
it 
might
be
construed
as
admitting
fault,
which
violated
one
of
the
key
provisions
of
his
E&O
policy.

Legal
and
Business
Issues
Overview
A
standard
certificate
of
insurance
(COI)
includes
several
statements
that
serve
as
disclaimers.
These 
statements
make
it
clear
that
the
certificate
provides
only
information
concerning
coverage;
the
certificate 
does
not
provide,
extend,
or
modify
the
provisions
in
the
policy
it
lists.
The
disclaimers
in
a
COI
are 
generally
effective
in
preventing
the
information
contained
in
a
certificate
from
having
a
binding
impact 
on
insurers. 
To
understand
why
certificates
have
so
many
disclaimers,
one
only
must
look
at
errors
and
omissions 
(E&O)
statistics
and
the
proliferation
of
statutes,
regulations,
and
insurance
department
directives
in 
response
to
professional
liability
claims
and
lawsuits.
To
understand
why
agents
sometimes
push
back
on 
what
they
feel
are
unreasonable
certificate-related
requests,
one
must
understand
the
business
risks
and 
costs
of
the
entire
insurance
certification
ecosystem. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
significant
professional
liability
exposures
involved
in
processing
COIs;
•
identify
the
types
of
COI
claims
litigated
and
their
potential
size;
•
identify
the
types
of
laws,
regulations,
and
regulatory
directives
that
may
govern
COIs;
and
•
recognize
the
importance
of
balancing
legal
and
business
decisions
involved
in
processing
COIs.
E&O
Statistics
Twenty
years
ago,
most
E&O
insurers
did
not
break
out
certificate-related
issues
as
a
separate
E&O 
statistical
category.
That
changed
when,
according
to
one
major
E&O
insurer,
about
1
in
10–15
of
all 
commercial
lines
E&O
claims
began
to
involve
COIs
and/or
additional
insured
(AI)
issues.
At
its
peak
in 
some
states,
one-fourth
to
one-third
of
all
commercial
lines
claims
involved
COIs
and
related
issues. 
At
that
point,
the
Independent
Insurance
Agents
and
Brokers
(IIABA),
the
nation’s
largest
trade 
association
of
independent
insurance
agents,
initiated
a
comprehensive
education
program
for
its
member
22agencies.
Its
first
national
webinar
on
this
subject
was
presented
to
about
7,000
participants,
and 
subsequent
educational
programs
continued
to
have
audiences
of
several
hundred
for
each
presentation. 
The
result
of
this
effort
was
a
measurable
reduction
in
the
frequency
of
certificate-related
E&O
claims, 
but
many
of
these
issues
have
resurfaced
in
recent
years,
according
to
anecdotal
information. 
By
line
of
insurance
in
commercial
lines,
for
E&O
claims
involving
certificates
and/or
AIs,
CGL
policies 
account
for
about
60
percent
of
all
claims,
while
workers
compensation
accounts
for
about
15
percent. 
Property
lines
account
for
about
two-thirds
of
all
remaining
claims,
followed
by
auto
insurance. 
By
type
of
error,
about
40
percent
of
certificate
and/or
AI-related
claims
involve
the
failure
to
provide
AI 
or
loss
payee
status
or
having
the
wrong
entity
identified
for
coverage.
About
30
percent
of
claims
allege 
misrepresentation,
most
regarding
statements
made
on
the
COI.
The
remaining
claims
are
attributed
in 
large
part
to
either
a
failure
to
procure
coverage
required
by
contract
or
inaccurate
reporting
of
policy 
status.
The
inaccurate
reporting
of
policy
status
most
commonly
involved,
asserting
that
a
policy
was
in 
force
that
had
actually
terminated;
the
incidence
of
this
type
of
error
appears
to
be
directly
proportional
to 
the
size
of
the
agency. 
If
you
examine
the
source
of
all
E&O
claims
and
not
just
those
involving
COI
and/or
AI
issues,
about
90 
percent
of
claims
come
from
the
named
insured.
In
the
case
of
COI
and/or
AI
claims,
though,
only
about 
60
percent
come
from
the
insured.
An
agent
is
almost
twice
as
likely
to
be
sued
by
an
insurer
for
E&O 
claims
involving
COIs
and/or
AIs.
But
the
big
difference
involves
claims
from
third
parties.
For
all
types 
of
E&O
claims,
only
about
1
claim
in
25
comes
from
third
parties,
but
for
COI
and/or
AI
claims,
that 
number
is
1
in
3. 
In
a
white
paper
published
by
the
IIABA,
four
reasons
were
cited
for
why
COI-related
E&O
claims 
became
so
problematic. 
•
Increased
demand
for
COI
issuance
•
Increased
complexity
of
these
demands
and
the
contracts
on
which
they’re
based
•
Inadequate
staff
qualifications
and
training
of
both
COI
requestors
and
agents
•
Inadequate
procedures
and
quality
control
vigilance
Agents
can
fall
into
a
routine
with
policyholders
that
frequently
require
certificates.
In
these
situations, 
the
agent
may
become
careless
in
checking
to
make
sure
that
the
coverage
hasn’t
changed
or
that
the
limit 
continues
to
be
adequate
for
all
contracts
in
which
the
insured
engages. 
Certificate
Litigation
and
Case
Law
Due
to
the
legal
disclaimers
on
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and
Development 
(ACORD)
forms,
litigation
based
on
erroneous
certificate
information
has
been
largely
unsuccessful 
when
the
lawsuit
has
been
based
on
the
premise
that
the
COI
constituted
a
contract
between
the
certificate 
holder
and
the
insurer
or
agent
of
the
insurer.
The
most
oft-cited
case
supporting
the
premise
that
a
COI 
with
appropriate
disclaimers
does
not
constitute
a
contract
is
U.S.
Pipe
&
Foundry
Co.
v.
U.S.
Fid.
& 
Guar.
Co.
15
).
A
principal
basis
for
this
noncontractual
conclusion
is
that
no
valuable
consideration
has 
been
provided
by
the
certificate
holder
for
the
COI.
Under
English
law,
a
promise
made
without 
consideration
is
generally
not
enforceable,
though
exceptions
are
sometimes
made
under
the
principle
of 
promissory
estoppel,
as
discussed
below. 
Recovery
has
been
more
common
under
fraud
laws
(e.g.,
Binyan
Shel
Chessed,
Inc.
v.
Goldberger
Ins. 
Brokerage,
Inc.
,
16
and
Handley
v.
Providence
Mut.
Fire
Ins.
Co.
17
),
though
some
courts
have
found
for 
certificate
holders
under
the
principle
of
promissory
estoppel
(detrimental
reliance),
especially
where 
disclaimers
are
nonexistent,
lacking,
or
have
been
altered.
Promissory
estoppel
has
been
expressed
as 
follows.
“One
who,
in
the
course
of
his
business,
profession
or
employment,
or
in
any
transaction
in 
which
he
has
a
pecuniary
interest,
supplies
false
information
for
the
guidance
of
others
in
their
business 
transactions,
is
subject
to
liability
for
pecuniary
loss
caused
to
them
by
their
justifiable
reliance
upon
the 
information,
if
he
fails
to
exercise
reasonable
care
of
competence
in
obtaining
or
communicating
the 
information.”
That
being
said,
most
courts
are
believed
to
have
interpreted
ACORD
disclaimers
to
also
23preclude
recovery
on
the
basis
of
detrimental
reliance. 
In
addition
to
claim
frequency
issues,
the
severity
of
COI
claims
can
be
significant,
often
being
six 
figures
and
sometimes
7–8
figures
or
more.
Consider
the
following
examples. 
•
$180,000
missing
AI
endorsement
claim.
Several
anecdotal
studies
were
cited
earlier
that
found 
that
about
40
percent
of
certificates
on
file
that
showed
AI
status
were
incorrect
and
no
such 
coverage
was
actually
provided.
A
common
mistake
made
by
agency
customer
service 
representatives
(CSRs)
is
to
issue
a
certificate
indicating
AI
status
but
then
fail
to
order
the
AI 
endorsement.
In
this
claim,
the
CSR
put
“Certificate
Holder
is
hereby
added
as
an
AI
as
per 
contract”
on
the
COI
but
forgot
to
order
the
endorsement
from
the
insurer.
There
are
also
potential 
problems
with
making
a
statement
like
this
on
a
COI,
as
discussed
elsewhere
in
this
course.
•
$445,000
blanket
AI
endorsement
claim.
Most
“blanket”
or
“automatic”
AI
endorsements
or 
policy
provisions
are
triggered
when
the
insured
enters
into
a
written
contract
that
requires
AI 
status.
In
this
case,
there
was
no
written
contract
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence.
As
a
side 
note,
while
some
proprietary
AI
forms
refer
to
“blanket”
coverage,
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc. 
(ISO),
AI
endorsements
do
not
include
the
word
“blanket”
because
it
can
be
confused
with
the
use 
of
that
common
insurance
term
in
other
ways.
ISO’s
CG
20
38,
CG
20
39,
and
CG
20
40 
endorsements
use
the
word
“automatic”
rather
than
“blanket.”
•
$10,290,000
nonexistent
insurance
policy
claim.
An
employee
leasing
firm
leased
employees
to 
4,000
businesses
while
providing
workers
compensation
coverage
for
the
leased
workers.
The 
workers
comp
policy
nonrenewed,
and
the
leasing
firm’s
agent
could
not
find
another
market.
The 
leasing
firm
found
an
insurer
rated
C–
by
A.M.
Best,
but
the
insurer
wouldn’t
issue
certificates, 
and
the
agency
wouldn’t
do
business
with
any
insurer
rated
less
than
B+.
The
leasing
firm
placed 
business
directly
with
insurer;
the
agent,
as
a
favor
to
his
former
customer,
issued
4,000 
certificates,
not
knowing
that
the
deal
fell
through
and
coverage
was
never
placed.
Catastrophic 
injuries
ensued,
leading
to
a
$20
million
lawsuit
and
an
E&O
claim
against
the
agent
in
excess
of 
$10
million.
•
$150
million
flood
claim?
Following
a
catastrophic
flood,
an
agency
was
sued
for
$150
million 
because
that
amount
of
flood
coverage
was
shown
on
the
COI
despite
the
fact
that
substantially 
less
coverage
was
available
in
a
National
Flood
Insurance
Program
Special
Flood
Hazard
Area, 
which
was
where
the
damage
occurred.
The
claim
is
believed
to
have
been
settled
out
of
court
for 
an
unknown
amount.
As
one
can
see,
the
potential
E&O
claim
size
of
certificate-related
claims
can
be
substantial. 
State
Laws,
Regulations,
and
Directives
Beginning
shortly
after
the
turn
of
the
21st
century,
largely
through
the
local
lobbying
efforts
of
the 
Independent
Insurance
Agents
and
Brokers
of
America
trade
association’s
state
affiliates,
many
states 
began
to
legislate
certificate-specific
laws.
Other
states
chose
to
address
certificate
issues
via
regulation 
or
the
issuance
of
insurance
department
directives.
Currently,
the
only
US
jurisdictions
that
have
not 
specifically
addressed
COI
issues
by
one
of
these
methods
are
Alaska,
Maine,
South
Carolina,
Vermont, 
and
the
District
of
Columbia. 
One
of
the
earliest
states
to
regulate
COIs
was
Alabama.
A
new
regulation
required
that
all
COIs
include 
a
statement
that
certificates
cannot
alter
policy
coverages.
The
law
also
mandated
that
non-ACORD
and 
non-ISO
certificates
must
be
filed
with
the
insurance
department
and
that
“Agent’s
Opinion
Letters”
were 
not
permitted
if
they
could
be
construed
as
a
misrepresentation
of
policy
terms.
A
potential
penalty
of
up 
to
a
$10,000
fine
and
1
year
of
imprisonment
was
introduced
for
each
violation
of
the
law. 
Although
Georgia
codified
its
regulatory
position
later,
it
clarified
the
position
by
issuing
an
insurance 
department
directive
to
all
industry
parties
concerning
what
a
COI
could
and
could
not
do.
Other
states
at 
this
time
legislated
a
solution
statutorily,
such
as
a
Kansas
law
that
mandated
the
filing
and
prior
approval 
of
COIs. 
24It
should
be
noted
that,
while
the
vast
majority
of
all
states
now
specifically
address
COI
issues
by
statute, 
regulation,
or
regulatory
directive,
other
more
general
laws
may
also
apply
to
COI
issues,
such
as
fraud 
and
unfair
trade
practices
laws
and
possibly
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code
(UCC).
For
example,
the 
National
Association
of
Insurance
Commissioners
model
fraud
law
includes
in
the
definition
of 
“fraudulent
insurance
act”
the
“issuance
of
written
evidence
of
insurance,”
and
these
laws
have
been
cited 
in
COI
litigation. 
Use
of
ACORD
forms
is
provided
under
license.
ACORD
forms
are
designed
to
be
completed,
not 
altered.
Copyright
law
18
provides
for
statutory
penalties
ranging
from
$200
to
$150,000
per
violation. 
Agents
may
be
asked
to
issue
ACORD
forms
that
strike
preprinted
disclaimer
or
other
language;
that
may 
possibly
be
a
violation
of
federal
copyright
law,
the
ACORD
licensing
agreement,
the
agency/company 
agreement,
and/or
state
statutes,
regulations,
or
regulatory
directives. 
Some
states
require
non-ACORD
COIs
to
be
filed.
Many
of
these
proprietary
forms
are
essentially 
modified
ACORD
forms.
According
to
ACORD,
with
regard
to
states
that
require
COIs
to
be
filed,
“In 
these
states,
the
text
of
ACORD’s
certificates
cannot
be
modified,
unless
the
modified
form
is
filed
for 
approval
by
the
respective
state
Departments
of
Insurance.”
In
addition
to
that
regulatory
issue,
as 
mentioned
earlier,
ACORD
forms
are
copyrighted,
and
any
modified
use
may
be
subject
to
federal 
copyright
law. 
All
non-ACORD
forms
should
be
referred
to
the
insurer
for
at
least
three
reasons.
First
,
these
forms 
typically
refer
to
the
“issuing
company”
or
“issuing
insurer.”
As
the
agent
of
an
insurer,
unilaterally 
issuing
these
forms
could
result
in
an
E&O
claim
by
the
insurer
against
the
agency
for
overstepping
its 
authority
under
agency
law.
Second
,
nonpermissive
issuance
of
such
certificates
likely
violates
the 
agency/company
agreement
or
supporting
underwriting
requirements.
Third
,
the
agency
exposes
itself
to 
a
heightened
E&O
exposure
to
claims
from
insureds
or
third
parties. 
Agents
may
not
have
permission
to
issue
all
types
of
ACORD
forms.
For
example,
one
insurer’s 
agency/company
agreement
states, 
Your
Business
Authority
and
Commission
Schedule
from
XYZ
Insurance
Company
gives
you
the 
authority
to
issue
standard
and
unaltered
ACORD
Certificates
of
Insurance
for
your
business 
customers.
Only
standard
and
unaltered
ACORD
Forms
24
and
25
may
be
issued. 
Later
in
the
agency/company
agreement,
ACORD
Forms
27
and
28
are
expressly
prohibited
from
being 
issued
without
insurer
permission.
It
is
essential
that
all
agency
staff
members
understand
their
discretion 
under
each
agency/company
agreement,
and
this
information
should
be
kept
up
to
date
and
communicated 
to
all
personnel.
19 
In
the
case
of
excess
and
surplus
markets,
retail
agents
may
not
have
the
authority
to
issue
COIs.
In
such 
cases,
the
agent
must
request
the
COI
from
the
insurer,
managing
general
agent,
or
surplus
lines
broker. 
The
agent’s
authority
should
be
confirmed
in
writing. 
Business
Issues
Perhaps
100
million
certificates
are
issued
annually
in
the
United
States
with
processing
costs
possibly 
exceeding
$1
billion
for
issuing
agencies.
This
number
does
not
include
the
costs
incurred
on
the 
upstream
side
or
monitoring
and
claims
processing
costs
and
litigation.
One
estimate
is
that
the
average 
multiline
agency
issues
30,000
to
40,000
certificates
annually,
the
processing
cost
comprising
at
least
3–5 
percent
of
agency
commercial
lines
revenue.
It
is
not
unusual
for
a
single
contracting
account
to
require 
3,000
to
4,000
certificates
annually. 
One
industry
consultant
has
estimated
that
the
average
automated
ACORD
25
certificate
costs
$7
to
issue. 
One
agency’s
internal
study
indicated
that
the
cost
to
issue
an
ACORD
25
without
addendums
was
$6.71. 
More
complex
requests,
especially
those
that
include
supplemental
questionnaires,
may
cost
25
times
as 
much.
This
does
not
include
time
spent
reviewing
contracts
for
insureds,
communications
between
the 
parties,
or
the
cost
to
reissue
certificates.
Needless
to
say,
the
costs
associated
with
COIs
specifically
and 
contract
compliance
generally
are
significant. 
Unlike
insurers
that
may
increase
premiums
when
expenses
rise,
agents
have
no
way
of
passing
along
25these
costs
to
their
customers.
As
a
result,
some
states
permit
agents,
with
consent
and
full
disclosure
to 
the
insured,
to
charge
fees
for
services
not
contemplated
in
the
commission
received
on
the
account,
just 
as
a
lender
might
charge
for
various
processing
fees.
Or
the
agent
might
(attempt
to)
charge
a
third
party 
for
services
such
as
a
certificate
requestor.
Most
agents
do
not
charge
a
fee
for
issuing
certificates,
but 
some
may
have
a
sliding
scale
based
on
premium
size
where
“X”
number
of
COIs
per
year
are
issued
free 
of
charge
for
the
insured,
and
then
a
per-certificate
fee
is
charged. 
Completion
of
even
the
simplest
ACORD
certificate
has
a
cost
associated
with
it.
Multiply
that
cost
by 
hundreds
or
thousands
of
certificates,
and
it’s
easy
to
see
how
this
process
can
eat
up
the
agency’s 
commission.
For
more
complex
forms
like
the
ACORD
28
or
for
agencies
willing
to
provide
more 
detailed
coverage
information
upon
request,
a
processing
fee
may
be
in
order. 
Lenders,
in
particular,
are
used
to
charging
processing
fees.
The
origination
fee
on
a
real
property
loan 
may
be
$2,000
or
more.
Closing
a
mortgage
may
require
an
appraisal,
title
search,
inspections,
recording 
fees,
credit
checks,
etc.,
all
fees
lenders
are
used
to
paying
third
parties
and
passing
along
to
mortgagers. 
Ongoing
servicing
fees
may
apply
to
loan
advances,
account
statements,
escrow
payments
for
property 
taxes
or
insurance,
and
so
forth. 
In
other
words,
again,
lenders
are
used
to
paying
and
charging
for
processing
fees,
so
certificate
fees
may 
be
charged
by
agencies
if
permitted
by
law.
Agencies
that
don’t
charge
fees
where
otherwise
permissible 
likely
choose
that
route
because
certificate
volumes
are
relatively
small,
customers
are
profitable,
or 
competitive
pressures
suggest
otherwise. 
A
related
but
unresolved
issue
has
to
do
with
whether
charging
a
fee
for
a
certificate
constitutes 
consideration,
thus
giving
credence
to
the
premise
that
the
certificate
constitutes
a
contract.
As
discussed 
earlier,
one
of
the
reasons
a
COI
is
not
considered
a
contract
is
because
the
requestor
pays
no
specific 
consideration
for
the
document.
Paying
a
fee
raises
the
question
of
whether
this
might
make
the
COI
a 
contract. 
If
a
fee
is
not
possible
or
appropriate,
in
some
situations,
the
agency
may
elect
to
discontinue
serving
as 
the
agent
for
a
customer.
One
agency
that
cost-accounted
a
contractor
that
generated
almost
a
fourth
of 
the
agency’s
premium
volume
“fired”
the
customer
because
the
costs
associated
with
the
certificate 
process
exceeded
the
commission
income
generated
by
the
account.
Although
the
customer
reportedly 
offered
to
pay
a
fee
to
remain
with
the
agency,
state
insurance
regulations
did
not
allow
for
such 
compensation. 
As
another
example,
a
North
Carolina
agent
serviced
an
account
generating
about
$1,500
in
annual 
commission
income
but
requiring
the
issuing
(and,
all
too
often,
the
arguing
of
COI
language
with 
requestors)
of
about
400
certificates
a
year.
They
let
the
account
go
because
the
servicing
costs
exceeded 
the
commission
by
a
factor
of
at
least
2–3:1. 
Summary
The
COI
coverages
and
terms
create
a
major
E&O
professional
liability
exposure
for
insurance
agents. 
Over
two-thirds
of
all
such
claims
involve
the
failure
to
provide
requested
AI
or
loss
payee
status
or 
claims
of
misrepresentation
on
COIs.
An
agent
is
about
eight
times
as
likely
to
be
sued
by
someone
other 
than
an
insured
or
insurer
in
certificate-related
claims
than
other
E&O
claims.
The
vast
majority
of
states 
impose
legal
constraints
on
all
parties
involved
in
the
certificate
process
in
addition
to
any
contractual 
constraints
under
an
agency/company
agreement.
However,
if
there
are
no
legal
constraints,
whether
and 
how
a
COI
is
processed
is
largely
a
business
decision
for
an
agency
with
substantial
E&O
limits.

A
Brief
History
of
Nonstandard 
Certificates
of
Insurance
Overview
No
one
seems
to
know
for
sure
when
the
first
formal
certificates
of
insurance
(COIs)
were
issued,
though 
there
is
documentation
that
certificates
were
used
as
early
as
the
mid-1800s
to
evidence
open
cargo 
marine
policies. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
identify
the
types
of
variations
in
COIs
that
occurred
before
industry-standard
forms
were 
introduced;
•
identify
the
role
of
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and
Development
(ACORD) 
in
standardizing
COIs;
and
•
recognize
the
difference
between
ACORD
and
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO),
as
standards 
organizations.
Before
1970
Certificate
forms
were
largely
proprietary
to
each
insurer
until
the
1970s.
Samples
of
such
proprietary 
certificates
include
the
following. 
27Sample
Proprietary
Certificates
1922—Employers
Liability
Insurance
Company
This
“Insurance
Certificate”
was
issued
on
October
7,
1922,
for
“Workmen’s
Compensation 
Insurance”
and
a
“Public
Liability
Policy,”
the
latter
policy
being
an
early
and
much
more
limited 
version
of
what
we
refer
to
today
as
a
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy.
The
indicated
bodily 
injury
limits
on
the
Public
Liability
Policy
were
$5,000/$10,000
per
person/accident.
The
certificate 
stated
that
written
notice
of
policy
“cancellation
or
change”
would
be
provided
to
the
certificate 
holder
without
specifying
the
amount
of
notice
to
be
provided.
The
certificate
contained
no 
disclaimers
of
any
kind.
1930—United
States
Fidelity
and
Guaranty
Company
This
“Certificate
of
Insurance”
was
issued
on
August
23,
1930,
for
“Workmen’s
Compensation
and 
Employer’s
Liability”
and
“Public
Liability.”
The
latter
policy
had
limits
of
$5,000/$10,000
per 
person/accident.
According
to
the
certificate,
“In
the
event
of
any
material
change
in
or
cancellation 
of”
the
policies,
the
insurer
“will
make
every
effort
to
notify”
the
certificate
holder,
but
the
insurer 
“undertakes
no
responsibility
by
reason
of
any
failure
to
do
so.”
The
amount
of
notice
was
not 
specified
(nor
was
it
required
to
be
in
writing),
but
note
that
this
form
did
include
a
disclaimer
with 
regard
to
the
failure
to
notify.
1953—Indemnity
Insurance
Company
of
North
America
This
“Certificate
of
Insurance”
was
issued
on
January
1,
1953,
for
“Blanket
Liability”
involving
a 
sidewalk
elevator,
20
including
contractual
liability,
with
bodily
injury
limits
of
$200,000/$500,000
per 
person/accident
and
a
property
damage
limit
of
$250,000
per
accident.
The
certificate
included
5 
days’
written
notice
of
cancellation
without
a
disclaimer
for
failure
to
notify
within
that
time
frame.
But 
it
did
include
a
disclaimer
that
“Nothing
herein
contained
shall
vary,
alter
or
extend
any
provision
or 
condition
of
the
policy
other
than
as
above
stated
.”
The
“other
than
as
above
stated”
reference 
could,
for
example,
refer
to
all
policy
terms
governing
rights
and
obligations
except
that
the
rights
of 
notice
of
cancellation
are
granted
by
the
certificate
even
if
not
provided
by
the
referenced
policy. 
(More
on
the
“other
than
as
above
stated”
reference
in
the
discussion
to
follow
in
Chapter
6.)
1969—United
States
Fire
Insurance
Company
This
“Certificate
of
Insurance”
was
issued
on
June
13,
1969,
for
“Workmen's
Compensation
and 
Employer’s
Liability”
and
“
Comprehensive
General
Liability
Insurance,”
with
the
latter
policy
likely 
being
an
industry-standard
precursor
to
the
current
CGL
policy
of
ISO.
The
general
liability
policy 
provided
bodily
injury
limits
of
$100,000/$300,000
per
person/occurrence
(note
that
“occurrence” 
had
replaced
“accident”
and
no
aggregate
bodily
injury
limit
was
included)
and
property
damage 
limits
of
$50,000
per
occurrence
and
$100,000
aggregate.
According
to
the
certificate,
the
insurer 
“will
endeavor
to
give
written
notice”
to
the
certificate
holder,
“but
failure
to
give
such
notice
shall 
impose
no
obligation
or
liability
of
any
kind”
on
the
insurer.
The
certificate
itself
required
the
agent
to 
send
the
insurer
a
copy
of
the
certificate
for
each
policy
listed.
This
issue
will
be
discussed
later.
After
1970:
ACORD
Standardization
In
1970,
in
an
attempt
to
standardize
various
proprietary
insurance
processing
forms,
the
Independent 
Insurance
Agents
and
Brokers
of
America
(IIABA),
21
the
country’s
largest
trade
association
of 
independent
insurance
agencies,
along
with
a
consortium
of
insurance
companies,
established
a
nonprofit 
organization
called
“ACORD.”
This
acronym
originally
referred
to
the
organization’s
initial
name,
Agent 
Company
Operations
Research
and
Development.
But
later,
when
ACORD
became
an
independent 
organization,
the
name
was
changed
to
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and 
Development,
retaining
the
“ACORD”
acronym.
Over
time,
ACORD
also
began
developing
electronic 
standards
for
forms
and
processes,
including
XML
data
standards.
Among
its
many
document
standards 
are
several
“certification”
forms,
first
introduced
beginning
in
1976,
that
are
the
subject
of
this
course
and 
discussed
later. 
ACORD
versus
ISO
28Both
ACORD
and
ISO
draft
advisory
insurance
industry
forms.
In
fact,
ISO
has
its
own
line
of
COIs,
first 
introduced
in
2003,
though
they
reportedly
rarely
appear
in
the
marketplace.
The
market
for
standardized 
processing
forms
such
as
COIs
is
dominated
by
ACORD. 
On
the
other
hand,
ISO
dominates
the
marketplace
for
industry-standard
policy
coverage
forms, 
especially
in
commercial
lines.
ISO’s
main
competitor
is
the
American
Association
of
Insurance
Services 
(AAIS),
especially
when
it
comes
to
inland
marine
policy
forms.
The
National
Council
on
Compensation 
Insurance
(NCCI)
publishes
standard
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
forms.
Aside 
from
a
discussion
of
some
AI
issues
when
dealing
with
COIs,
the
focus
of
this
course
is
largely
on 
ACORD
processing
forms
and
ISO
policy
forms. 
For
admitted
insurers,
policy
forms
usually
must
be
at
least
filed
with,
if
not
approved
before
or
after
use 
by,
state
insurance
regulators.
The
same
is
not
always
true
for
COIs,
though
many
states
now
require
the 
filing
of
certificates.
It’s
important
to
note
that
the
fact
that
a
COI
is
filed
does
not
mean
that
it
is 
equivalent
to
a
policy
form;
filing
does
not
make
it
a
policy
form
because
the
COI
does
not
modify
the 
policy
in
any
way.
This
premise
is
supported
by
disclaimers
in
standardized
COIs;
by
state
statutes, 
regulations,
and
department
of
insurance
directives;
and
usually
by
language
in
the
policy
forms 
themselves.
These
topics
are
also
discussed
later
in
this
course. 
Summary
Certificates,
as
addressed
in
this
course,
have
been
around
for
probably
well
over
100
years.
Until
1970, 
there
was
no
uniform
standard,
and
the
terms
of
proprietary
COIs
issued
by
insurers
varied
greatly.
With 
the
formation
of
ACORD
and
the
introduction
of
industry-standard
forms
in
the
1970s,
certificate 
issuance
became
more
efficient
and
consistent.
By
the
end
of
the
1970s,
ACORD
was
the
dominant 
provider
of
standardized
certificates
and
other
processing
forms,
while
ISO
became
the
dominant 
standard
setter
for
policy
forms,
though
ISO
does
offer
its
own
brand
of
certificate
forms.

Types
of
Certificates
Overview
While
standard
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and
Development
(ACORD)
forms
are 
the
most
widely
used
certificates
of
insurance
(COIs)
in
the
industry,
nonstandard
forms
are
also 
available.
The
general
classifications
of
these
forms
are
listed
in
this
chapter.
Specific
issues
with
some
of 
them
are
addressed
in
more
detail
elsewhere
in
this
course. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
the
four
types
of
COIs,
•
identify
the
basic
differences
between
a
COI
and
a
memorandum
of
insurance,
and
•
identify
potential
problems
with
various
online
certification
systems.
Industry
Standard
Certificates
ACORD
forms
are
generally
recognized
as
the
industry
standard
for
“certifying”
insurance
coverages, 
both
property
and
casualty
and
personal
and
commercial
lines.
ACORD
forms
include
several
disclaimers 
making
it
clear
that
the
referenced
policy
forms
are
not
modified
in
any
way
by
the
COI
or
the 
information
on
it.
Courts
have
generally
upheld
these
disclaimers,
with
some
exceptions.
ACORD
forms, 
like
many
prior
proprietary
COIs,
used
to
specify
that
the
insurer
would
“endeavor
to”
provide
notice
of 
cancellation
to
the
certificate
holder,
but
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
A
certificate
holder
is
notified
of 
cancellation,
nonrenewal,
coverage
changes,
etc.,
only
if
such
notice
is
afforded
by
the
referenced
policy 
forms. 
Modified
Standard
Certificates
A
business
partner
may
insist
that
an
agent
issue
a
certificate
that
appears
to
be
an
ACORD
form
but
has 
been
modified
in
some
way.
For
example,
the
1953
COI
discussed
in
Chapter
5
included
a
disclaimer
that 
“Nothing
herein
contained
shall
vary,
alter
or
extend
any
provision
or
condition
of
the
policy
other
than
30as
above
stated
.”
While,
as
is
the
case
with
current
industry-standard
ACORD
forms,
this
COI
appeared 
to
assert
that
it
did
not
modify
the
referenced
policy,
it
implies
that
language
on
the
certificate,
preprinted 
or
added
by
the
completer,
could
modify
the
policy.
The
problem
with
this
language
on
a
COI
is
that
it 
quite
likely
conflicts
with
policy
language
to
the
contrary
and
violates
statutory
or
regulatory
policy
form 
filing
requirements
in
most
states.
There
are
COIs
in
the
marketplace
that
appear
in
every
way
(wording, 
type
style
and
size,
etc.)
to
be
an
ACORD
form
but
may
add
3–4
words
that
serve
to
make
exceptions
to 
the
disclaimers
in
the
ACORD
form.
A
case
in
point
on
this
issue
is
Mountain
Fuel
Supply
v.
Reliance 
Ins.
Co.
22 
Proprietary
Certificates
Some
entities
use
their
own
COIs
that
are
largely
based
on
ACORD
forms
but
may
have
different
(or
no) 
disclaimers;
require
notice
of
cancellation,
nonrenewal,
coverage
changes,
etc.;
or
have
other
verbiage 
that
may
be
problematic.
Aside
from
potential
copyright
issues
with
ACORD,
such
certificates
may
not 
comply
with
various
state
laws
or
regulations
governing
certificates
of
insurance.
Agent
errors
and 
omissions
(E&O)
experts
usually
caution
against
completing
any
proprietary
or
modified
ACORD
forms 
when
possible
and
to
be
wary
of
any
mandated
language
that
is
being
required
on
the
COI
or
a
supporting 
document.
Completion
of
non-ACORD
forms
may
be
prohibited
by
agency/company
agreements
or 
insurer
underwriting
guidelines. 
Manuscript
Certificates
A
manuscript
certificate
is
basically
a
proprietary
form
created
or
modified
for
a
particular
entity.
These 
certificates,
like
manuscripted
policy
forms,
can
potentially
conflict
with
state
laws
or
regulations.
They 
also
require
considerable
experience
and
drafting
skill,
something
that
may
be
lacking
in
the
person 
drafting
the
form.
Needless
to
say,
the
terms
on
a
manuscripted
certificate
are
more
likely
to
benefit
the 
parties
involved
in
the
drafting
of
the
document
than
the
insured,
the
agent,
or
the
insurer. 
Memoranda
of
Insurance
A
memorandum,
as
opposed
to
a
certificate,
of
insurance
might
be
more
akin
to
an
auto
insurance
ID
card 
or
an
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Administration
bulletin
board
notice
than
a
traditional
COI. 
Information
is
usually
very
limited,
nonnegotiable,
not
personalized
with
information
about
the
certificate 
holder,
additional
insureds,
etc.,
and
with
no
options
for
notice
of
changes
such
as
cancellation
and 
nonrenewal.
A
notable
advantage
of
a
memorandum
of
insurance
is
that
it
is
usually
available
online
24/7 
and
can
be
updated
immediately
when
warranted. 
Online
Certification
Systems
Some
entities,
like
government
agencies,
airport
authorities,
lenders,
etc.,
that
deal
with
hundreds
or 
thousands
of
vendors
and
other
parties,
usually
under
contracts
of
various
types,
may
elect
to
outsource 
certificate
production,
verification,
and
tracking.
Because
of
the
complexities
of
such
systems
and
the 
E&O
exposures
they
present
to
agents
and
insurers,
they
are
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
Chapter
10.
Most
standard
ACORD
forms
are
electronically
produced
from
policy
details
maintained
in
agency 
management
systems.
While
far
more
efficient
than
the
paper
forms
of
the
past,
there
are
still
significant 
costs
and
liabilities
associated
with
the
entire
process
that
are
explored
elsewhere
in
this
course.
Also,
be 
aware
that
new
technologies
such
as
blockchain
are
being
explored
as
potentially
providing
far
more 
efficient
and
reliable
means
of
verifying
insurance
coverages. 
Summary
COIs
may
be
industry
standard
forms
such
as
those
from
ACORD
or
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc., 
modified
versions
of
those
forms,
proprietary
forms
drafted
by
certificate
requestors,
or
manuscript
forms 
negotiated
for
each
contract.
An
alternative
to
a
COI
that
may
be
acceptable
to
many
parties
is
a 
memorandum
of
insurance.
The
greatest
flexibility
(and
potentially
danger)
is
often
found
in
online 
certification
systems
that
are
discussed
in
Chapter
10.

This
chapter
briefly
discusses
what
are
arguably
the
five
most
issued
ACORD
forms.
The
Appendix
to 
this
course
includes
copies
of
these
five
forms.
Two
things
found
in
common
among
all
of
these
forms
are 
the
use
of
disclaimers
and
the
absence
of
policy
termination
notice. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
the
importance
of
certificate
disclaimers,
•
identify
the
different
uses
of
the
five
most
common
ACORD
certificate
forms,
and
32•
recognize
the
disclaimer
language
common
to
all
ACORD
certificates.
ACORD
Form
Disclaimers
Disclaimers
are
generally
effective
in
preventing
the
information
contained
in
a
certificate
from
having
a 
binding
impact
on
insurers.
For
example,
in
Taylor
v.
Kinsella
23
,
the
Second
Circuit
noted
that,
“[a]s
a 
general
rule,
where
a
certificate
or
endorsement
states
expressly
that
it
is
subject
to
the
terms
and 
conditions
of
the
policy,
the
language
of
the
policy
controls.” 
This
rule,
the
court
explained,
derived
from
the
principle
that
“the
intent
to
incorporate
additional
papers 
into
an
insurance
policy
must
be
plainly
manifest.”
If
the
certificate
contains
disclaimers,
then
what
is 
“manifest”
is
an
intent
that
the
additional
terms
in
the
certificate
should
not
be
incorporated
into
the 
policy.
Likewise,
in
American
Country
Ins.
Co.
v.
Kraemer
Bros.,
Inc.
24
,
the
court
stated, 
The
presence
or
absence
of
...
a
disclaimer
on
the
certificate
of
insurance
determines
whether
an 
insured
may
rest
its
coverage
case
on
representations
made
in
the
certificate.
If
the
certificate
does 
not
include
a
disclaimer,
the
insured
may
rely
on
representations
made
in
the
certificate....
If
the 
certificate
includes
a
disclaimer,
the
insured
may
not
rely
on
representations
made
in
the
certificate 
but
must
look
to
the
policy
itself
to
determine
the
scope
of
coverage. 
There
are
exceptions
to
this
general
consensus.
Many
of
them
arise
from
modifications
of
the
preprinted 
certificate
information
or
from
statements
added
by
the
agent
on
the
certificate
that
are
deemed,
under 
fundamental
contract
law,
to
supersede
preprinted
boilerplate
language.
In
some
cases,
especially
where 
disclaimers
are
missing
or
modified,
the
principle
of
promissory
estoppel
or
detrimental
reliance,
as 
previously
discussed,
may
apply. 
So,
while
disclaimers
are
usually
upheld
by
the
courts,
the
use
of
modified
or
proprietary
forms
or
the 
inclusion
of
misleading
or
misrepresenting
verbiage
by
the
agent
may
result
in
liability
for
the
agent 
and/or
insurer
beyond
the
terms
of
the
referenced
policy
forms,
as
found
in
Bucon,
Inc.
v.
Pennsylvania 
Mfg.
Ass’n
Ins.
Co.
25
. 
Another
argument
that
a
certificate
holder
may
rely
on
a
certificate
of
insurance
(COI)
is
that
the
Uniform 
Commercial
Code
(UCC),
often
applicable
in
certain
transactions
such
as
the
lease
of
equipment,
may
be 
relevant
when
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
a
certificate
holder’s
reliance
on
certificates
issued
in 
connection
with
transactions
governed
by
the
UCC.
For
example,
UCC
§
1,307
requires
that
“a
… 
certificate
of
insurance
…
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
…
of
the
facts
stated
in
the
document.” 
The
best
argument,
though,
that
a
certificate
cannot
modify
the
terms
of
a
referenced
insurance
policy
is 
the
likely
language
in
the
policy
itself
or
state
statutes
and
regulations
governing
the
filing
of
policy 
forms.
If
a
certificate
purports
to
amend,
extend,
or
alter
policy
terms,
it
is
essentially
an
endorsement.
If 
it’s
an
endorsement,
then
it
must
be
filed
with
the
state
insurance
department
as
a
policy
form
if
issued
on 
behalf
of
an
admitted
insurer. 
In
addition,
many
policy
forms
themselves
assert
that
documents
not
made
a
part
of
the
insurance
contract 
are,
in
fact,
not
part
of
the
policy.
For
example,
the
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.,
commercial
package 
policy’s
IL
00
17—Common
Policy
Conditions
form
says, 
This
policy
contains
all
the
agreements
between
you
and
us
concerning
the
insurance
afforded…. 
This
policy’s
terms
can
be
amended
or
waived
only
by
endorsement
by
us
and
made
a
part
of
the 
policy. 
In
other
words,
only
the
insurer
has
the
authority
to
amend
policy
coverages,
not
the
agent
and
certainly 
not
the
agent
via
issuance
of
a
COI.
The
agent
is
not
a
party
to
the
insurance
contract
and
has
no
such 
authority
to
modify
the
policy.
Policy
forms
of
admitted
insurers
usually
must
be
filed
with
state 
insurance
regulators.
While
certificates
must
be
filed
in
some
states
before
use,
that
does
not
make
them 
part
of
the
insurance
contract. 
ACORD
23—Vehicle
or
Equipment
COI
When
leasing
or
financing
autos
or
mobile
equipment,
the
lessor
or
finance
company
will
usually
require
33documentation
of
coverage
for
physical
damage
and/or
liability
coverage
to
the
vehicle
or
equipment. 
This
form
is
intended
for
use
only
when
the
insurance
policy(ies)
covering
the
subject
vehicle
or 
equipment
grant,
by
endorsement
or
policy
condition,
these
additional
interests
notice
of
policy 
termination. 
The
additional
interest
may
be
an
additional
insured
(AI),
lender’s
loss
payee,
or
loss
payee.
While
the 
use
of
this
form
is
based
on
the
additional
interest
being
entitled
to
notice
of
policy
termination,
such 
notice
is
not
granted
by
the
certificate
but
only
by
the
policy
itself,
as
this
provision
on
the
form
indicates,
SHOULD
ANY
OF
THE
ABOVE
DESCRIBED
POLICIES
BE
CANCELLED
BEFORE
THE 
EXPIRATION
DATE
THEREOF,
NOTICE
WILL
BE
DELIVERED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH 
THE
POLICY
PROVISIONS. 
This
referral
of
the
certificate
holder
to
the
policy
form(s)
for
cancellation
notice
is
found
in
all
ACORD 
certificate
and
evidence
forms. 
The
ACORD
23
is
intended
for
use
only
to
report
coverages
provided
to
a
single
specific
vehicle
or
piece 
of
equipment.
If
a
policy
extends
liability
coverage
to
multiple
vehicles
or
equipment,
the
ACORD
25 
form
should
be
used
to
certify
liability
coverage. 
This
form
includes
two
primary
disclaimers. 
34THIS

THE
ISSUING
INSURER(S),

TO
CERTIFY
THAT
THE

OF
INSURANCE
LISTED

HAS/HAVE
BEEN 
ISSUED
TO
THE
INSURED
NAMED

FOR
THE

INDICATED, 
NOTWITHSTANDING
ANY
REQUIREMENT,

OF
ANY

OR

WITH
RESPECT
TO
WHICH
THIS

OR
MAY
PERTAIN, 
THE
INSURANCE
AFFORDED
BY
THE
POLICY(IES)
DESCRIBED
HEREIN
IS/ARE
SUBJECT
TO
ALL 
THE
TERMS,
EXCLUSIONS
AND
CONDITIONS
OF
SUCH
POLICY(IES).
 
These
disclaimers
appear
virtually
verbatim
in
all
ACORD
certificate
and
evidence
forms.
Together
they 
essentially
say
the
following. 
•
This
certificate
is
informational
only.
•
It
confers
no
rights,
contractual
or
otherwise,
upon
the
certificate
holder.
•
It
does
not
modify
the
referenced
policy
form(s)
in
any
way
nor
extend
coverage
beyond
that 
which
is
provided
by
the
policy
form(s).
•
The
insurance
afforded
by
the
referenced
policy(ies)
is
not
subject
to
any
contractual
or
other 
requirements,
terms,
or
conditions
of
any
document(s)
other
than
the
policy(ies).
In
other
words,
the
issuance
of
this
certificate
should
not
impose
any
obligations
or
liabilities
on
the 
issuer,
insurer,
or
insured
beyond
that
specified
by
the
referenced
insurance
policy(ies). 
ACORD
24—Certificate
of
Property
Insurance
This
form
is
issued
to
an
entity
that
wants
to
verify
that
property
coverage
exists,
but
the
entity
has
no 
direct
interest
in
the
property
itself.
Examples
include
evidence
required
by
condominium
association 
documents
and
lease
agreements. 
If
the
requestor
has
a
verifiable
insurable
interest
in
the
policy
(e.g.,
a
mortgagee,
lienholder,
or
other 
lender),
an
“Evidence
of
Insurance”
form
should
be
used
rather
than
this
certificate.
In
that
case,
the 
appropriate
forms
to
be
issued,
according
to
ACORD,
are
either
the
ACORD
27
for
personal
lines
and 
small
commercial
policies
or
the
ACORD
28
for
commercial
lines
policies
if
the
requestor
requires
more 
detailed
information. 
Which
form
is
issued
may
be
governed
by
an
agency/company
agreement
or
related
underwriting 
guidelines.
Some
insurers,
for
example,
allow
agents
to
issue
ACORD
24
and
25
forms
but
require
them 
to
refer
ACORD
27
and
28
forms
to
the
underwriter.
Such
restrictions
likely
date
back
to
the
day
when 
the
ACORD
27
and
28
included
cancellation
notice
provisions
and
other
verbiage
that
arguably
made 
them
more
legally
actionable
than
is
the
case
today. 
If
the
requestor
of
auto
or
equipment
physical
damage
coverage
information
is
the
owner
of
a
leased 
motor
vehicle
or
a
lender
on
the
subject
vehicle
and
information
is
required
for
both
liability
and
physical 
damage
coverages,
the
ACORD
23
should
be
used. 
Like
the
ACORD
23,
this
form
includes
two
primary
disclaimers
and
a
cancellation
notice
almost 
identical
to
the
ACORD
23.

These
disclaimers
together
essentially
say
the
following. 
•
This
certificate
is
informational
only.
•
It
confers
no
rights,
contractual
or
otherwise,
upon
the

•

nor
extend

beyond
that
which 
is

•
The

afforded
by
the

policies
is
not
subject
to
any
contractual
or
other 
requirements,
terms,
or
conditions
of
any
document(s)
other

shown
on

certificate
are
essentially
those
shown
on
the
policy
declarations
page
and 
may
have
been
reduced
by
paid

In
other
words,
the
issuance
of
this
certificate
should
not
impose
any
obligations
or
liabilities
on
the 
issuer,
insurer,
or
insured
beyond
that
specified
by

insurance
policies. 
ACORD
25—Certificate
of
Liability
Insurance
The
ACORD
25
is
perhaps
the
certificate
most
subject
to
controversy
and
litigation.
The
purpose
of
the 
form
is
to
provide
information
to
the
requestor
regarding
liability
insurance
that
is
in
force
at
the
time
of 
certificate
issuance.
As
the
content
of
the
certificate
implies,
the
ACORD
25
is
used
predominantly
in 
commercial
lines,
especially
in
the
construction
industry
and
lessor/lessee
situations. 
ACORD
has
no
true
certificate
of
liability
insurance
for
personal
lines.
At
one
time,
a
personal
lines 
version
of
the
ACORD
25
was
considered
by
an
ACORD
working
group,
but
no
consensus
could
be 
reached
on
form
or
content.
Given
the
complexities
and
costs
of
administering
certificates
in
commercial 
lines,
especially
the
expertise
required
to
review
the
contracts
that
often
initiate
the
requests
for
insurance 
coverage
information,
the
consensus
was
that
the
use
of
a
personal
lines
certificate
was
impractical, 
enhanced
the
potential
legal
liability
of
agents,
and
was
economically
unfeasible
given
the
narrow 
commission
margins
in
personal

Similar
to
the
ACORD
24,
if
the
requestor
of
auto
or
equipment
liability
coverage
information
is
the 
owner
of
a
leased
motor
vehicle
or
a
lender
on
the
subject
vehicle
and
information
is
required
for
both 
liability
and
physical
damage
coverages,
the
ACORD
23
should
be
used. 
The
ACORD
25
form
includes
the
following
disclaimers
identical
to
those
in
the
ACORD
24
certificate.

AS
A

THIS

BETWEEN 
THE

AND
THE

39THIS
IS
TO

THAT
THE

THE

WILL
BE
DELIVERED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE

PROVISIONS.
 
In
addition
to
the
statements
above,
the
ACORD
25
includes
the
following
cautions
about
AI
status
and 
waivers
of
subrogation. 
IMPORTANT:
If
the
certificate
holder
is
an
ADDITIONAL
INSURED,
the
policy(ies)
must
have 
ADDITIONAL
INSURED
provisions
or
be
endorsed.
If
SUBROGATION
IS
WAIVED,
subject
to 
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
policy,
certain
policies
may
require
an
endorsement.
A
statement
on 
this
certificate
does
not
confer
rights
to
the
certificate
holder
in
lieu
of
such
endorsement(s). 
These
disclaimers
together
essentially
say
the
following. 
•
This
certificate
is
informational
only.
•
It
confers
no
rights,
contractual
or
otherwise,
upon
the
certificate
holder.
•
It
does
not
modify
the
referenced
policy
forms
in
any
way
nor
extend
coverage
beyond
that
which 
is
provided
by
the
policy
forms.
•
The
insurance
afforded
by
the
referenced
policies
is
not
subject
to
any
contractual
or
other 
requirements,
terms,
or
conditions
of
any
document(s)
other
than
the
policies.
•
The
limits
shown
on
the
certificate
are
essentially
those
shown
on
the
policy
declarations
page
and 
may
have
been
reduced
by
paid
claims.
•
AI
status
and
waivers
of
subrogation
are
afforded
only
by
the
specific
terms
and
conditions
of
the 
policy
forms,
not
by
this
certificate.
In
other
words,
the
issuance
of
this
certificate
should
not
impose
any
obligations
or
liabilities
on
the 
issuer,
insurer,
or
insured
beyond
that
specified
by
the
referenced
insurance
policies. 
Because
the
ACORD
25
is
believed
by
many
to
be
the
most
misunderstood
and
litigated
ACORD
form,
it 
will
be
discussed
in
much
greater
depth
later
in
this
course. 
ACORD
27—Evidence
of
Property
Insurance
In
contrast
to
the
ACORD
24,
which
is
issued
to
an
entity
that
wants
to
verify
that
property
coverage 
exists
but
has
no
direct
insurable
interest
in
the
property
itself,
the
ACORD
27,
introduced
in
1993,
is 
used
to
respond
to
requests
from
mortgagees
and
loss
payees
who
are
financing
purchases
of
residential 
property,
personal
property,
or
small
commercial
properties
and
identified
as
such
in
the
property 
insurance
policies.
These
entities
want
to
ensure
that
the
real
or
personal
property
securing
loans
is 
adequately
insured
so
that
the
property
can
be
repaired
or
replaced
if
destroyed. 
These
entities
are
referred
to
as
“additional
interests”
rather
than
“certificate
holders”
because
they
have 
an
insurable
interest
in
the
property.
The
rights
and
obligations
of
these
parties
are
specified
in
the
policy 
forms
under
mortgage
clauses,
loss
payee
endorsements,
AI
provisions,
etc. 
The
ACORD
27
may
also
be
used
as
evidence
of
physical
damage
coverage
for
loss
payees
under
a 
personal
auto
loan.
However,
if
the
requestor
of
auto
or
equipment
physical
damage
coverage
information 
is
the
owner
of
a
leased
motor
vehicle
or
a
lender
on
the
subject
vehicle
and
information
is
required
for 
both
liability
and
physical
damage
coverages,
the
ACORD
23
is
recommended.
40The
ACORD
28
serves
a
similar
purpose
for
larger
or
more
complex
commercial
properties
where
greater 
coverage
detail
is
required.
The
ACORD
27,
unlike
the
ACORD
28,
contains
very
few
specific
preprinted 
information
fields
regarding
the
coverage
provided
by
the
policy
forms,
even
less
than
the
ACORD
24 
COI.
Two
main
fields,
“COVERAGE
INFORMATION”
and
“REMARKS,”
allow
as
little
or
as
much 
information
to
be
included
as
reasonably
needed
to
satisfy
the
additional
interest.
This
provides
for
great 
flexibility,
but
it
also
affords
an
opportunity
for
the
issuer
to
enter
information
that
could
be
construed
as 
misrepresentative
of
the
policy
terms
or
worse.
For
this
reason,
agents
completing
this
form
must
be
very 
careful
in
what
they
say
and
how
they
say
it. 
This
form
includes
the
following
disclaimers,
which
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
disclaimers
in
the 
ACORD
24.

Prior
to
July
2006,
both
the
ACORD
27
and
ACORD
28,
unlike
the
ACORD
24
and
ACORD
25,
were 
believed
by
some
to
convey
certain
rights
to
the
holder,
including
notice
of
cancellation,
according
to 
many
lending
institutions
and
organizations.
However,
the
insurance
industry
largely
argued
that
these 
forms
conveyed
no
additional
rights
under
prior
edition
dates
beyond
those
granted
by
the
referenced 
policy
form(s),
and
the
purpose
of
the
2006
ACORD
revisions
was
to
clarify
this.
For
example,
the
prior 
ACORD
27
disclaimer
said, 
43THIS
IS
EVIDENCE
THAT
INSURANCE
AS
IDENTIFIED
BELOW
HAS
BEEN
ISSUED,
IS
IN
FORCE, 
AND
CONVEYS
ALL
THE
RIGHTS
AND
PRIVILEGES
AFFORDED
UNDER
THE
POLICY.
 
According
to
the
insurance
industry,
even
under
earlier
form
editions,
the
ACORD
27
was
clear
that
it 
only
extended
rights
and
privileges
“afforded
under
the
policy.”
Since
July
2006,
by
explicit
disclaimer 
language,
none
of
these
forms
convey
any
rights
to
the
holder
not
provided
by
the
referenced
policy 
form(s). 
The
current
disclaimers
together
essentially
say
the
following. 
•
This
evidence
of
insurance
form
is
informational
only.
•
It
confers
no
rights,
contractual
or
otherwise,
upon
the
additional
interest
identified
on
the
form.
•
It
does
not
modify
the
referenced
policy
forms
in
any
way
nor
extend
coverage
beyond
that
which 
is
provided
by
the
policy
forms.
•
The
insurance
afforded
by
the
referenced
policies
is
not
subject
to
any
contractual
or
other 
requirements,
terms,
or
conditions
of
any
document(s)
other
than
the
policies.
•
The
limits
shown
on
the
evidence
form
are
essentially
those
shown
on
the
policy
declarations
page 
and
may
have
been
reduced
by
paid
claims.
In
other
words,
the
issuance
of
this
evidence
form
should
not
impose
any
obligations
or
liabilities
on
the 
issuer,
insurer,
or
insured
beyond
that
specified
by
the
referenced
insurance
policies. 
ACORD
28—Evidence
of
Commercial
Property
Insurance
In
contrast
to
the
ACORD
24,
which
is
issued
to
an
entity
that
wants
to
verify
that
property
coverage 
exists
but
has
no
direct
interest
in
the
property
itself,
the
ACORD
28
is
used
to
respond
to
requests
from 
mortgagees
and
loss
payees
who
are
financing
purchases
of
larger
commercial
properties,
both
real
and 
business
personal
property.
The
ACORD
28
was
introduced
in
2004
after
consultation
with
the
Mortgage 
Bankers
Association,
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
(“Fannie
Mae”),
Federal
Home
Loan 
Mortgage
Corporation
(“Freddie
Mac”),
and
other
interested
parties, 
As
with
the
ACORD
27,
these
entities
are
referred
to
as
“additional
interests”
rather
than
“certificate 
holders”
because
they
have
an
insurable
interest
in
the
property.
The
rights
and
obligations
of
these 
parties
are
specified
in
the
policy
forms
under
mortgage
clauses,
loss
payee
endorsements,
AI
provisions, 
etc. 
The
ACORD
27
serves
a
similar
purpose
for
residential
and
smaller
commercial
properties,
but
the 
ACORD
28,
unlike
the
ACORD
27,
contains
extensive
and
very
specific
information
fields
regarding
the 
coverage
provided
by
the
policy
forms. 
This
form
includes
the
following
disclaimers,
which
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
disclaimers
in
the 
ACORD
24. 
44THIS

OF

PROPERTY
INSURANCE

OR

OR

BE
CANCELLED
BEFORE
THE
EXPIRATION 
DATE
THEREOF,
NOTICE
WILL
BE
DELIVERED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
POLICY 
PROVISIONS.
 
These
disclaimers
together
essentially
say
the
following. 
•
This
evidence
of
insurance
form
is
informational
only.
•
It
confers
no
rights,
contractual
or
otherwise,
upon
the
additional
interest
identified
on
the
form.
•
It
does
not
modify
the
referenced
policy
forms
in
any
way
nor
extend
coverage
beyond
that
which 
is
provided
by
the
policy
forms.
•
The
insurance
afforded
by
the
referenced
policies
is
not
subject
to
any
contractual
or
other 
requirements,
terms,
or
conditions
of
any
document(s)
other
than
the
policies.
•
The
limits
shown
on
the
evidence
form
are
essentially
those
shown
on
the
policy
declarations
page 
and
may
have
been
reduced
by
paid
claims.
In
other
words,
the
issuance
of
this
evidence
form
should
not
impose
any
obligations
or
liabilities
on
the 
issuer,
insurer,
or
insured
beyond
that
specified
by
the
referenced
insurance
policies. 
Keep
in
mind
that,
just
as
the
ACORD
25
should
only
include
information
on
liability
coverages,
the 
ACORD
24,
27,
and
28
should
only
include
information
on
property
coverages.
For
example,
an
agency 
customer
service
representative
issued
an
ACORD
27
that
included
information
about
the
insurance
on 
the
building,
equipment
breakdown,
a
fidelity
bond,
directors
and
officers,
commercial
general
liability 
(CGL),
auto,
workers
compensation,
and
umbrella
coverage.
This
might
imply
in
the
mind
of
a
certificate 
holder
that
these
policy
forms
include
first-party
property
coverage. 
Summary
ACORD
offers
about
a
dozen
certificate
forms,
of
which
perhaps
five
are
the
most
commonly
used.
When 
sued
for
alleged
misinformation
on
an
ACORD
COI,
agents
prevail
most
of
the
time
because
(1)
the 
certificate
is
not
a
contract,
and
(2)
courts
usually
uphold
the
disclaimer
language
on
ACORD
forms.
In 
cases
where
the
plaintiff
prevails,
it
is
most
likely
on
the
basis
of
fraud
or,
sometimes,
promissory 
estoppel
(detrimental
reliance),
and,
of
course,
the
agent
may
be
subject
to
regulatory
penalties
under
the 
law,
including
fines
and
incarceration. 
Needless
to
say,
agents
should
never
issue
an
ACORD
form
where
the
disclaimers
have
been
modified
or 
removed,
and
all
non-ACORD
forms
should
be
referred
to
the
insurance
company.

Milestone
Changes
in
the
ACORD
25—Certification
The
original
November
1977
ACORD
25
included
a
“certification”
that
said, 
52This
is
to
certify
that
policies
of
insurance
listed
below
have
been
issued
to
the
insured
named
above 
and
are
in
force
at
this
time.
 
In
January
1979,
a
disclaimer
was
added
to
the
prior

Changes
in
the
ACORD
25—Types
of
Insurance
The
original
November
1977
ACORD
25
included
fields
for
general
liability,
auto
liability,
excess 
liability,
workers
compensation
and
employers’
liability,
and
“other”
types
of
liability
insurance.
Within 
the
general
liability
category,
coverage
could
be
further
delineated
by
whether
the
comprehensive
form 
was
used,
only
premises/operations,
products/completed
operations,
broad
form
property
damage,
and 
other
sublines
available
at
that
time. 
In
November
1985,
following
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO)’s
“Simplification”
project,
which 
completely
overhauled
its
commercial
lines
forms,
rules,
and
rating
methodologies,
the
information
under 
the
general
liability
and
auto
liability
categories
was
revised
to
reflect
changes
such
as
the
name
of
the 
ISO
CGL
policy
from
“Comprehensive
General
Liability”
to
“Commercial
General
Liability”
and
the 
introduction
of
a
claims-made
CGL
policy. 
In
March
1993,
checkboxes
were
added
to
indicate
whether
sole
proprietors,
partners,
or
executive 
officers
were
included
or
excluded
under
the
workers
compensation
policy. 
In
July
1997,
checkboxes
were
added
to
indicate
aggregate
limits
for
the
entire
policy
or
per
project
or 
location.
Boxes
were
added
in
the
excess
liability
section
to
indicate
occurrence
versus
claims-made 
forms
and
the
existence
of
a
deductible
or
self-insured
retention
limit.
The
checkboxes
for
workers 
compensation
inclusion/exclusion
for
proprietors,
partners,
and
executive
officers
were
(perhaps 
inadvertently)
removed. 
In
August
2001,
the
question
of
whether
a
proprietor,
partner,
or
executive
officer
was
covered
for 
workers
compensation
was
reinstated
with
directions
to
reply
in
the
SPECIAL
PROVISIONS
section
of 
the
“Description
of
Operations”
field. 
In
September
2009,
columns
were
added
to
indicate
AI
and
subrogation
waivers
for
each
relevant
type
of 
insurance
listed. 
Milestone
Changes
in
the
ACORD
25—Description
of
Operations
The
original
November
1977
ACORD
25
included
a
relatively
small
area
on
the
form
for 
“DESCRIPTION
OF
OPERATIONS/LOCATIONS/VEHICLES.
” 
In
February
1984,
the
prior
description
of
this
field
was
expanded
to
say,
“DESCRIPTION
OF 
OPERATIONS/LOCATIONS/VEHICLES/
SPECIAL
ITEMS.”
This
was
to
allow
additional
explanatory 
information
that
might
be
requested. 
In
November
1985,
the
word
“RESTRICTIONS”
was
added
to
update
the
title
of
this
field
to 
“DESCRIPTION
OF
OPERATIONS/LOCATIONS/VEHICLES/
RESTRICTIONS/SPECIAL
ITEMS.” 
In
November
1989,
the
“RESTRICTIONS”
wording
was
removed,
reverting
the
title
of
this
field
back
to 
its
name
in
1984. 
In
July
1997,
the
prior
“RESTRICTIONS”
language
was
effectively
restored
by
allowing
for
the 
indication
of
exclusionary
endorsements:
“DESCRIPTION
OF 
OPERATIONS/LOCATIONS/VEHICLES/
EXCLUSIONS
ADDED
BY
ENDORSEMENT/SPECIAL 
PROVISIONS.” 
In
September
2009,
references
to
exclusionary
endorsements
and
special
provisions
were
removed
so
that 
the
field
title
reverted
to
the
original
November
1977
form
language,
though
an
allowance
was
made
to
58attach
an
ACORD
101
form
to
provide
any
additional
requested
information
agreed
to
by
the
parties.
This 
field
was
retitled
“DESCRIPTION
OF
OPERATIONS/LOCATIONS/VEHICLES
(Attach
ACORD
1010, 
Additional
Remarks
Schedule,
if
more
space
is
required)”. 
Milestone
Changes
in
the
ACORD
25—Notice
of
Cancellation
The
original
November
1977
ACORD
25
provided
for
notice
of
cancellation
by
stating, 
59Should
any
of
the
above
described
policies
be
cancelled
before
the
expiration
date
thereof,
the
issuing 
company
will
endeavor
to
mail
_____
days
written
notice
to
the
below
named
certificate
holder,
but 
failure
to
mail
such
notice
shall
impose
no
obligation
or
liability
of
any
kind
upon
the
company.
 
As
we
saw
in
a
prior
discussion,
as
early
as
1922,
certificates
indicated
that
cancellation
notice
would
be 
provided.
But,
as
the
sheer
number
of
requests
for
coverage
certification
exploded
in
the
1980s,
the
ability 
to
provide
such
notice
became
an
activity
insurers
no
longer
wanted
to
assume.
As
a
matter
of
ethics,
if 
not
practicality,
the
reality
was
that
increasingly
few
insurers
“endeavored
to”
provide
notice
of 
cancellation,
and
it
was
felt
that
this
language
was
inappropriate
and
possibly
misrepresentative. 
This
language
was
slightly
revised
in
February
1984
for
cosmetic
changes
in
the
form
(e.g.,
referring
to 
the
certificate
holder
on
the
“left”
rather
than
“below”)
and
the
disclaimer
was
extended
to
agents
and 
representatives
of
the
insurance
company.
In
addition,
to
make
the
disclaimer
more
prominent,
it
was 
printed
in
all
caps. 
60SHOULD
ANY
OF
THE
ABOVE
DESCRIBED
POLICIES
BE
CANCELLED
BEFORE
THE
EXPIRATION 
DATE
THEREOF,
THE
ISSUING
COMPANY
WILL
ENDEAVOR
TO
MAIL
_____

NOTICE
TO
THE
CERTIFICATE
HOLDER
NAMED

MAIL
SUCH 
NOTICE
SHALL
IMPOSE
NO
OBLIGATION
OR
LIABILITY
OF
ANY
KIND
UPON
THE
COMPANY,
ITS 
AGENTS
OR
REPRESENTATIVES.
 
In
September
2009,
the
cancellation
provision
on
the
ACORD
25
was
effectively
removed,
and
the 
certificate
holder
was
referred
to
the
policy
forms
for
its
rights,
if
any,
regarding
notice
of
policy 
termination.
The
new
statement
said
(and
continues
to
say), 
61SHOULD
ANY
OF
THE
ABOVE
DESCRIBED
POLICIES
BE
CANCELLED
BEFORE
THE
EXPIRATION 
DATE
THEREOF,
NOTICE
WILL
BE
DELIVERED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
POLICY 
PROVISIONS.
 
The
industry
argument
for
this
practice,
beyond
the
issue
of
practicality,
was
that
cancellation
involves 
the
dissolution
of
a
contract,
and
only
parties
that
have
a
contractual
right
of
cancellation
notice,
such
as 
named
insureds
(first
named
insureds
in
the
case
of
many
commercial
policy
forms),
mortgagees,
and
loss 
payees
should
be
afforded
this
contractual
privilege. 
A
related
issue
was
that,
in
the
absence
of
insurers
providing
cancellation
notice
to
certificate
holders, 
many
agents
would
voluntarily
undertake
this
responsibility
despite
the
COI’s
statement
that
“the
issuing 
company”
(not
the
agent)
would
endeavor
to
provide
notice.
Errors
and
omissions
(E&O)
insurance 
providers
universally
recommended
that
agents
not
provide
notice
of
cancellation
since
that
is
a 
contractual
right
between
the
parties
to
the
contract,
the
insured
and
insurer,
not
the
agent. 
Finally,
for
decades,
it
was
a
common
practice
for
agents
to
provide
copies
of
all
issued
COIs
to
the 
referenced
insurer(s).
Once
the
notice
of
cancellation
provision
on
ACORD
certificates
was
removed, 
leaving
only
a
reference
to
cancellation
rights
under
the
referenced
policy(ies),
many
insurers
felt
there 
was
no
longer
a
need
to
receive
copies
of
COIs.
However,
E&O
insurers
still
recommend
that
this 
practice
be
continued
by
agents,
and
the
rationale
for
this
is
discussed
later
in
this
course.

Added
and
Deleted
In
July
1997,
a
box
was
added
above
the
certificate

field
to
indicate
AI

A
second
page
was 
added
to
the
ACORD
25
that
included
an
“IMPORTANT”

regarding
AI

as

In
September
2009,
the
AI
box
on
the
first
page
of
the
ACORD
25
was
deleted,
and
the
second
page
was 
also
removed
and
the
information
on
that
page
incorporated
into
various
sections
of
the
first
page
of
the 
form,
as
outlined
above.
The
reason
for
this
was
alleged
to
be
that
the
second
page
of
the
form
was
often 
omitted
in
error,
resulting
in
a
lack
of
important
disclaimer
language. 
Summary
Between
1977
and
2009,
ACORD
25
disclaimers
were
broadened
to
assert
that
the
certificate
was
not
a 
contract
and
that
AI
status
and
subrogation
waiver
were
not
extended
by
issuance
of
the
COI
alone
and 
might
require
endorsement.
Similarly,
the
“certification”
statement
was
expanded
to
reiterate
that
the 
information
on
the
form
was
subject
to
the
terms,
exclusions,
and
conditions
of
the
referenced
policies 
and
that
aggregate
limits
could
have
been
reduced
by
paid
claims.
During
that
time,
various
information 
changes
were
made
regarding
the
types
of
insurance
provided.
In
the
cancellation
field,
the
most 
important
change
was
made
in
2009,
when
any
notice
of
cancellation
was
subject
to
that
provided
by
the 
policy,
not
the
certificate.

ACORD
25
Issues
Overview
Given
that
probably
more
questions
arise
from
the
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and 
Development
(ACORD)
25
than
any
other
ACORD
form,
the
following
is
a
discussion
of
issues 
involving
the
major
sections
of
the
form.
In
many
cases,
routine
questions
about
what
should
be
entered 
in
a
particular
field
can
be
answered
by
consulting
the
ACORD
Forms
Instruction
Guide
(FIG)
for
that 
ACORD
form.
Therefore,
this
section
leads
off
with
a
discussion
of
the
FIG
and
then
addresses
specific 
issues
that
often
arise
regarding
various
fields
on
the
ACORD
25.
In
the
subsequent
section,
more
general 
certificate
issues
will
be
covered. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
the
importance
and
value
of
the
ACORD
FIG;
•
identify
potential
problems
with
the
information
provided
regarding
additional
insured
(AI)
status;
•
recognize
that
waivers
of
subrogation
may
require
an
endorsement;
•
recognize
the
importance
of
showing
policy
limits
on
the
certificate,
even
if
greater
than
any 
minimum
limits
provided
by
a
contract
between
the
insured
and
certificate
holder
or
others;
•
recognize,
in
a
broad
sense,
what
verbiage
should
or
should
not
be
included
in
the
Description
of 
Operations
field
and
why;
and
•
recognize
that
notice
of
cancellation
is
a
right
that
can
only
be
granted
by
the
insurance
contract, 
not
a
certificate
of
insurance
(COI).
ACORD
FIG
At
one
time,
ACORD
published
a
very
large
document
that
included
instructions
for
every
ACORD
form. 
Referred
to
as
the
“FIG”
(Forms
Instruction
Guide),
its
biggest
deficiency
was
that,
any
time
a
single 
ACORD
form
was
modified,
the
entire
FIG
had
to
be
revised.
As
a
result,
ACORD
began
to
publish
a 
separate
FIG
for
each
ACORD
form.
These
FIGs
are
available,
along
with
sample
forms,
free
of
charge
64from
ACORD,
though
one
must
be
a
subscriber
to
access
them. 
Many
agent
errors
and
omissions
(E&O)
experts
recommend
that
ACORD’s
FIGs
be
included
in
the 
agency’s
written
procedures
manual,
if
only
by
reference,
to
improve
consistency
in
the
issuance
of 
ACORD
forms.
Another
value
is
that,
if
a
certificate
requestor
asks
an
agent
to
place
certain
information 
in
a
particular
field,
the
agent
can
point
to
the
FIG
and
the
agency’s
procedures
manual
as
the
basis
for 
declining
such
requests
if
the
agency
deems
it
inappropriate. 
As
noted
earlier
and
below,
ACORD
certificates
include
several
disclaimers.
That
is
also
true
of 
ACORD’s
FIGs.
An
example
follows. 
Agents
or
brokers
should
not
change
any
provision
on
this
form
without
prior
consent
of
the
issuing 
company.
The
ACORD
Certificate
should
be
issued
only
in
compliance
with
company
instructions. 
ACORD
recommends
that
the
Certificate
NOT
be
used
in
the
following
situations: 
◦
To
waive
rights
◦
To
quote
wording
from
a
contract
(some
state
laws
prohibit
as
well)
◦
To
attach
to
an
endorsement
(but
sending
an
endorsement
is
OK)
◦
To
quote
any
wording
which
amends
a
policy
unless
the
policy
itself
has
been
amended
These
instructions
apply
to
both
admitted
and
nonadmitted
insurers.
Agents
often
have
far
less,
if
any, 
authority
to
issue
certificates
on
behalf
of
a
surplus
lines
insurer
or
its
excess
and
surplus
broker. 
Often,
certificate
requestors
will
provide
a
sample
ACORD
25
form
that
indicates
how
they
want
the 
form
to
be
completed.
It
is
recommended
that
the
sample
form
be
reviewed
very
carefully
so
that
it 
follows,
as
closely
as
possible,
the
FIG
for
this
form
and
that
the
potential
liability
caveats
discussed
in 
this
course
are
carefully
considered. 
With
these
caveats
in
mind,
specific
ACORD
25
entry
fields
are
addressed
in
the
following
discussion. 
Types
of
Insurance
Once
again,
the
ACORD
25
is
used
to
certify
liability
coverages
only,
not
property,
inland
marine,
etc.
It 
is
not
unusual
to
see
an
ACORD
25
issued
on
behalf
of
a
contractor
that
includes
a
builders
risk 
installation
floater
and
an
inland
marine
equipment
policy,
implying
that
these
provide
liability
coverage. 
It’s
clearly
less
work
to
place
all
contractually
required
insurance
on
one
certificate,
but
that’s
not
what 
these
standardized
forms
are
designed
to
do. 
Types
of
Insurance—Automobile
Liability
Be
wary
of
sample
ACORD
forms
that
improperly
indicate
how
to
complete
this
field.
Most
likely,
the 
requestor
has
not
reviewed
the
FIG
for
this
form
and,
as
a
result,
in
the
case
of
auto
liability
coverage 
being
required
for
owned,
hired,
and
nonowned
autos,
their
sample
form
shows
checkmarks
for 
something
like
“Any
Auto,”
“Owned
Autos
Only,”
“Hired
Autos
Only,”
and
“Non-Owned
Autos
Only.” 
If
liability
coverage
is
provided
in
accordance
with
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO),
rules
by
symbol 
1,
only
the
“Any
Auto”
checkbox
needs
to
be
completed. 
Types
of
Insurance—AI
Column
The
first
point
to
be
made
here
is
represented
by
the
second
disclaimer
on
the
ACORD
25: 
“IMPORTANT:
If
the
certificate
holder
is
an
ADDITIONAL
INSURED,
the
policy(ies)
must
have 
ADDITIONAL
INSURED
provisions
or
be
endorsed.”
As
suggested
below
and
later
in
this
course,
it
is 
often
a
good
idea
to
provide
a
copy
of
the
actual
AI
endorsement
to
the
AI. 
Given
the
number
of
E&O
claims
and
lawsuits
involving
AIs,
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
fields
on 
the
ACORD
25.
It
is
common
for
ACORD
25
requestors
to
insist
on
more
than
just
a
checkmark
to
65indicate
AI
status.
Requestors
may
want
the
names
of
specific
entities
and
a
declarative
statement
that 
such
entities
are
AIs,
along
with
other
verbiage
that
may
be
inappropriate. 
For
example,
the
requestor
may
want
the
certificate
to
state
verbatim
that
“XYZ
and
its
[insert
various 
entities
here
such
as
officers,
employees,
agents,
etc.]
are
additional
insureds
as
per
construction 
contract
.”
The
contract
that
governs
AI
status
is
the
insurance
contract,
not
the
construction
contract. 
While
it’s
best,
from
an
agent
E&O
standpoint,
to
not
include
any
explanatory
verbiage
regarding
AI 
status,
if
the
agent
decides
to
do
so,
superior
phrasing
in
this
example
would
likely
be
something
like
“as 
per
insurance
contract”
rather
than
“as
per
construction
contract.”
Then
include
a
copy
of
the
AI 
endorsement
or
policy
provision.
The
reason
for
this
is
discussed
later
in
this
course. 
Sometimes
AI
certificate
verbiage
exceeds
what
the
underwriter
is
willing
to
permit.
For
example, 
consider
the
following
language
that
was
requested
to
appear
verbatim
on
an
ACORD
25. 
XYZ
Catering,
Inc.
(d/b/a
XYZ
Creations),
ABC
Sports
&
Entertainment
LLC,
ABC
Holdings
LP, 
the
DEF
Center,
their
respective
principals,
members,
officials,
officers,
directors,
shareholders, 
employees,
and
agents,
their
respective
parent
and
affiliate
companies
and
their
respective 
Successors
or
Assigns
as
now
or
hereafter
may
be
constituted
and
the
Centennial
Authority,
the
City 
of
Raleigh,
North
Carolina,
the
State
of
North
Carolina
and
their
departments,
divisions, 
commissions,
and
boards
and
their
respective
principals,
members,
officials,
officers,
directors, 
shareholders,
employees,
and
agents
have
been
named
as
additionally
insureds
under
said
policy 
with
respect
to
any
legal
liability
arising
out
of
the
Licensee’s
performance
hereunder. 
This
language
would
appear
to
include
as
AIs
everyone
in
the
state
of
North
Carolina.
The
contract
in 
question
was
identical
for
all
vendors
at
a
convention
center
event,
in
this
case
for
a
hot
dog
vendor
with
a 
pushcart. 
Again,
be
wary
of
elaborating
about
AI
coverage.
While
ISO
AI
endorsement
language
dominates
the 
marketplace,
many
insurers
use
proprietary
forms
or
modify
ISO
forms.
For
example,
as
discussed
earlier, 
most
contracts
calling
for
AI
status
presume
that
such
coverage
is
provided
for
the
direct
liability
of
the 
AI,
although
many
non-ISO
AI
forms
extend
only
vicarious
liability,
and
that
fact
is
not
always
obvious 
from
a
cursory
reading
of
the
form.
The
problem
is
that
many
of
these
forms
don’t
use
the
wording 
“vicarious
liability.”
For
example,
consider
the
following
four
non-ISO
AI
endorsements. 
•
Coverage
is
provided
“…
only
to
the
extent
that
‘additional
insured’
is
being
held
responsible
for 
the
acts,
omissions
and/or
negligence
of
the
‘named
insured.’”
•
“The
person
or
organization
does
not
qualify
as
an
additional
insured
with
respect
to
the 
independent
acts
or
omissions
of
such
person
or
organization.”
•
“The
coverage
afforded
hereunder
is
limited
to
imputed
liability
resulting
solely
from
the
conduct 
of
the
named
insured
for
which
the
additional
insured
is
held
responsible
and
liable.”
•
“The
coverage
afforded
to
the
additional
insured
is
limited
solely
to
the
additional
insured’s 
‘vicarious
liability’
that
is
a
specific
and
direct
result
of
your
conduct.”
Note
that
all
of
these
forms
extend
AI
status
only
for
the
AI’s
vicarious
liability,
though
only
one
of
the 
forms
uses
that
language.
The
use
of
such
forms
might
place
the
insured
in
breach
of
contract,
but
how 
many
agents
would
be
aware
of
the
limitations
in
such
endorsements? 
Other
AI
endorsements
include
exclusions
for
certain
liabilities—for
example,
claims
based
on
negligent 
supervision.
Some
only
provide
excess
coverage
over
the
insured’s
policy,
not
the
primary
and 
noncontributory
coverage
universally
requested
in
contracts.
Others
may
include
defense
within
limits. 
Automatic
or
“blanket”
AI
endorsements
typically
are
triggered
only
by
written
contracts
with
the
proper 
wording. 
The
bottom
line
is,
if
an
Additional
Insured
field
is
checked
on
the
ACORD
25,
what
does
that
tell
you 
about
AI
status?
Not
much.
The
only
way
to
know
with
reasonable
reliability
whether
an
entity
is
an
AI
is 
to
review
the
policy
language
to
see
if
it
complies
with
the
insurance
requirements
in
the
contract
between 
the
insured
and
certificate
holder.
66Types
of
Insurance—Subrogation
Waivers
Column
Sometimes
an
insurer
will
pay
a
claim
or
suit
against
an
insured,
though
another
party
is
legally
at
fault. 
Many
policies
grant
the
insurer
a
right
of
subrogation
against
another
negligent
party
to
recover
what
was 
paid
under
a
policy
on
behalf
of
an
insured.
To
avoid
the
possibility
of
subrogation
claims
from
a 
downstream
party,
the
contract
may
require
that
the
downstream
party’s
policy
include
a
waiver
of 
subrogation.
Although
some
contracts,
especially
leases,
include
a
mutual
waiver
of
subrogation, 
one-sided
waivers
are
more
common
when
the
subject
policy
is
general
liability,
auto,
or
workers 
compensation. 
As
for
AI
status,
the
ACORD
25
includes
a
disclaimer
that
advises
that
certain
policies
may
require
an 
endorsement
to
waive
subrogation.
ISO
CGL,
business
auto,
and
commercial
property
coverage
forms 
grant
waivers
of
subrogation
if
done
prior
to
loss.
In
the
case
of
commercial
property,
such
waiver
must 
be
in
writing.
A
workers
compensation
policy
in
most
states,
under
National
Council
on
Compensation 
Insurance
rules,
requires
that
subrogation
be
waived
by
endorsement,
and
optional
endorsements
also 
exist
in
ISO’s
CGL
and
business
auto
programs. 
It
is
generally
accepted
that
insurers
cannot
subrogate
against
their
own
insureds
except
in
rare
instances 
like
intentional
losses.
Thus,
AI
status
possibly
grants
some
degree
of
protection
from
subrogation
after 
loss.
However,
to
fully
comply
with
some
contractual
requirements,
a
specific
waiver
is
recommended.
In 
addition,
AI
status
doesn’t
necessarily
preclude
subrogation
against
the
AI
such
that
a
specific
waiver
of 
subrogation
is
not
needed.
The
waiver
prohibits
a
broader
right
of
recovery.
There
may
be
no
coverage 
for
the
AI
under
the
AI
endorsement
for
the
type
of
claim
(e.g.,
completed
versus
ongoing
operations), 
and
a
loss
may
exceed
the
limits
available
to
the
AI. 
Finally,
be
sure
to
follow
any
state
laws
dealing
with
subrogation
that
may
call
for
attachment
of
an 
endorsement. 
Limits—General
Comments
First,
note
that
the
ACORD
25
includes
a
disclaimer
that
limits,
especially
aggregate
limits,
may
have 
been
reduced
by
paid
claims.
The
agent
may
not
be
aware
of
this.
Second,
avoid
adding
any
language
on 
the
certificate
related
to
limits.
The
following
is
an
example
of
an
actual
statement
required
to
be
added
to 
an
ACORD
25
that
was
impractical
and
likely
impossible. 
 
For
those
policies
containing
an
aggregate,
as
soon
as
loss
activity
(paid
or
reserved
)
depletes
the 
aggregate
by
50%
or
more,
written
notice
must
be
sent
to
the
Contractor
by
certified
mail.
[ 
Emphasis
added.] 
Agents
are
best
advised
to
be
vigilant
about
mandates
like
this
and
others
discussed
in
this
course. 
Limits—Certificate
versus
Policy
Limits
Perhaps
the
most
common
question
about
certificate
limits
is
whether
the
entire
limit
available
on
a
policy 
must
be
shown
on
the
certificate
if
the
insurance
requirements
in
the
contract
into
which
the
insured
has 
entered
are
less
than
that
amount.
For
example,
an
insured
contractor
has
gotten
a
job
where
the
insurance 
requirements
include
“not
less
than”
$1
million
in
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
coverage.
Your 
insured
has
a
$2
million
CGL
occurrence
limit.
He
doesn’t
want
the
other
party
to
know
how
much 
insurance
he
has,
so
he
asks
you
to
issue
the
certificate
showing
a
$1
million
limit,
the
minimum
required 
by
the
contract.
So,
what
do
you
show
on
the
certificate,
$1
million
or
$2
million? 
The
ACORD
FIG
says, 
Enter
limits
corresponding
to
those
found
on
the
policy
declarations
page. 
Therefore,
the
intent
of
the
ACORD
certificate
is
obviously
to
show
the
actual
policy
limits,
regardless
of 
what
the
construction
contract
calls
for
and
despite
the
fact
that,
under
the
current
edition
of
ISO
AI 
endorsements,
the
AI
may
only
be
entitled
to
the
contract
limits. 
In
addition,
keep
in
mind
that
the
ACORD
25
is
certifying
what
coverage
is
available
to
the
insured
,
not
67necessarily
to
another
party
such
as
an
AI.
And,
while
the
contract
may
specify
a
minimum
insurance 
limit,
it
usually
also
has
an
unlimited
indemnity
agreement
making
the
insured
responsible
for 
indemnification
that
may
not
be
covered
or
adequately
covered
by
insurance. 
The
construction
contract
asks
for
proof
that
the
contractor
has
at
least
a
$1
million
insurance
limit. 
Therefore,
do
you
comply
with
the
literal
reading
of
the
certificate
(and
ACORD
instructions)
and
show 
the
actual
policy
limits,
maybe
providing
more
information
that
the
insured
would
want
the
contracting 
party
to
know?
Or
do
you
adhere
to
the
perceived
spirit
of
the
construction
contract
by
only
advising
that 
the
insured
has
the
minimal
limits
required? 
As
an
aside,
while
the
current
editions
of
ISO
AI
endorsements
say
that
an
AI
is
entitled
only
to
the
lesser 
of
the
policy
limit
or
contractual
insurance
requirement,
many
contracts
today
are
being
written
to
require 
an
amount
of
insurance
“at
least
equal”
to
or
“no
less
than”
the
limit
provided
by
the
policy
in
an
attempt 
to
overcome
this
limitation. 
Limits—CGL
Damage
to
Rented
Premises
Leases
typically
make
tenants
responsible
for
damage
to
rented
premises.
Decades
ago,
this
requirement 
was
often
limited
to
fire
damage
to
rented
premises.
As
a
result,
to
avoid
having
to
purchase
separate 
coverage
for
damage
to
rented
real
property,
most
CGL
policies
added
an
option
for
“fire
damage
legal 
liability”
coverage. 
However,
today,
most
leases
hold
the
tenant
responsible
for
damage
to
rented
premises
for
almost 
anything
beyond
normal
wear
and
tear,
and
this
liability
is
often
imposed
without
regard
to
fault
of
the 
tenant.
For
example,
if
a
vandal
breaks
a
large
plate
glass
window,
the
tenant
may
be
held
responsible
for 
the
damage
under
the
lease.
For
this
reason,
CGL
coverage
only
for
fire
damage
is
of
relatively
little 
value
by
itself.
Fortunately,
ISO
and
insurers
have
other
ways
to
cover
this
exposure. 
Where
this
provision
is
often
abused
is
when
the
insured
is
a
contractor
or
service
provider
and
not
a 
tenant.
For
example,
one
contract
with
a
paving
company
hired
to
repaint
lines
in
a
strip
shopping
center 
parking
lot
required
a
$500,000
limit
of
insurance
for
damage
to
rented
premises.
Why
would
a
contract 
have
a
requirement
like
this?
Likely
because
the
individual
drafting
the
insurance
requirements
doesn’t 
understand
what
“Damage
to
Rented
Premises”
means.
Quite
possibly,
the
drafter
of
this
contract
was
the 
same
individual
who
drafted
the
leases
for
the
tenants
and
included
this
requirement
simply
because
it 
was
included
in
the
leases. 
An
astute
agent
should
catch
unreasonable
requests
like
this
and
accept
them
as
opportunities
to
educate 
upstream
parties. 
Description
of
Operations
This
field
is
probably
the
most
“abused”
of
all
fields
on
the
ACORD
25.
When
superfluous
comments
are 
requested
or
demanded
to
be
added
to
the
ACORD
25,
the
contract
usually
specifies
this
field
as
the
place 
for
such
verbiage.
So,
what
commentary
can
be
entered
in
the
Description
of
Operations
(DOO)
field
of 
the
ACORD
25? 
Generally
speaking,
if
what
you’re
being
asked
to
show
in
the
DOO
field
is
not
illegal
(a
violation
of 
insurance
or
other
laws,
regulations,
or
regulatory
directives),
and
it’s
not
a
violation
of
your 
agency/company
agreement
(you
have
permission
from
the
insurer
to
enter
that
language
on
their
behalf), 
and
it
does
not
misrepresent
policy
coverages,
limits,
and
terms,
you
can
put
anything
you’re
asked
on 
the
certificate
and
assume
any
potential
liability
as
a
business
risk
hopefully
covered
by
your
E&O
policy.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
right
to
do
something
doesn’t
mean
that
doing
it
is
right,
but,
again,
that’s
a 
business
decision
made
daily
by
agents
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
The
ACORD
FIG
recommends
that
a 
certificate
not
be
used
“[t]o
quote
wording
from
a
contract,”
and
adverse
case
law
against
agents
supports 
the
suggestion
that
certificate
verbiage
be
kept
to
a
minimum. 
Specifically,
regarding
the
DOO
field,
the
ACORD
25
preprinted
language
says
that
this
field
is
used
to 
provide
a
description
of
operations,
location,
and
vehicle
information.
If
space
is
inadequate,
the
ACORD 
101
Additional
Remarks
Schedule
can
be
added.
The
ACORD
25
FIG
says,
68As
used
here,
records
information
necessary
to
identify
the
operations,
locations
and
vehicles
for 
which
the
certificate
was
issued. 
Nothing
on
the
form
or
the
instruction
guide
suggests
that
it
is
appropriate
to
include
elaboration
about 
AIs,
subrogation
waivers,
or
any
other
information.
One
exception
is
noted
on
the
form
in
that,
if
certain 
individuals
are
excluded
from
workers
compensation
coverage,
that
information
can
be
described
in
the 
DOO
field.
In
an
earlier
edition
of
the
ACORD
25,
this
field
also
allowed
for
the
listing
of
“exclusions 
added
by
endorsement”
and
“special
provisions,”
but
that
language
has
not
been
on
the
form
since
2009.
It
is
generally
better,
with
the
insured’s
permission,
to
simply
provide
a
copy
of
the
applicable
policy 
form(s)
and
refer
the
requestor
to
the
insurance
contract
to
determine
if
it
meets
the
requirements
of
the 
requestor’s
contract
with
the
insured.
Since
the
requestor
drafted
the
contract
with
the
insured,
only
the 
requestor
is
qualified
to
definitively
determine
if
an
insured’s
insurance
program
meets
the
requirements 
of
the
contract.
This
is
particularly
true
when
it
comes
to
AI
status
and
for
a
reason
discussed
later
in
this 
course. 
Cancellation
A
certificate
holder
will
sometimes
request
that
notice
be
provided
of
cancellation,
nonrenewal,
or
even
a 
“material
change”
(whatever
that
might
be
interpreted
to
mean)
in
coverage.
Typically,
the
request
is
for 
30
days
(or
more)
notice.
The
following
example
is
from
a
commercial
lease. 
 
All
policies
of
Tenant’s
Insurance
shall
contain
endorsements
that
the
insurer(s)
shall
give 
Landlord
and
its
designees
at
least
30
days’
notice
of
any
cancellation,
termination,
material 
change,
or
lapse
of
insurance. 
No
common
commercial
policy
grants
this
type
of
broad
notice,
and
use
of
the
term
“All
policies”
is 
overly
broad
in
that
it
could
be
construed
to
apply
even
to
auto
and
other
policies
in
which
the
landlord 
would
have
no
interest. 
As
a
practical
matter,
most
AI
endorsements
don’t
extend
a
right
of
notification
of
cancellation,
much
less 
a
right
of
notification
of
a
“material
change.”
Under
an
ISO
Commercial
Package
Policy,
notice
of 
cancellation
is
required
to
be
provided
only
to
the
first
named
insured.
In
addition,
unless
state
statutes 
specify
otherwise,
the
insurer
normally
only
has
to
provide
the
first
named
insured
with
10
days’
notice
of 
cancellation
for
nonpayment
or
30
days
for
other
valid
reasons. 
Prior
to
2009,
ACORD
certificates
said
that
the
insurer
would
“endeavor
to”
provide
notice
of 
cancellation
to
the
certificate
holder.
Various
dictionary
definitions
of
“endeavor”
include
the
following. 
•
To
exert
oneself
to
do
or
effect
something;
make
an
effort;
strive
•
A
strenuous
effort;
attempt
•
A
conscientious
or
concerted
effort
toward
an
end;
an
earnest
attempt
•
To
attempt
by
employment
or
expenditure
of
effort
Clearly,
“endeavor”
meant
at
least
to
try
and
probably
to
make
a
significant
effort
to
provide
notice.
By 
2009,
few
insurers
made
any
effort
to
provide
notice
of
cancellation,
most
flatly
refusing
to
do
so.
A 
statement
on
the
certificate
that
the
insurer
would
“endeavor
to”
provide
notice
was
perceived
by
many
to 
be
at
least
unethical,
if
not
outright
misrepresentative. 
Another
point
made
by
insurers
was
that,
if
cancellation
was
initiated
due
to
nonpayment
or
a
missed 
premium
installment,
but
ultimately
the
insured
paid
and
coverage
was
never
canceled
or
it
was 
reinstated,
the
certificate
holder
then
had
to
be
notified
a
second
time.
This
sometimes
frustrated
and 
angered
both
agents
and
insureds,
not
to
mention
that
the
entire
process
was
expensive,
and,
if
notice
to
a 
certificate
holder
was
mistakenly
not
made,
it
might
open
the
insurer
to
liability. 
In
addition,
prior
cancellation
notice
language
did
not
distinguish
between
cancellation
by
the
insured
or 
insurer.
Given
that
the
insured
usually
can
cancel
immediately,
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
a
certificate
69holder
advanced
notice. 
As
a
result,
in
2009,
the
cancellation
provision
on
ACORD
certificates
was
revised
to
state
that
notice 
would
be
provided
in
accordance
with
policy
provisions.
Again,
under
ISO
rules,
other
than
exceptions 
for
mortgagees
or
certain
loss
payees,
no
one
other
than
the
first
named
insured
is
entitled
to
notice
of 
cancellation.
None
of
ISO’s
AI
endorsements
provide
cancellation
notice
to
the
AI,
though
there
are 
insurers
whose
forms
might
or
that
have
cancellation
notice
endorsements
used
with
underwriting 
discretion. 
E&O
experts
recommend
against
agents
voluntarily
providing
such
notice,
and,
depending
on
how
they 
are
interpreted,
some
state
laws
or
regulations
may
preclude
any
notice
unless
provided
by
the
insurance 
contracts. 
Specifically,
in
the
construction
industry,
if
cancellation
notice
is
essential,
then
in
lieu
of
AI
status,
the 
party
requesting
the
certificate
could
ask
the
insured
to
obtain
an
owners
and
contractors
protective
policy 
if
the
insurer
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
extend
cancellation
notice
to
AIs
and
such
notice
is
critical. 
Summary
All
agency
personnel
using
ACORD
forms
should
have
access
to
the
FIGs
for
each
form.
Many
E&O 
experts
recommend
that
the
FIG
be
incorporated
into
the
agency
procedures
manual,
at
least
by
reference. 
What
can
or
should
be
shown
in
the
various
fields
of
the
ACORD
25
are,
or
should
be,
governed
by
the 
FIG
and
reasonable
agency
procedures
based
on
legal
requirements,
sound
E&O
loss
control
principles, 
and
the
business
strategy
of
the
agency.

Other
Certificate
of
Insurance
Issues
Overview
In
the
last
section,
we
examined
a
number
of
issues
that
arise
when
completing
an
Association
for 
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and
Development
(ACORD)
25.
In
this
section,
we
will
consider
a 
number
of
real-life
examples
of
information
agents
often
request
that
may
be
considered
unreasonable, 
improper,
impossible,
or
even
illegal.
The
reason
for
this
exercise
is
to
make
the
student
aware
of
the 
types
of
information
requests
that
take
place
in
the
marketplace
and
to
explain
why
the
agent
must
be
very 
careful
in
how
they
respond
to
such
requests,
especially
when
referred
to
as
“warranties”
or
“affidavits.” 
In
addition,
we’ll
discuss
related
issues
such
as
lender
requests
to
provide
policy
limits
greater
than
the 
value
of
the
property
that
is
the
subject
of
a
loan,
what
is
meant
by
“primary
and
noncontributory,” 
responding
to
“following
form”
excess
and
“Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO),
or
equivalent” 
requirements,
sending
copies
of
certificates
to
insurer,
sending
additional
insured
(AI)
endorsements
or 
other
policy
forms
to
AIs,
and
using
online
certificate
systems. 
The
first
question
is,
why
are
agents
sometimes
expected
to
do
the
unreasonable
or
impossible?
These
are 
reasons
perhaps
you’ve
heard
from
certificate
requestors. 
•
“Every
other
contractor
working
[at
this]
facility
is
able
to
obtain
coverage
with
this
clause.”

port

•
“I’ve
never
had
an
agent
refuse
to
do
this.

you
won’t
do
it,
we
can
give
your
customer
a
list
of 
agents
who
will.”

the
certificate
as
requested.”
– 
state
governmental
entity
Agents
are
asked
to
do
things
every
day
but
maybe
shouldn’t
be.
If
the
agent
is
willing
and
able
to 
comply,
they
should
exercise
due
diligence
and
great
care. 
Chapter
Objectives
Upon
conclusion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
71•
identify
the
pitfalls
in
issuing
“affidavits,”
warranty
statements,
compliance
checklists,
and
similar 
documents;
•
identify
reasons
to
be
wary
of
warranting
“primary
and
noncontributory”
coverage,
“following 
form”
excess
or
umbrella
coverage,
and
other
easily
misinterpreted
terminology;
•
recognize
why
certain
verbiage
should
not
be
used
verbatim
on
a
certificate
of
insurance
(COI)
and 
how
to
recognize
such
language;
•
identify
reasons
why
underwriters
should
be
copied
on
issued
certificates;
•
recognize
the
value
of
providing
AIs
copies
of
relevant
policy
forms,
especially
in
lieu
of
making 
coverage
or
AI
status
comments
on
certificates;
and
•
identify
potential
pitfalls
in
the
use
of
online
certificate
systems.
What
Information
Can
Be
Included
on
a
COI?
As
discussed
earlier,
as
long
as
what
you’re
asked
to
include
on
a
COI
is
not
illegal,
a
violation
of
your 
agency/company
agreement,
or
arguably
a
misrepresentation
of
coverage
or
policy
terms,
you
can
put 
whatever
is
requested
on
a
COI
or
other
document.
Again,
the
right
to
do
that
doesn’t
mean
that
doing
it 
is
right
or
advisable.
In
such
cases,
the
agent
must
balance
the
business
decision
against
the
errors
and 
omissions
(E&O)
exposure.
As
one
defense
attorney
put
it, 
Any
time
you
attempt
to
summarize
policy
language
on
a
certificate
of
insurance,
you
are
opening 
yourself
up
to
the
possibility
of
allegations
that
you
have
misrepresented
policy
terms.
Many 
coverages,
exclusions,
and
conditions
do
not
lend
themselves
to
one-sentence
summary
statements 
and
the
failure
to
adequately
and
completely
express
such
policy
terms
can
result
in
successful
E&O 
claims,
allegations
of
fraud,
and
censure
(or
worse)
by
insurance
regulators. 
Particular
care
should
be
given
when
such
requests
are
made
to
elicit
some
sort
of
warranty
or
guarantee 
of
coverage,
as
discussed
below. 
Agent
“Affidavits”
or
Warranties
of
Coverage
or
Policy
Terms
Requests
to
add
explanatory
or
summary
verbiage
on
certificates
are
common.
Less
common
and 
probably
much
more
dangerous
given
the
likely
absence
of
disclaimers
are
requests
involving
forms
with 
various
titles
such
as
the
following. 
•
Agent
Affidavit
•
Pre-Qualification
Document
•
Coverage
Verification
•
Certificate
Confirmation
Affidavit
•
Agent
Opinion
Letter
•
Coverage
Questionnaire
•
Agent/Broker
Affirmation
•
Compliance
Checklist
•
Insurance
Warranty
Statement
These
types
of
supplementary
documents
often
include
language
that
effectively
serves
as
an
E&O
noose 
in
which
agents
are
asked
to
stick
their
necks.
For
example,
consider
the
following
document
required
of 
a
franchisee’s
agent. 
Agent
Waiver
Application
I,
[agent’s
name]
acknowledge
that
I
have
read
and
fully
understand
the
insurance
requirements
as
72provided
and
the
indemnification
language
as
detailed
in
the
Franchise
Agreement….
I
understand
that
it
is
my
responsibility
to
ensure
that
all
required
coverages
and
additional
insureds
are 
endorsed
to
the
policy.
I
understand
that
I
am
required
to
carry
a
minimum
of
$2
million
per
occurrence
Errors
and
Omissions 
coverage
and
I
acknowledge
that
I
meet
this
requirement.
I
further
acknowledge
that
I
may
be
liable
for 
any
omission
if
a
claim
is
brought
against
an
additional
insured
and
I
have
failed
to
ensure
that
the
entity 
was
properly
endorsed.
 
Does
your
agency’s
E&O
policy
cover
a
written
admission
of
liability
for
“any”
omission
(even
if 
committed
by
an
underwriter)?
You
might
remember
this
actual
E&O
policy
excerpt
cited
earlier
in
this 
course. 
The
insured
shall
not,
without
our
written
consent,
do
any
of
the
following:
 
1.
Admit
liability…. 
A
certificate
holder
may
request
that
the
agent
include
a
letter
or
form,
sometimes
required
to
be 
witnessed
and/or
notarized,
attesting
to
the
fact
that,
“In
the
opinion
of
the
agent,
the
policy
contains
the 
required
insurance
coverages/indemnifications
required
by
the
contract
with
the
insured.”
Examples 
include
the
following. 
•
“It
is
agreed
that
the
coverages,
endorsements
and
conditions
shown
on
these
pages
are
in 
effect
and
apply,
as
indicated,
to
the
coverages
certified
on
the
attached
‘Certificate’
and 
‘Marine
contract’
and
the
Certificate
Holder
is
entitled
to
rely
on
them.”
This
affidavit
included
a
“compliance
checklist”
with
40
questions
and
required
notarization
and 
witnessing
by
someone
not
an
employee
of
the
agency
or
the
contractor.
What
does
“entitled” 
mean? 
•
“This
‘Certificate
Confirmation
Affidavit’
certifies
that
the
insurance
provided
conforms
to 
the
construction
contract.”
This
agent
affidavit
was
required
by
a
general
contractor.
What
does
“certifies”
mean
in
the
absence 
of
any
disclaimer
as
to
its
presumed
meaning
as
a
warranty
of
coverage? 
•
“Insurance
policies
will
remain
in
force
until
the
expiration
of
the
statute
of
repose.”
This
provision
in
an
agent
affidavit
was
required
by
a
public
entity
in
a
state
with
a
10-year
statute 
of
repose.
How
can
the
agent
ensure
that
policies
will
remain
in
force
for
the
next
10
years? 
•
“I
have
reviewed
the
insurance
requirements
contained
in
the
‘XYZ’
contract
and 
determined
that
our
agency
can
provide
the
needed
coverages
in
accordance
with
those 
specifications
and
without
substitutions.”
At
least
it
doesn’t
say
“will”
provide
the
needed
coverages,
though
substitutions
are
common. 
A
“Compliance
Checklist”
mandated
by
one
large
corporation
to
be
completed
by
a
contractor’s
agent 
included
pages
of
5-
to
6-word
cryptic
coverage
questions
that
would
require
almost
500
entries
by
the 
agent
to
complete,
with
many
of
them
requiring
guesswork
as
to
what
the
actual
question
meant. 
A
bank
demanded
that
a
customer’s
agent
submit
a
“certified”
affidavit
of
insurance
that
said, 
Agent
hereby
represents
and
certifies
to
Lender,
as
of
the
date
hereof,
that
the
provided
commercial 
property
insurance
certificate
completely
and
accurately
reflects
the
insurance
in
force
under
the 
insurance
policies
for
the
above
named
Property.
 
No
certificate
of
insurance
“completely”
reflects
the
insurance
in
force.
The
very
essence
of
a
COI
is
that 
it
is
a
basic
summary
or
enumeration
of
policy
forms. 
73Addressing
Unreasonable,
Improper,
Impossible,
and/or
Possibly 
Illegal
Insurance
Requests
Contracts
or
insurance
specifications
sometimes
insist
upon
statements
to
be
shown
verbatim
in
a 
certificate
or
a
supplementary
document.
Below
is
a
listing
of
sample
verbiage
requests,
each
followed
by 
a
notation
of
why
the
requested
language
could
be
problematic. 
•
“Building
covered
at
100%
replacement
cost.”
Is
this
a
requirement
to
insure
the
building
on
a
100
percent
coinsurance
or
guaranteed
replacement 
cost
basis?
Or
is
it
a
warranty
that
the
limit
of
insurance
on
the
building
will
cover
100
percent
of 
the
actual
replacement
cost
at
the
time
of
loss?
Or
does
it
mean
something
else?
These
questions 
should
be
answered
before
a
loss
occurs. 
•
“There
are
no
claims
(pending
or
paid)
that
could
significantly
reduce
the
aggregate.”
How
is
the
agent
supposed
to
know
if
a
claim
is
pending?
Should
the
agent
contact
the
insured
and 
the
claims
department
to
confirm
this
before
issuing
the
certificate?
And
what
constitutes 
“significantly”
reducing
the
aggregate?
Not
understanding
or
knowing
what
these
questions
mean
in 
the
mind
of
the
COI
requestor
is
one
reason
not
to
include
this
verbatim
statement
on
the
certificate. 
•
“Insurer
will
provide
written
notice
of
any
reduction
of
coverage
with
reasonable 
promptness.”
What
constitutes
a
reduction
of
coverage?
Increasing
the
deductible?
Issuing
an
auto
lay-up 
endorsement?
And
what
constitutes
“reasonable
promptness”?
Does
the
policy
provide
for
notice
to 
the
COI
holder
if
coverage
is
reduced?
Has
the
agent
been
granted
the
authority
by
the
insurer
to 
make
statements
like
this?
Highly
unlikely. 
•
“Property
insurance
is
provided
without
limitation
on
an
All
Risks
basis.”
What
does
“without
limitation”
mean
no
limit
of
insurance
and
no
exclusions?
The
term
“all
risks” 
is
one
usually
not
found
in
most
policies,
and
it’s
a
term
used
too
often
within
the
industry
as 
illustrated
in
the
number
of
court
decisions
where
the
use
of
that
term
was
material
in
a
decision 
against
the
agent
or
insurer.
It
is
often
a
mistake
to
describe
policy
coverage
or
terms
using 
language
not
in
the
insurance
contract
itself. 
•
“General
liability
insurance
includes
blanket
contractual,
broad
form
property
damage,
and 
coverage
for
independent
contractors.”
The
term
“blanket
contractual”
likely
refers
to
the
“insured
contract”
exception
in
the
ISO 
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy’s
contractual
liability
exclusion,
but
it
is
a
descriptive 
phrase
not
found
in
that
form
and
should
be
avoided.
Likewise,
the
term
“broad
form
property 
damage”
has
been
obsolete
for
decades.
With
regard
to
“coverage
for
independent
contractors,”
is 
that
referring
to
coverage
for
an
insured
if
held
liable
for
the
acts
of
an
independent
contractor 
(probably),
or
does
it
imply
that
independent
contractors
are
themselves
insureds
under
the
policy? 
These
are
issues
too
often
litigated
when
vague
phrases
are
referenced
without
a
clear
understanding 
of
their
meaning. 
•
“The
coverage
afforded
under
this
certificate
shall
be
primary.”
Certificates
of
insurance
don’t
afford
any
coverage.
While
the
statement
is
probably
an
assertion 
that
the
referenced
policy
provides
coverage
that
is
primary
and
noncontributory,
the
phrasing 
implies
that
the
certificate
itself
extends
such
primary
coverage. 
•
“Automobile
Property
Damage
Liability
is
provided
as
Occurrence
Basis
Coverage.”
It
is
the
rare
auto
policy
that
covers
claims
on
an
occurrence
basis.
Auto
policies
almost
always
74cover
“accidents,”
not
“occurrences”—a
minor
distinction
but
possibly
an
important
one. 
•
“There
is
no
exclusion
for
damage
resulting
from
leaking
galvanized
pipes.”
This
probably
refers
to
the
requirement
of
no
specific
exclusion
related
to
galvanized
pipes,
but 
leaking
pipes
can
cause
types
of
damage
that
might
otherwise
be
excluded
without
a
specific 
galvanized
pipe
exclusion. 
•
“There
is
no
exclusion
for
giant
robot
attacks.”
OK,
we
made
that
one
up.
Just
making
sure
you’re
paying
attention. 
•
“Insurer
agrees
to
accept
Contractor’s
choice
of
counsel.”
Is
that
specified
in
the
policy?
Again,
is
the
agent
authorized
to
accept
this
on
behalf
of
the
insurer? 
Highly
unlikely. 
•
“In
the
event
insurance
requirements
are
not
met
and
any
coverages
required
have
not
been 
obtained,
agent
or
broker
agrees
to
be
directly
responsible
therefor
and
consents
to
direct 
suit
by
any
party
to
be
named
as
an
additional
insured
hereunder.”
Yes,
an
agency
customer
service
representative
(CSR)
actually
placed
that
statement
in
the 
Description
of
Operations
on
an
ACORD
25.
This
illustrates
why
the
certificate
issuance
process
is 
not
a
clerical
function
and
requires
proper
training
and
oversight. 
•
“Other
States
endorsement
included.”
Since
the
1990s,
“Other
States”
coverage
has
been
included
as
an
option
in
the
National
Council
on 
Compensation
Insurance
workers
compensation
policy
itself
and
not
as
a
separate
endorsement. 
•
“Coverage
for
additional
insureds
is
not
impacted
by
any
breach
of
the
insurance
policy
by 
the
named
insured.”
Many,
if
not
most,
policies
have
some
provision
(e.g.,
fraud)
that
may
void
the
policy
so
that
no
one 
is
entitled
to
coverage
absent
an
“innocent
insured”
exception
or
applicable
separation
of
insureds 
clause. 
•
“All
requirements
from
our
Project
Manual
are
covered
by
the
Insurance
Certificate.”
The
odds
are
that
the
agent
has
not
read
the
project
manual,
and,
again,
insurance
certificates
don’t 
“cover”
anything. 
•
“Assault
and
Battery
is
not
excluded.”
Most
likely,
this
refers
to
a
specific
“Assault
and
Battery”
exclusion
by
that
name.
However,
given 
that
many
policies
have
“intentional
or
expected
loss”
exclusions,
it’s
possible
that
assault
and 
battery
are
governed
by
an
exclusion
other
than
one
with
that
name.
If
the
agent
asserts,
with
this 
statement,
that
assault
and
battery
are
effectively
covered,
although
the
policy
has
an
intentional 
loss
exclusion,
an
E&O
claim
will
likely
arise
if
the
intentional
loss
exclusion
is
invoked. 
•
“Comprehensive
form
of
general
liability
provided
which
includes
personal
injury
with 
Employment
Exclusion
deleted.”
“CGL”
has
referred
to
commercial,
not
comprehensive,
general
liability
for
decades.
The
use
of
the 
word
“Comprehensive,”
as
discussed
earlier,
is
archaic
and
usually
illustrates
the
contract
drafter’s 
unfamiliarity
with
the
current
insurance
marketplace.
“Employment
Exclusion”
is
a
term
not
found 
in
mainstream
CGL
policies
today,
so
its
meaning
is
unknown. 
•
“A
properly
executed
copy
of
this
document
[non-ACORD
certificate]
shall
be
legally
75binding
as
a
Carrier
Certificate
of
Insurance
Form.
“Legally
binding”
on
whom
and
for
what
and
to
what
extent?
Anytime
the
word
“legal”
is
required 
on
a
COI
or
other
document,
be
wary. 
•
“Policy
covers
Certificate
Holder
without
restrictions
or
limitations
based
on
negligence.”
No
policy
provides
coverage
without
restrictions
and
limitations,
yet
a
producer
insisted
that
an 
agency
CSR
add
this
statement
to
a
COI
allegedly
because
the
insured
could
not
get
a
job
without 
that
statement
on
the
COI.
Keep
in
mind,
as
discussed
earlier,
that
upstream
parties
will
sometimes 
make
demands
they
know
are
unreasonable,
impractical,
or
worse.
Refusal
to
include
statements 
like
the
one
above
are
rarely
deal
breakers.
Most
likely,
this
is
simply
on
the
requestor’s
wish
list, 
or,
at
worse,
the
upstream
party
has
a
fallback
position
that
allows
for
negotiation
of
the
language. 
•
“Other
Insurance
clause
in
policy
states
this
insurance
is
primary.”
As
discussed
later
in
this
chapter,
CGL
policy
primacy
is
predominantly
determined
by
the 
upstream
party’s
policy,
not
the
downstream
party’s
policy.
More
likely,
the
requestor
is
interested 
in
an
endorsement
that
asserts
the
downstream
insurer’s
intent
for
its
policy
to
be
primary,
but
that 
is
normally
not
found
in
the
other
insurance
clause. 
•
“Snow
plowing
operation
is
covered
by
the
policy.”
There
might
not
be
a
specific
“snow
plowing”
exclusion,
but
there
could
be
other
exclusions
that 
apply.
In
addition,
while
an
ongoing
snow
plowing
operation
might
be
covered
under
an
auto 
policy,
a
completed
operation
might
not
(given,
for
example,
that
ISO’s
business
auto
policy
does 
not
cover
completed
operations),
at
least
without
an
endorsement
to
that
effect
on
this
or
another 
policy.
This
illustrates
why
competent
coverage
knowledge
is
critical
in
evaluating
statements
like 
this. 
•
“Additional
insured
endorsements
shall
not
contain
ANY
restrictions.”
No
AI
endorsement
exists
without
some
restrictions
in
coverage,
limits,
or
terms. 
•
“Policy
includes
Contractual
Liability
and
Pollution
Liability.
(Y/N)”
The
ISO
CGL
policy
includes
a
contractual
liability
exclusion
,
but
certain
contracts
are
covered
by 
exception.
Likewise,
some
pollution
liability
coverage
is
provided
by
exception
or
absence
in
the 
pollution
exclusion.
So,
the
statement
is
both
correct
and
incorrect
and
completely
pointless.
Either 
response
(Y/N)
would
be
true
and
false. 
•
“All
policies
are
primary
and
noncontributory.
(Y/N)”
The
policies
listed
on
the
ACORD
25
included
workers
compensation,
which
certainly
did
not 
extend
to
the
upstream
party’s
employees
on
a
primary
and
noncontributory
basis. 
•
“Effective
immediately,
all
liability
insurance
forms
must
indicate
that
‘NO
EXCLUSIONS 
APPLY.’
This
must
be
clearly
indicated
on
each
certificate
of
insurance
submitted
with
every 
building
permit
application.
No
application
will
be
accepted
with
certificates
that
do
not 
contain
these
words.”
This
was
an
insurance
requirement
of
all
contractors
doing
work
for
a
New
York
village.
Needless 
to
say,
an
insurance
agent
uprising
put
an
end
to
this
requirement. 
Lastly,
sometimes
insurance
requirements
specify
certain
ISO
policy
forms
but
may
allow
for
an 
equivalent
form
by
requiring
an
“ISO
or
equivalent”
form
or
saying
that
the
form
must
be
“no
more 
restrictive
than”
a
specified
ISO
form.
So,
what
does
“ISO
or
equivalent”
mean?
According
to 
Merriam-Webster,
“equivalent”
means
“virtually
identical,
especially
in
effect
or
function.”
In
other 
words,
if
it’s
not
the
specified
ISO
form,
it’s
not
“equivalent.”
It
may
be
similar
or
comparable,
but
it’s
76not
virtually
identical. 
Lender
Requirements
for
Property
Limits
Equal
to
the
Outstanding 
Balance
of
a
Loan
Entities
that
have
a
direct
interest
in
property
being
purchased
want
to
ensure
that
the
loans
secured
by 
real
estate
are
adequately
insured
so
that
the
property
can
be
rebuilt
if
damaged
or
destroyed.
As
a
result, 
sometimes
lenders
will
demand
a
policy
limit
equal
to
the
outstanding
balance
of
the
loan
without
regard 
to
the
actual
replacement
cost
of
the
building. 
The
problem
with
this
is
that
the
loan
amount
is
likely
based
on
the
market
value
of
the
premises
and
not 
just
the
replacement
cost
of
the
structure.
Market
value
is
often
greater
than
replacement
cost.
Market 
value
also
includes
the
value
of
the
land,
something
typically
excluded
by
property
insurance
policies.
So, 
even
if
the
insured
value
equals
the
outstanding
loan
balance,
neither
the
insured
nor
the
lender
could
ever 
collect
the
full
amount
because
it
includes
the
value
of
uninsured
property. 
Many
states
have
laws
making
it
illegal
for
lenders
to
require
an
amount
of
insurance
greater
than
the 
replacement
cost
of
the
insured
property.
For
example, 
No
lender
shall
require
a
borrower,
as
a
condition
of
receiving
or
maintaining
a
loan
secured
by
real 
property,
to
provide
hazard
insurance
coverage
against
risks
to
the
improvements
on
that
real 
property
in
an
amount
exceeding
the
replacement
value
of
the
improvements
on
the
property. 
In
addition,
some
states
have
“over-insurance”
or
“valued
policy”
laws
that
might
govern
loans
on
real 
property. 
Primary
and
Noncontributory
Many,
if
not
most,
contracts
require
that
downstream
parties
provide
“primary
and
noncontributory” 
liability
coverage
for
upstream
parties.
Upstream
parties
who
are
AIs
will
often
want
a
unilateral 
confirmation
of
this
from
the
downstream
party’s
insurance
agent
in
the
form
of
a
statement
on
a 
certificate
or
other
document. 
Customary
industry
usage
or
meaning
of
the
term
“primary
and
noncontributory”
is
that
the
downstream 
party’s
policy
pays
first,
without
any
contribution
from
the
upstream
party’s
policy.
The
upstream
party’s 
policy,
at
best,
provides
excess
coverage
if
the
downstream
party’s
policy
limit
is
exhausted. 
Assuming
that
both
parties
have
ISO
CGL
policies,
the
problem
is
that
it
is
the
other
insurance
clause
in 
the
upstream
party’s
CGL
policy
is
the
one
that
governs
primacy.
For
example, 
Other
Insurance 
If
other
valid
and
collectible
insurance
is
available
to
the
insured
for
a
loss
we
cover
under 
Coverages
A
or
B
of
this
Coverage
Part,
our
obligations
are
limited
as
follows: 
a.
Primary
Insurance 
This
insurance
is
primary
except
when
Paragraph
b.
below
applies.
If
this
insurance
is
primary,
our 
obligations
are
not
affected
unless
any
of
the
other
insurance
is
also
primary.
Then,
we
will
share 
with
all
that
other
insurance
by
the
method
described
in
Paragraph
c.
below. 
b.
Excess
Insurance 
 
(1)
This
insurance
is
excess
over: 
 
(b)
Any
other
primary
insurance
available
to
you
covering
liability
for
damages 
arising
out
of
the
premises
or
operations,
or
the
products
and
completed
operations, 
for
which
you
have
been
added
as
an
additional
insured.
[
Emphasis
added.] 
In
reality,
one
must
look
to
this
provision
in
both
policies
to
determine
primacy,
especially
when
the 
upstream
policy
is
not
an
ISO
form.
As
result,
the
downstream
party
cannot
absolutely
guarantee
that
its 
CGL
policy
is
truly
primary
without
examining
the
upstream
party’s
CGL
policy,
as
found
in
Graphic
77Arts
Mut.
Ins.
Co.
v.
Essex
Ins.
Co.
26 
The
primacy
issue
can
be
more
complicated
when
it
comes
to
auto
and
excess
liability
forms.
For 
example,
the
current
ISO
business
auto
policy
is
primary
only
if
the
named
insured
owns
the
vehicle
or 
assumes
liability
under
contract
(Condition
5,
Other
Insurance,
subparagraph
c.);
otherwise,
the
coverage 
is
excess.
Umbrella
policies
are
largely
company-specific
and
therefore
do
not
follow
ISO
verbiage
in
all 
instances.
And,
again,
not
all
CGL
policies
are
ISO
forms. 
The
industry
solution,
though
not
perfect,
is
to
offer
an
endorsement
expressing
the
downstream
party’s 
intent
that
its
policy
be
primary.
ISO
accomplishes
this
with
its
Primary
and
Noncontributory—Other 
Insurance
Condition
endorsement
(CG
20
01)
for
the
CGL
policy
and
with
their
Primary
and 
Noncontributory—Other
Insurance
Condition
(CA
04
49),
Noncontributory—Other
Insurance
Condition 
(CU
24
78),
and
Noncontributory—Other
Insurance
Condition
(CX
24
33)
endorsements
for
auto, 
umbrella,
and
excess
policies,
respectively.
In
addition,
many
insurers
have
similar
endorsements
or 
incorporate
the
“primary
and
noncontributory”
language
into
their
AI
endorsements. 
This
issue
gets
even
more
complicated
with
required
limits
of
insurance
are
met
by,
for
example,
a 
combination
of
CGL
and
excess/umbrella
liability
insurance.
Between
the
contracting
parties,
how
are 
such
policy
limits
exhausted,
vertically
or
horizontally? 
Following
Form
Excess
Requirements
The
following
is
a
statement
from
a
“coverage
checklist”
a
general
contractor
was
requiring
a 
subcontractor’s
agent
to
complete. 
Umbrella
or
excess
liability
insurance
is
“Following
Form”
to
the
General
Liability
Policy,
meaning 
no
additional
exclusions
that
aren’t
already
on
the
CGL
policy
(Y/N). 
It
is
the
rare
umbrella
or
excess
policy
that
truly
follows
the
form
of
underlying
policies
and
contains
no 
additional
exclusions.
Since
umbrellas
often
provide
much
broader
liability
coverage
than
the
underlying 
policies,
they
almost
certainly
will
have
exclusions
not
found
in
those
policies
or,
otherwise,
they’d
cover 
anything
that
could
possibly
happen.
Many
umbrella
and
excess
policies,
unlike
underlying
auto
forms, 
provide
no
uninsured
motorists
coverage.
Coverage
for
damage
to
rented
premises
provided
by
CGL 
policies
is
usually
not
duplicated
in
excess
forms,
and
that
may
be
expressed
by
exclusion. 
Sending
Certificates
to
Insurers
At
one
time,
agents
routinely
sent
copies
of
certificates
to
insurers.
One
reason
was
that
certificates
at
one 
time
indicated
that
insurers
might
“endeavor
to”
provide
notice
of
cancellation
and
that
would
not
be 
possible
unless
the
insurer
was
aware
of
that
assertion
on
the
certificate.
Now
that
this
language
is
no 
longer
on
ACORD
certificates,
many
insurers
have
advised
agents
not
to
send
copies
of
certificates.
E&O 
experts
caution
otherwise. 
One
of
the
reasons
is
that
mistakes
might
be
made
in
providing
coverage
or
AI
status,
and
it’s
unclear 
where
that
mistake
occurred,
in
the
agency
or
the
insurer’s
underwriting
department.
In
fact,
there
are 
some
insurer
“blanket”
AI
endorsements
where
coverage
is
triggered
by
the
issuance
of
a
COI. 
Two
cases
often
cited
by
E&O
experts
as
a
basis
for
copying
insurers
on
COIs
are
Marlin
v.
Wetzel
27
and 
Erie
v.
National
Grange
Mut
.
28 
In
Marlin
v.
Wetzel
Cty.
Bd.
of
Educ.
,
the
court
opined, 
[T]he
insurance
company
asserted
that
it
never
received
the
certificate
of
insurance
or
any
other 
documents
suggesting
the
insurance
policies
needed
to
be
amended
[to
make
the
plaintiff
an 
additional
insured]. 
[T]he
insurer
argues
that
it
had
no
knowledge
of
the
certificate’s
existence
[and,
therefore,
could
not 
modify
the
policy
to
include
coverage
for
the
plaintiff
as
an
additional
insured]. 
To
illustrate
the
“blanket”
AI
endorsement
triggered
by
certificate
issuance
problem,
in
Erie
Ins.
Group
v. 
National
Grange
Mut.
Ins.
Co.
,
the
court
observed
the
following
insurance
contract
language.
78Each
of
the
following
is
added
as
an
Additional
Insured
…
[a]ny
general
contractor,
subcontractor 
or
owner
for
whom
you
are
required
to
add
as
an
additional
insured
on
this
policy
under
a
written 
construction
contract
or
agreement
where
a
certificate
of
insurance
showing
that
person
or 
organization
as
an
additional
insured
has
been
issued
and
received
by
[NGM]
prior
to
the
time
of 
loss. 
Note
that
AI
status
is
contingent
on
a
COI
being
issued
“and
received
by”
the
insurer.
The
COI
can’t
be 
received
by
the
insurer
unless
it
is
first
sent
by
the
agency.
The
safest
procedure,
from
an
E&O 
standpoint,
is
for
the
agency
to
copy
all
insurers
on
COIs 
In
addition,
this
process
can
benefit
insurers
that
can
use
at
least
a
sample
of
received
COIs
to
quality 
check
their
agents’
work
product.
For
example,
as
previously
discussed,
consider
the
following
statements 
placed
on
COIs
by
agency
staff. 
Insurer
will
provide
written
notice
of
any
reduction
of
coverage
with
reasonable
promptness. 
Insurer
agrees
to
accept
Contractor’s
choice
of
counsel. 
What
insurer
would
not
want
to
know
that
a
representative
of
its
company
was
placing
statements
like 
this
on
COIs,
regardless
of
the
presence
of
disclaimers? 
Sending
AI
Endorsements
to
AIs
Upstream
parties
often
want
the
downstream
party’s
agent
to
place
verbiage
on
a
certificate
that
they,
and 
likely
others,
are
AIs.
Sometimes,
they
may
want
this
verbiage
to
state
that
“XYZ”
is
an
AI
“as
per 
construction
contract.”
As
discussed
earlier,
many
AI
endorsements
in
the
marketplace
do
not
comply 
with
contractual
requirements. 
By
sending
AI
endorsements
to
AIs,
the
agent
puts
the
onus
on
the
AI
to
actually
read
the
form.
This
is 
supported
by
case
law
such
as
the
following. 
…
an
insured
has
a
duty
to
take
certain
steps
for
its
own
protection
such
as
reading
their
policies, 
certificates
of
insurance
or
any
cancellation
notices
in
their
possession
.
[
Emphasis

A
state
government
entity
said,
“If
an
entire
insurance
policy
was
submitted
but
not
requested,
we
shall 
not
be
obligated
to
review
the
document
and
shall
not
be
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
its
contents.” 
One
AI
insisted,
“Please
do
not
send
any
endorsements.
We
will
only
accept
certificates
with
the 
additional
insured
statement
listed
above
or
as
typed
on
the
certificate.” 
According
to
the
Alabama
Supreme
Court,
citing
various
sources,
in
Alabama
Elec.
Coop.,
Inc.,
v. 
Bailey’s
Constr.
Co.,
Inc.
30
, 
An
insured
has
a
duty
to
read
the
insurance
policy
and
is
charged
with
knowledge
of
its
provisions. 
The
Court
concludes
that
[the
client],
claiming
to
be
an
additional
“insured”
under
[the
policy], 
should
be
held
to
the
same
obligation
as
a
named
insured
to
review
a
policy
of
insurance
on
which
it 
seeks
to
rely,
and
its
reliance
solely
on
the
agent’s
certificate
of
insurance
is
not
reasonable
under 
the
circumstances…. 
Thus,
the
Court
finds
that
Plaintiffs’
reliance
upon
[the
insurance
broker’s]
representation
of
[the 
client’s]
additional
insured
status
was
not
reasonable.
Accordingly,
as
a
matter
of
law,
Plaintiffs’ 
claims
for
negligent
and
fraudulent
misrepresentation
fail. 
Couch
on
Insurance
(3d
ed.
1997)
says, 
Where
an
entity
requires
another
to
procure
insurance
naming
it
an
additional
insured,
that
party 
should
not
rely
on
a
mere
certificate
of
insurance,
but
should
insist
on
a
copy
of
the
policy. 
For
these
reasons,
E&O
experts
recommend
that,
with
the
insured’s
permission,
copies
of
applicable 
policy
forms
be
sent
to
AIs
rather
than
making
any
statements
on
a
COI
as
to
AI
status
or
coverage. 
Online
Certificate
Systems
79Businesses
sometimes
perform
work
for
or
provide
services
to
entities
that
outsource
their
certificate 
tracking
and
management
to
online
vendors.
Many
of
these
vendors
will
not
accept
ACORD
25 
certificates,
even
in
digital
form,
insisting
that
agents
enter
information
into
their
proprietary
systems. 
That
can
present
potential
business,
legal,
and
privacy
problems
for
agents
and
the
insurers
they
represent.
For
example,
one
such
system
required
the
agency
to
pay
a
fee
to
access
the
system
to
enter
or
update 
policy
information.
The
agent
also
had
to
pay
a
fee
every
time
their
insured’s
business
partner
accessed 
this
information.
In
one
case,
the
airport
authority
checked
policy
information
daily
for
a
concourse 
vendor,
and
the
vendor’s
agent
was
charged
a
fee
each
time.
The
agent
had
three
such
customers
at
the 
airport,
each
generating
daily
charges
for
the
agency.
This
was
the
business
model
for
the
online
COI 
tracking
system—provide
your
service
for
free
to
entities
and
have
the
insurance
agents
of
their
business 
partners
fund
the
service. 
A
similar
system’s
marketing
strategy
was
based
on
the
flexibility
of
the
number
of
coverage
questions 
that
could
be
required
far
beyond
the
limited
information
on
an
ACORD
25.
The
system
allowed
over 
300
possible
questions,
many
of
which
were
very
broad,
vague,
and
ambiguous.
For
example, 
•
Broad
form
contractual
(Y/N)?
•
Special
all
risk
contractual
(Y/N)?
•
Blanket
operations
(Y/N)?
•
Independent
contractors
(Y/N)?
•
Auto
pollution
liability
(Y/N)?
•
Primary
and
noncontributory
(Y/N)?
•
Severability
clause
(Y/N)?
•
Cross-liability
exclusion
(Y/N)?
•
Punitive
damages
exclusion
(Y/N)?
•
Assault
and
battery
exclusion
(Y/N)?
The
system
stored
a
scanned
signature
of
the
agent,
and
the
contract
for
the
use
of
the
system
by
the
agent 
included
several
hold
harmless
provisions
for
the
online
system
if
the
information
was
obtained
and
used 
by
others. 
Another
online
system
allowed
the
insured
to
enter
anything
desired
in
the
description
of
operations
field. 
Worse,
the
certificate
holder
could
enter
a
list
of
AIs
at
any
time
even
if
they
weren’t
actually
AIs. 
Still
another
online
system
offers
to
interface
with
agency
management
systems
to
minimize
human 
intervention
in
the
sharing
of
policy
information.
Some
agents
have
expressed
concern
about
the 
possibility
of
data
corruption
within
their
own
systems
or
the
possibility
of
a
data
breach
along
the
lines 
of
what
happened
to
Target
when
cyber
criminals
gained
access
to
Target’s
systems
through
a
vendor’s 
system. 
Again,
these
types
of
systems
and
their
complexity
impose
additional
and
potentially
significant
costs
on 
agents
in
the
time
required
to
complete
information
requirements,
including
any
double-entry
into
agency 
management
systems
to
document
these
transactions
and
possibly
direct
entry
and
access
fees.
In 
addition,
these
systems
and
their
functionality
may
enhance
an
agent’s
potential
liability
due
to
system 
complexity,
ambiguity
of
required
information,
the
ability
of
unauthorized
entities
to
access
or
even 
modify
entered
data,
privacy
concerns,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
assurance
that
the
online
vendor
will 
still
be
in
business
if
the
entered
information
is
needed. 
As
a
result,
many
agencies
refuse
to
use
these
systems,
some
going
as
far
as
giving
up
customers
as
a 
result.
Other
agencies
may
be
able
to
negotiate
more
favorable
terms.
Still
other
agencies
simply
accept 
this
as
a
business
risk. 
80Agency
Procedures
and
Caveats
The
COI
process
today
is
far
more
complicated
and
prone
to
professional
liability
claims
than
in
years 
past.
No
longer
is
it
advisable
to
employ
purely
clerical
staff
to
oversee
this
operation.
Agency
staff
must 
be
properly
trained
and
supervised,
and
management
should
have
an
effective
quality
control
program
in 
place.
Do
not
engage
in
contract
review
without
the
proper
trained
and
experienced
personnel,
and
do
so 
only
with
disclaimers,
as
discussed
earlier
in
this
course. 
Specific
certificate
procedures
should
be
implemented
on
an
“invariable
practice”
basis.
“Invariable 
practice”
means
“one
way,
all
the
time,
by
everyone”
in
the
agency.
Agencies
should
consider 
incorporating,
at
least
by
reference,
ACORD’s
Forms
Instruction
Guides
into
their
procedures
manual. 
In
addition
to
internal
education
of
staff
members,
agencies
are
encouraged
to
actively
engage
in
external 
education
of
customers
and,
when
warranted,
their
business
partners.
For
example,
a
government
entity 
wanted
a
contractor’s
CGL
language
amended
by
the
agent,
advising
that
“I
received
a
communication 
from
you
today
telling
me
that
you
don’t
have
the
authority
to
alter
insurance
company
forms.
As
their 
agent,
why
not?”
This
is
clearly
an
individual
who
knows
little
about
the
insurance
industry
and
its 
regulatory
constraints.
While
it’s
frustrating
to
deal
with
issues
like
this,
one
might
view
this
as
an 
opportunity
to
educate. 
All
agency
staff
members
should
be
aware
of
the
agency/company
agreements,
underwriting
guidelines, 
and
related
documents
and
procedures
of
all
insurers
represented
by
the
agency.
This
should
be
kept
up
to 
date
and
communicated
as
needed. 
ACORD
forms
should
always
be
used
with
rare
exceptions.
If
exceptions
are
made,
do
not
issue 
non-ACORD
forms
without
clearance
from
the
insurer(s)
involved. 
Never
modify
the
preprinted
text
of
an
ACORD
form,
especially
the
disclaimers,
and
minimize
the
use
of 
extraneous
descriptive,
contractual,
or
potentially
misrepresentative
language
on
the
ACORD
form.
If
you 
must
add
verbiage
to
an
ACORD
form,
carefully
review
what
you
said
and
how
it
might
be
interpreted 
and
then
modify
as
warranted. 
Proofread
certificates
and
perform
quality
control
checks
on
completed
COIs. 
The
Future
Some
businesses
and
government
entities
have
discontinued
asking
for
COIs.
They
still
require
vendors 
to
obtain
and
maintain
the
appropriate
insurance.
Instead
of
using
a
COI
to
assist
in
pursuing
third
parties 
as
part
of
subrogation
recovery,
they
rely
on
the
vendor
contract’s
insurance
and
indemnification 
requirements.
Unfortunately,
from
the
agent’s
perspective,
these
decisions
have
been
made
by
a
tiny 
minority
of
entities. 
Some
industry
commentators
suggest
that,
given
the
billions
of
dollars
invested
by
all
parties
in
the 
insurance
certification
process,
more
elementary
means
be
used
such
as
memoranda
of
insurance
or
even 
documentation
approaching
that
of
auto
insurance
cards. 
In
the
long
run,
the
technology
exists
to
access
necessary
information
directly
from
insurers,
although 
security
and
privacy
issues
will
have
to
be
addressed.
Emerging
technologies
like
blockchain
may
prove 
to
be
the
most
effective
approach.
In
the
meantime,
hopefully,
the
ideas
and
suggestions
provided
in
this 
course
will
help
agents
and
others
address
some
of
the
issues
they
currently
face
on
a
daily
basis. 
Summary
Information
sometimes
requested
of
agents
may
be
considered
unreasonable,
improper,
impossible,
or 
even
illegal.
Agents
need
to
be
aware
of
the
types
of
demands
and
information
sometimes
requested
and 
why
compliance
with
these
requests
may
increase
their
E&O
exposure.
This
concluding
chapter
provided 
dozens
of
examples
of
specific
requests
and
related
issues
of
which
agents
and
others
should
be
aware
in 
their
efforts
to
be
as
accommodating
as
possible
to
their
customers’
business
partners,
while
minimizing 
the
agency’s
E&O
exposure
and
bottom
line.
