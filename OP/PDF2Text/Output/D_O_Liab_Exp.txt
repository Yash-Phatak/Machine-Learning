 1 Chapter 1 
Introduction and Course Overview 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This Web CE course is designed to give a moderately experienced insurance person a detailed look at 
the legal liability exposures faced by the directors and officers of for-profit, publicly-held 
corporations. The major areas this course addresse s include: (1) the common law and statutory legal 
liability exposures to which the directors and officer s of publicly-held corporations are subject, (2) 
legal defenses available to directors and officers wh en a claim is made against them, (3) the types of 
situations that give rise to these claims, (4) the f actors that insurers consider when underwriting D&O 
policies for publicly-held companies, and (5) the most effective methods of preventing and 
controlling claims against corporate directors and officers. 
The course is arranged as follows. 
• Chapter 2 describes the general nature of corporations and discusses the functions that 
directors and officers perform within corporations. 
• Chapter 3 sets forth the common law duties owed by directors and officers to the corporations 
they serve. These duties, collectively known as “f iduciary duties,” include (1) loyalty, (2) 
obedience, and (3) due care.  
• Chapter 4 discusses the liability exposures of directors and officers under federal securities 
laws, the single, greatest exposure faced by directors and officers of publicly-traded corporations. 
• Chapter 5 discusses the numerous, federal statutes—that are not related to securities liability 
laws— that can also form the basis for claims against corporate directors and officers. 
• Chapter 6 sets forth the most common defenses available to corporate directors when claims 
are made against them.  
• Chapter 7 explains the nature of securities cla ss action claims, which are by far the costliest 
type of litigation to which corporate directors and officers are exposed.  
• Chapter 8 examines four major sources of securities class action claims, commonly brought against corporate directors and officers. These include claims from financial restatements, initial public offerings (IPOs), change-of-control situations, a nd stock option backdating.  
• Chapter 9 discusses four additional types of securities class action claims made against directors and officers of corporations. These include claims associated with (1) auction rate securities, (2) subprime lending, (3) private equity operations, and (4) the Bernard Madoff 
investment Ponzi scheme. Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
2 • Chapter 10 explains the nature of what are know n as “parallel proceedings.” Such claims are 
related to, but legally separate from, the cl ass action claims from which they originated. 
These proceedings include (1) derivative claims , (2) opt-out claims, (3) ERISA stock-drop 
claims, and (4) regulatory and criminal proceedings. 
• Chapter 11 looks at two of the four major f actors that D&O underwriters consider when 
evaluating and pricing a D&O policy: the corporation’s financial situation and its competitive 
position within the particular i ndustry in which it does business.  
• Chapter 12 examines the next two critical areas considered by D&O underwriters: factors particular to the individual corporation being evaluated and the composition and operation of 
its board of directors. 
• Chapter 13 is the first of two chapters that discusses methods of preventing and controlling 
claims against corporate directors and officers. This chapter provides what can be considered 
“general” methods of loss control. 
• Chapter 14, the second of two chapters addressing D&O loss control and prevention, focuses 
on corporate governance, explaining how th e actual composition and functioning of a 
corporate board can be improved, which will ultimately reduce a company’s exposure to 
claims. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Explain the general nature and purpose of cor porations and identify the functions served by 
directors and officers within corporations.  
2. Discuss the three key common law duties that directors and officers owe to corporations.  
3. Describe the major federal securities laws which can give rise to director and officer liability. 
4. State and illustrate the most important statutes (other than those pertaining to securities 
liability) that can subject directors and officers to claims. 
5. Analyze the most important legal defenses that directors and officers have available to them 
when claims are asserted against them. 
6. Describe the essential nature of securities class action claims.  
7. Define and analyze the major sources of securities class action claims against directors and 
officers, including claims from: financial r estatements, initial public offerings (IPOs), 
change-of-control situations, stock option backdating, auction rate securities, subprime 
lending, the Bernard Madoff investment Ponz i scheme, and private equity operations. 
8. Analyze the various types of parallel proceedi ngs, including derivative, op-out, ERISA stock 
drop claims, and regulatory/criminal proceedings.  
9. List and provide details concerning the four  major underwriting factors considered by 
insurers in underwriting a nd pricing D&O coverage.  
10. List and discuss the so-called “general  methods” of preventing D&O claims.  
11. Provide examples of and discuss the various met hods of controlling D&O losses that pertain 
to corporate governance. 
 3 Chapter 2 
The Corporation and the Functions of Directors & Officers 
This chapter analyzes the general nature of corpor ations, discusses the roles that directors and officers 
play within them, and explains the nature of the duties that they owe to the corporation. 
What is a Corporation? 
A corporation is an “artificial person,” created under the laws of a given state. This means that a 
corporation has an identity and existence distinct a nd independent from that of  its individual owners.  
Corporations have the power to (1) act; (2) contract; (3) sue/be sued; and to (4) own, manage, and 
buy/sell property.  
The profits (and losses) of the corporation are distri buted according to the ownership interest (i.e., the 
percentage of total shares) owned by each shareholder.  
The Defining Feature of a Corporati on: Limited Liability of Individual 
Shareholders 
The defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the people who create it—
meaning that if a corporation fails, shareholders only stand to lose their i nvestment in the company 
(i.e., the amount of money they paid for shares of stock in the company), but will not be liable for any 
remaining debts owed to the corporation's creditors. For example, an investor purchases $100,000 of stock in XYZ Company. A year later, XYZ Company declares bankruptcy. After the bankruptcy court liquidates all of XYZ’s assets, it is determined that  XYZ still owes its creditors a total of $5 million. 
Although the investor’s $100,000 in vestment is now worthless, he is not liable for any of XYZ’s 
remaining $5 million in debts. 
Chartering of Corporations 
Corporations are chartered by all 50 of the United States and by the federal government in certain instances. For example, national banks and thrift (i .e., savings and loan institutions) are federally 
chartered.  
Public versus Private Corporations 
Public corporations are corporations whose shares of stock are held by and can be purchased by 
members of the public. In contrast, privately-held corporations are those whose shares cannot be 
purchased by the public. Rather, the shares of private companies tend to be held by a small group of Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
4 persons, often, although not always, family member s. As a result, public companies are generally 
much larger than private companies. 
The shares of public companies can be bought or so ld on one of the major stock exchanges, such as 
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated 
Quotations (NASDAQ). Conversely, the shares of private corporations are not traded on any of the major stock exchanges, because they ar e not available for sale to the public. 
The directors and officers of private corporations are exposed to liability for their actions on behalf of the corporations they serve. However, the extent of  such liability is considerably less than that of 
persons who serve as directors and officers of public  corporations. Therefore, this course will focus 
on the distinctive liability exposure aspects of public—rather than private company—directors and officers. 
The Functions of Directors and Officers  
Management of a corporation is entrusted to its bo ard of directors, the members of which are elected 
by the shareholders. The shareholders' responsibility for the corporation's management is limited to 
(1) electing the directors who serve on the board and (2) approving extraordinary matters put before them by the board, such as a proposal to sell th e corporation's assets to another corporation. 
Specific Functions of Corporate Directors 
Corporate directors must ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders' best interest. The 
directors are responsible for determining the corporation's business strategy and for appointing and supervising officers to execute that strategy.  
Corporate Directors: The Link between Shareholder s and Management 
Because they appoint and supervise the corporate officers who carry out the day-to-day management of the corporation, the directors serve as a link between shareholders and management. 
Specific Responsibilities 
In supervising the management of the corpora tion's business, directors are responsible for the 
following specific items: 
• establishing and reviewing major policies and procedures;  
• evaluating management's performance;  
• determining appropriate co mpensation for management; 
• identifying and recruiting potential board members and management personnel;  
• reviewing the financial status of the corporation;  
• preparing and submitting information about the corporation and its financial condition to 
shareholders and government regulators;  
• monitoring and authorizing securities (i.e., stock) transactions (including public offerings of 
the company’s stock); and  
• ensuring that the corporation is in compliance with the numerous federal and state laws and 
regulations that govern various aspects of the corporation's activities. Chapter 2—The Corporation and the Functions of Directors & Officers 
5 Inside versus Outside Directors 
Most publicly-traded corporations have a board of di rectors that include some (but not necessarily all) 
of the corporation's top executive officers (known as “inside directors”). For ex ample, a corporation’s 
chief executive officer (CEO), chief operating offi cer (COO), and chief financial officer (CFO) are 
nearly always members of the corporation’s board of directors. However, the corporation’s chief 
counsel (i.e., chief legal officer) and comptroller (i .e., chief accounting officer), while almost always 
officers of the company, are not always members of its board of directors.  
In addition to these “inside” directors are persons who are not otherwise affiliated with or employed 
by the corporation, but may have special qualificatio ns and expertise that is valuable in managing the 
company. Such persons are known as “outside directors.” 
Board Committees 
Boards of directors usually form a handful of what are known as “committees.” These committees, which normally consist of two to four members of  the board, are formed for the purpose of addressing 
a particular aspect or feature of the corporation.  Like the entire board of directors, such committees 
also meet periodically to discuss matters relevant to the particular subject of their committee. Three of 
the most common board committees and their responsibilities are: 
• Audit (overseeing the company’s financial, accounti ng, internal and external audit functions); 
• Nominating (identifying and recruiting new/a dditional board members and officers); and 
• Compensation (recommending appropriate compensation levels for the company’s management, as well as compensation for members of the board).

Common Law Duties of Directors & Officers 
The legal principles enunciated in opinions written by  judges and issued by the courts (as distinct 
from laws contained in legislative enactments known as statutory law) are often referred to 
collectively as “caselaw” or the “common law.” Many of the claims made against directors and 
officers are based on legal principles embodied in the common law, especially as respects the four 
key duties of (1) loyalty, (2) obedience, (3) due care, and (4) good faith, all of which are owed by 
directors and officers to the corporations they serve. These are collectively known as directors’ and 
officers’ “fiduciary duties” and ar e discussed in this chapter.  
The Four Fiduciary Duties 
The four fiduciary duties owed by directors and offi cers are the duties of loyalty, obedience, due care, 
and good faith. 
The Duty of Loyalty 
According to the Corporate Director’s Guidebook , the duty of loyalty requires that directors and 
officers act with “an undivided and unselfish loyalty to the corporation.” 
Although the courts recognize that there may be a certain degree of self-interest involved in board 
decisions, the duty of loyalty requires that directors’  self-interest be minimal and that the interests of 
the corporation and its shareholde rs take precedence over the direct ors’ desire to maintain their 
positions. Therefore, directors must ensure that boa rd actions are designed to benefit the corporation 
as a whole—rather than themselves. 
Examples of Breaches of  the Duty of Loyalty 
Examples of conduct by directors and officers that has been found to constitute a breach of the duty 
of loyalty are noted in Exhibit 3.1. 
  
 
  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
8 Exhibit 3.1 
Breaches of the Duty of Loyalty  
Revealing inside information or disclosing trade secrets of the corporation to outsiders (e.g., 
advising a stock tr ader that the company w ill be announcing the introdu ction of a major new 
drug, knowing that the firm’s share price is likel y to rise when such information becomes public 
knowledge).  
Appropriating a corporate opportuni ty for personal gain or competin g with the corporation (e.g., 
obtaining a “fire sale” price on assets that the corporation is selling, rather than offering such 
assets on the open market). Soliciting the corporation's business or customers a fter the director or officer leaves the service 
of the corporation (e.g., after retiring from the board, a director, who by means of his 
association with the company, makes sales calls  on behalf of his own company, to all of the 
corporation’s purchasing managers). 
Authorizing loans of corporate funds to themselves  or to associates, on preferential terms (e.g., 
having a bank director obtain a home mortgage l oan at a rate that is 3 percent below the 
bank’s regular rate for that type of loan). Authorizing or receiving improper payments or gratuities from persons engaged in business 
transactions with the corporation (e.g., arranging for the corporation to pay bribes to foreign 
officials, as a condition of doing business in their country). 
Using corporate assets to entrench the board in control of the corporation, such as where 
corporate funds are used to purchase stock to maintain a voting majority (e.g., convincing the 
company’s CEO to raise funds for the organization by selling shares of stock to the company’s 
directors, rather than through a public offering of stock).  
 
Directors and officers who seek to benefit themselves at the corporation's expense have breached their duty of loyalty to the corporation and may be held  personally liable for any damage suffered by the 
corporation as a result. For example, in Guth v. Loft, Inc.,  5 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. Ch. 1939),
 the 
president of a corporation that manufactured syrups was found to have breached his duty of loyalty to the corporation when he personally  acquired the trademark and formula of Pepsi Cola and a 91 
percent interest in the Pepsi Cola Company by using corporate funds, facilities, and labor to operate the acquired business. The president's use of cor porate assets to personally acquire a corporate 
business opportunity violated his duty of loyalty to the corporation. 
The Duty of Obedience 
The duty of obedience relates to directors’ and offi cers’ responsibility for assuring that their personal 
conduct conforms to applicable law. Adherence to  the duty of obedience also obligates directors to 
limit their corporation’s conduct to the powers c onferred on the corporation by its charter and as 
imposed by law. “Law” includes not only the common  law and statutes of the state of incorporation, 
but also federal and state statutes, rules, and regula tions that control their duties and the corporation's 
activities.  
Ultra Vires Acts 
Acts that are beyond the powers conferred upon a corpor ation by its charter or by the laws of its state 
of incorporation are termed ultra vires . (A charter is a document filed with the state by the founders 
of a corporation, which describes the purpose, location, and other details pertaining to the 
organization.)   Chapter 3—Common Law Duti es of Directors & Officers 
9 Directors are not only liable for their own ultra vires  acts but are also liable for ultra vires  acts 
authorized by the board as a whole. (For example, if  the corporation’s charter bans loans to directors 
and officers, the granting of such a loan would constitute an ultra vires  act.) Moreover, directors and 
officers do not enjoy immunity simply because their c onduct is in the capacity as a director or officer; 
if their conduct is illegal, they can also be personally accountable, meaning that their personal assets 
can be appropriated in a lawsuit.  
Personal Exposures to Direc tors & Officers Liability 
Although claims against directors and officers for breaching the duty of obedience have received 
increased attention over the last quarter century, they historically have not implicated the personal assets of the defendant directors and officers. In virtually all cases, either the company's insurer or the 
corporation indemnified the defendant directors and officers. However, in the past decade, there have 
been cases where insurance coverage and corporate indemnification (i.e., the corporation paying, on 
the director’s behalf, for liability the director in curred while serving the company) were unavailable. 
In such cases, especially where the alleged wrongdoing was abnormally egregious, directors and 
officers were forced to personally pay settlements or judgments from their own assets.  
Recent Settlements 
In today's environment, directors and officers can no longer feel safe from threats of personal liability 
exposure, even under the most comprehensive insu rance program. As evidenced by some recent well-
publicized settlements, institutional plaintiffs (e.g., pension funds, banks) and, in some cases, government regulators are demanding unprecedented pe rsonal contributions from directors to settle 
certain large securities claims. For example, the directors of Enron paid a total of $13 million from 
their own assets, and the directors of WorldCom pa id a total of $24.75 million out of their own assets 
to claims against them and their corporations. Most recently, in 2007, five former directors of Just for 
Feet paid a total of $41.5 million in conjunction w ith their service at the company, an amount that 
exceeded the combined Enron and WorldCom directo r-funded settlements. (In this case, the plaintiffs 
alleged massive accounting irregularities in conjunctio n with the firm’s financial statements that 
vastly overstated the company’s financial results, in cluding booking unearned receivables as income.)  
In other cases, plaintiffs have settled with only some of the individual defendant directors/officers for 
the entire amount of the available insurance,  thereby leaving the remaining defendant 
directors/officers uninsured. When combined with the explosion in the size of claim settlements in 
recent years, these developments are extremely alarming even for the most scrupulous director or 
officer. 
The Duty of Due Care (also Known as the Duty of “Due Diligence”) 
The duty of due care requires that directors a nd officers make decisions based upon reasonably 
adequate information and deliberation. The adequacy  of such deliberative processes, as distinct from 
the result of their deliberative process, is the focus of the duty of care.  
What Constitutes “Due Care”? 
Directors and officers must discharge their duties with  the care that an ordinarily prudent person, in a 
like position, would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner they reasonably believe is 
in the best interest of the corporation. The duty of care also requires that directors attend board 
meetings, obtain and adequately review informa tion concerning actions taken by the board, and 
carefully supervise the corporation's business and its major policies.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
10 The Two Settings Involving the Duty of Due Care 
Director/officer liability for a breach of the duty to exercise due care typically arises in one of two 
settings.  
Poor Decision-Making 
With respect to a board decision that leads to a co rporate loss, compliance with a director's duty of 
care focuses on the good faith or rationality of the process employed in ma king the challenged board 
decision, not the result of the decision. For instance, Corporation A decides to purchase Corporation 
B. The decision was made following extensive discu ssions at three board meetings and was a product 
of 500 hours of analysis by Corporation A’s internal staff. In addition, the board hired an investment 
banking firm to determine a fair price for the acquis ition. If, a year later, it turns out to have been a 
poor decision because Corporation B’s operations ar e unprofitable, the directors will not be held 
liable for violating the duty of due care because it took reasonable measures and performed a thorough evaluation, prior to making th e decision to purchase Corporation B. 
Failure To Make a Decision 
With respect to board inaction that leads to a cor porate loss, compliance with a director's duty of care 
focuses on whether the director attempted in good fait h to assure that the corporation had in place an 
effective information and reporting system to ensu re corporate compliance with legal requirements. 
For instance, assume that Corporation A offered Corporation B an opportunity to purchase certain 
assets of Corporation A and Corporation B did not even bother to evaluate or respond to the offer. In 
this instance, the directors and officers of Corporation B could be held liable for breaching the duty of due care, given their lack of effort in failing to even review B’s offer. 
The Duty of Good Faith: An Emerging Fiduciary Duty  
In recent years, a fourth common law duty has be gun to emerge, known as the duty of good faith. 
This doctrine was introduced in a case known as In re Walt Disney Derivative Litigation,  907 A.2d 
693, 755 (Del. Ch. 2005), and is discussed later in this course under “A Notable Derivative Claim” in 
Chapter 10. In this case, the court found that in a ddition to the three traditional duties, directors and 
officers also have a duty to act in good faith. In the court’s opinion, the failure to act in good faith can 
create liability for directors and officers in conjunctio n with their service to the corporation. However, 
in this case, the judges ultimately ruled that despite the plaintiffs’ allegations to the contrary, the directors and officers, had, in fact, acted in good faith and were therefore not liable for the damages 
claimed by the plaintiffs.

Federal Securities Liability 
Chapter 4 discusses the liability expo sures of directors and officers under federal securities laws—the 
single, greatest exposure faced by directors and officers of publicly-traded corporations. 
The Securities Act of 1933 
The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to en sure the availability of complete and reliable 
information about securities being sold to the public. The two most important components of the Act 
are Sections 5 and 11.  
Liability under Section 5: The Oblig ation To Register a New Security 
Section 5 makes it illegal to offer or sell securities to the public unless they have first been registered 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC ). For example, if a corporation seeks to sell 
stock to the public, it must first register the stock with the SEC. The purpose of this requirement is to 
assure that the corporation and its securities will be evaluated by a neutral party that can determine 
whether or not the corporation is worthy of an investment.  
Liability under Section 11: The Obligati on To Make Truthful  Statements about 
Securities 
Section 11 imposes civil liability for material misstate ments in registration statements. (A “material” 
misstatement refers to a major falsification, compared to a less important one. For example, 
intentionally inflating a company’s quarterly earnings by 25 percent would be a material 
misstatement; doing so by 1 percent would not.) Fa ilure to comply with the Act's technical or 
substantive requirements in connection with a public  offering of stock can result in liability of the 
corporation and its directors and officers. For example, assume that a corporation issues a prospectus 
to induce investors to buy stock in the organization. If it is determined that the prospectus contained 
deliberately false information, the corporation and its directors and officers could be held liable for 
violating Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.  
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
In contrast to the Securities Act of 1933, which applies to the issuance of new shares of stock in a 
corporation, The Securities and Exchange Act of 193 4 was enacted to protect investors in connection 
with the trading of securities already  issued and outstanding. The primary goal of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 is to ensure that persons involved in securities transactions have reasonably equal access to material information about the transactions and the securities. The most important components of the Act are Section 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b-5, known as the anti-fraud provisions.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
14 Liability under Section 10(b): The Prohibition against Deceptive 
Acts/Statements 
This section of the law prohibits manipulative or deceptive acts in connection with the purchase or 
sale of a security. Such provisions would apply in the following situation. Assume a corporation 
issues financial statements that materially misrepre sent the true financial condition of the company. 
Such statements indicate that the company earned a substantial profit in the just-ended fiscal year, yet 
in reality, it sustained a severe loss. As a result of  such statements, investors claim that they were 
induced to buy stock in the corporation. The shares of stock plummet in value during the next month. 
Under this scenario, the corporation and its director s and officers could be held liable for violating 
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Liability under Section 10b-5: The Pr ohibition against “Insider Trading” 
This section of the law applies to what is known as “insider trading” in the shares of stock in a 
corporation. Insider trading is the trading of a corporation’s stock or other securities, such as bonds, 
by persons with access to non-public information (also referred to as asymmetrical knowledge ) about 
the company.  
Here is an example of insider trading, which woul d be prohibited under Section 10b-5. Assume that a 
corporate director or officer knew that the company was about to announce a substantial loss for the 
just-concluded fiscal quarter. Prior to a public anno uncement of these financial results, the director 
sold the 500,000 shares of stock that he owned in  the company. This pre-announcement sale allowed 
the director to avoid a considerable personal loss, given the fact that prior to the announcement, the 
company’s stock was selling at $30 per share, yet following the disclosure, the market price plunged 
to $10 per share.  
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
Following the revelation of massive corporate improprieties, including accounting irregularities, 
scandals, and fraud of unprecedented scale and sev erity, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002. More specifically, the Act was a response to the excesses associat ed with the Enron, 
WorldCom, Adelphia, Global Crossing bankruptcies (and others), as well as from the implosion of 
the stocks in a number of high-tech companies during the period of 2000 to 2002.  
The Act addresses several areas of national concer n regarding corporate accounting and auditing, 
fraud, corporate transparency, and officer liability. The most important provisions are noted in 
Exhibit 4.1. 
     
 
    Chapter 4—Federal Securities Liability 
15 Exhibit 4.1 
Key Provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  
• Independent Accounting Board . The Act created an independent accounting board  
to oversee corporate accounting and auditing practices.  
• Personal Certification of Financial Statements . The Act included a requirement that 
chief executive officers and chief fi nancial officers of public companies personally 
participate  in preparing the firm’s financial statements and personally certifying the 
accuracy of such statements.  
• Internal Control Report . The Act requires that an internal control report be included in 
a public company's annual report and that the company's public accountant must attest 
to management's assessment of the com pany's internal control structures.  
• Ban on Loans . The Act bans corporate loans  to directors and officers, except in 
certain limited circumstances.  
• Insider Trading . The Act requires that insider trades (i.e., those by directors and 
officers),  be reported to the SEC more quickly than was previously required. 
• Audit Committee Reform . The Act requires that audit committees  be composed 
entirely of independent  directors and that members of audit committees be 
experienced and well-versed on financial issues.  
• Penalties for Material Misstatements . The Act requires CEOs and CFOs to forfeit 
bonus and equity compensation,  in the event of a material restatement of a company's 
financial statements. (A financial restatem ent is issued when a corporation must 
provide to the public and the SEC, a comple tely new set of financial data, because 
there has been a substantial erro r in the original statements.)  
• Whistleblower Protection.  The Act provides for criminal penalties against 
corporations that retaliate against whistleblowers who reveal conduct by officials at the 
company. Such penalties apply regardless of whether the company’s stock is publicly traded.

Liability under Other Types of Statutes 
While more than half of all claims against directors and officers are based on either violations of 
securities or employment-related laws, a substantial number of claims against directors and officers are also brought under statutes prohibiting various other types of conduct. Such statutes are noted in 
Exhibit 5.1 below, and a number of the more  important ones are discussed in Chapter 5.

Liability for Anticompetitive and Unfair Business Practices 
The federal prohibition against anticompetitive bus iness practices is principally embodied in two 
“antitrust” statutes, the Sherman Act and the Clayt on Act, violation of which can subject corporate 
directors and officers to liability. The Sherman Act pr ohibits contracts, combinations (i.e., groups of 
companies, also sometimes referred to as cartels), and conspiracies in restraint of trade, monopolies, 
and attempts and conspiracies to monopolize. Th e Clayton Act prohibits price discrimination among 
purchasers of goods, exclusive dealing arrangements,  and corporate mergers and acquisitions that 
may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.  
Predatory Price-Cutting Activities  
The Robinson-Patman Act imposes both civil and cr iminal penalties for predatory price-cutting and 
other actions taken to eliminate competition. The Federal Trade Commission Act also prohibits other 
unfair or deceptive methods of competition.  
Disclosure of Trade Secrets  
Trade secrets are protected by common law and by federal statute. The Uniform Trade Secret Act 
codifies common law principles of liability for improper disclosure of trade secrets. The Act prohibits 
misappropriation of confidential business or technological information by any means, including 
hiring another company's employee with the expectation that the employee will divulge or use the trade secrets of the former company in his or her new position.  Chapter 5—Liability under Other Types of Statutes 
19 Liability for Copyright/Patent/Trademark Infringement 
Federal registration requirements protect owners of copyrights, patents, and trademarks, from 
infringement by others. 
Copyright/Patent Infringement 
The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right  to reproduce the work, prepare derivative (i.e., 
similar) works, distribute copies of the work, and to  perform and display the work. Violation of such 
rights may result in liability for infringement. Similarl y, anyone who makes, uses, or sells a patented 
product without authorization from the patent holder may be held liable in damages for infringement 
of the patent. 
Trademark Infringement 
Trademarks are protected from unauthorized use by federal (i.e., the Lanham Act) and state statutory 
and common law. A trademark is infringed when there is a likelihood of confusion between two 
products caused by similar marks such that a typical consumer exercising ordinary caution would 
think that the products derive from the same source.  
To illustrate, a director or officer may be held pe rsonally liable for patent, copyright, or trademark 
infringement by a corporation. For example, in Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Branded Apparel 
Merchandising, Inc. , 592 F. Supp. 648 (D. Mass. 1984),  the court found the corporation's president 
personally liable for the corporation's trademar k infringement because he was the moving force 
behind the sales of the merchandise that infringed the plaintiff's trademark. 
Liability for Racketeering Activities 
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizati ons (RICO) Act prohibits any person, including 
corporations and their individual directors and offi cers, from conducting the affairs of any enterprise 
through a “pattern of racketeering activity” or from acquiring an enterprise through conduct 
constituting such activity. A “pattern of rack eteering activity” is established by showing the 
commission of at least two enumerated acts within a 10-year period. Examples of acts that would constitute racketeering include securities fraud, mail fraud, bankruptcy fraud, obstruction of justice, 
and embezzlement from pension, welf are, and union funds, among others. 
Treble Damage Provisions  
In addition to its criminal penalties, RICO creates a civil cause of action that enables a person injured 
by a RICO violation to recover treble damages as we ll as costs and attorneys’ fees. For example, if a 
plaintiff suffered $1 million in losses that qualified as a “pattern of racketeering,” under the treble 
damages provision he/she could potentially coll ect three times this amount, or $3 million.

20 Liability for Mismanagement of Investment Company Funds 
The Investment Company Act of 1940 protects holders of shares in investment companies (i.e., 
corporations formed to invest in the securities of other corporations, such as mutual funds) by 
imposing fiduciary duties on the managers and advisers of investment companies. Investment 
companies are organized and managed by an investment adviser that provides services to the company, in exchange for fees. The Act imposes a fiduciary duty on the both the investment adviser 
and the investment company, requiring that they  charge reasonable compensation for their services. 
The SEC and mutual fund shareholders may sue investment company directors for damages if they breach this duty by charging excessive fees.  
Liability for Mismanagement of Employee Benefit Plans  
“Fiduciaries” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 are defined as “any person who exercises any discretionary authorit y or control with respect to the management or 
administration of the plan or its assets.” In this instance, “the plan” refers to employee benefit 
programs such as pension plans, 401(k) programs, or group health insurance coverage offered by an 
employer. 
In recent years, directors and officers, even t hough they may have no day-to-day responsibilities for 
managing employee benefit programs, are, increasingly being held liable for mismanagement of such 
plans. The bases for asserting liability are that di rectors/officers: (1) negligently selected the 
fiduciaries who do have that responsibility, and that they had (2) an ongoing responsibility to monitor 
the fiduciaries they selected, which they failed to do. So-called “ERISA stock drop litigation” 
(discussed later in this course), is an example of th e claims to which directors and officers are subject, 
in conjunction with employee benefit programs.  
Liability for Failure To Coll ect and Remit Payroll Taxes 
The Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) requires employers to withhold federal income and social 
security taxes from their employees' wages. Th e Code imposes personal liability on “responsible 
persons” if the business does not collect or pay ov er these taxes to the IRS. Most cases against 
individual directors and officers turn on whether such individual is a “responsible person” under the Act—usually defined as someone who has signifi cant control over the company’s finances.  
Liability for Political Contributions  
The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, better known as the McCain–Feingold Act, regulates 
the financing of political campaigns. Even though corporations may not make contributions in connection with federal elections, they may estab lish what are known as “political action committees” 
(PACs), which are permitted to raise voluntary contri butions from a “restricted” class of individuals. 
This class consists of managerial employees and st ockholders, and their families. These funds may be 
used to support federal candidates and political committees, either through independent expenditures or through contributions to candidates. A PAC is limited to a maximum contribution of $5,000 to a 
candidate committee. Directors and officers are e xposed to liability for violation of the McCain-
Feingold Act in conjunction with campai gn funding activities of the corporation. 
Liability for Safety Violations  
Under certain circumstances, directors and officers may be held liable as “employers” for violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Admini stration Act (OSHA). OSHA imposes two important Chapter 5—Liability under Other Types of Statutes 
21 duties on “employers.” First, employers have a general duty to provide a working environment that is 
free from hazards likely to cause serious harm, or ev en death, to employees. Second, employers must 
comply with specific occupational safety and health standards promulgated under the Act.  
Environmental Liability 
An emerging area of potential liability for corporate directors and officers relates to compliance with 
increasingly comprehensive environmental laws. Co rporations have long been held liable for 
improper dispersal, handling, or disposal of materials harmful to the environment. Now, directors and officers may also be subject to personal liability. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Res ponse Compensation and Liability Act  
The Comprehensive Environmental Response Comp ensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) affects 
owners or operators of facilities that have relea sed hazardous substances into the environment. Also 
known as the “Superfund Act,” CERCLA establishes the means by which the government and private 
parties may bring suit to recover cleanup costs from those responsible for environmental damage. In 
United States v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Co., 810 F.2d 726, 743 (8th Cir. 1986), 
cert. denied, 484 U.S. 848 (1987), the Eighth Circuit found individual officers liable for a corporation's release of pollutants where the officers had the power to control and direct the disposal 
of the pollutants. The individuals were held pe rsonally liable for cleanup costs not because of their 
status as corporate officers, but because of their personal involvement with the CERCLA violations, 
including the arrangement for transportation and di sposal of hazardous substances on behalf of the 
corporation. 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) establishes a comprehensive hazardous waste 
management system. The Act imposes “cradle to grave” regulation over the generation, 
transportation, and disposal of hazardous waste. Ther efore, owners and operators that treat, store, and 
dispose of hazardous waste must keep and maintain detailed records regarding handling of the waste. 
The government may institute criminal actions for violations of this law, and both the government and private citizens may bring civil actions. 
Liability in Connection with  Government Contracts  
In 1986, the False Claims Act was amended to create a new D&O exposure for treble damages in 
claims against directors and officers. The 1986 amen dments to the False Claims Act permit private 
citizens to bring what are known as qui tam  suits on behalf of the U.S. government against anyone 
defrauding the U.S. government. Among other things , the 1986 amendments provide for: (1) the 
recovery of treble damages, (2) the reimbursement to the private citizen of reasonable attorneys' fees 
and costs, and (3) the guaranteed payment to the priv ate citizen of at least 15 percent of any judgment 
or settlement recovered by the government if the Depa rtment of Justice participates in the case, or (4) 
25–30 percent if the Department of Justice does not participate. 
Any company doing business with the U.S. govern ment has potential exposure under the Act. For 
example, companies that obtain government loans or loan guarantees, participate in federal grant 
programs, receive farm subsidies, obtain federa l entitlements, receive Medicaid or Medicare claim 
payments, or otherwise perform contract or subcontract work on government projects are potential qui tam  targets.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
22 Case-in-point: in June 1991, Northrop Corporation agreed to pay almost $9 million to settle a qui tam  
suit brought by two former employees who alleged that the company had defrauded the government 
by falsifying test results regarding air-launched cruise missiles. 
Liability in Connection with Br ibery of Foreign Officials 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act imposes criminal  liability on directors and officers for illegal 
payments to foreign officials. For example, th e Minister of Trade in Country A may demand an 
annual $50,000 payment from Corporation X, in retu rn for allowing the Corporation to ship its 
products into Country A. The law also mandates th at corporations maintain detailed records of 
payments to foreign officials. Accordingly, cour ts have held directors and officers liable for the 
corporation's failure to properly maintain such records.  
Liability in Connection with  Employment Laws  
Employment-related claims are one of the fastest growing areas of litigation and an increasing source 
of claims against corporate directors and officers. In fact, such claims comprise around 20 percent of 
all lawsuits filed against directors and officers a nd include allegations that directors and officers 
violated laws prohibiting: discrimination, wrongful  termination, sexual har assment, retaliation, and 
other employment-specific acts. Employment-related claims, do, however, constitute a much smaller 
exposure from a severity standpoint, comprising far l ess than 5 percent of the total dollar value of 
director and officer liability claim payments. 
Although the trend is moving away from holding dir ectors and officers personally liable under most 
federal antidiscrimination legisla tion, some federal laws and cour ts still impose personal liability on 
directors and officers for discrimination. 
Coverage under Stand-Alone Policies 
A minority of directors and officers liability pol icies exclude coverage for employment-related 
claims. However, most contain no such exclusions. Nevertheless, most large corporations purchase 
separate employment practices liability insurance (EPL I) on a stand-alone basis, which is intended to 
function as primary insurance when employment-related claims are made against directors and 
officers. Accordingly, this course will not examine employment-related director/officer claim 
exposures in detail, since these types of claims are more often covered by EPLI rather than D&O 
liability policy forms. For more information on empl oyment-related claims, refer to Course 6 in this 
series: “Employment Practices Liability Exposures and Insurance Coverage,” which treats this subject 
in depth.

Primary Defenses to Corporate Liability 
Chapter 6 sets forth the most common defenses when claims are made against directors and officers. 
These defenses can often reduce the extent of thei r liability and, depending upon the circumstances, 
completely absolve them of liability for damag es sought by a plaintiff. These defenses include 
detailed, accurate minutes of board meetings; the Business Judgment Rule; dissent; reliance; and 
ratification.  
The Importance of Minutes at Board Meetings 
The best defense to any claim of wrongdoing is that the director or officer did nothing wrong. Performance of a director's three basic duties of d iligence, loyalty, and obedience will generally avoid 
claims of wrongdoing. To establish such perfo rmance, the directors will frequently need 
documentation or other proof of what was done, consid ered, reviewed, or rejected at board meetings. 
Accordingly, properly kept cor porate minutes—documents that record the events taking place at 
board meetings—have high value. The careful, accu rate, and complete preparation of such minutes 
can provide effective defenses against allegations of  liability. On the other hand, board minutes that 
do not disclose what the directors knew or actually did, are of little defensive value.  
The Business Judgment Rule 
The business judgment rule is a rule of evidence th at is used as a defense when claims are made 
against corporate directors and officers. It creates a presumption that when the directors and officers made a business decision, they acted on an informed basis, in good fa ith, within their authority, and 
with the honest belief that the action taken w as in the best interest of the company.  
The Essence of the Business Judgment Rule: The Decision-Making Process  
 In a recent claim against the directors and offi cers of the Walt Disney Company, the Delaware 
Chancery Court reaffirmed the Court’s reluctance to  question corporate decisions, in the absence of 
obvious malfeasance, when it stated:  
… Should the Court apportion liability based on the ultimate outcome (emphasis added) 
of decisions taken in good faith by faithful directors or officers, those decision-makers 
would necessarily take decisions that minimized risk, not maximized value. The entire 
advantage of the risk-taking, innovative, w ealth-creating engine that is the Delaware 
corporation would cease to exist, with disastr ous results for shareholders and society 
alike.…  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
26 As evidenced by the court’s statement, the essence  of the business judgment rule is its attempt to 
encourage informed risk-taking by persons in charge of a corporation. Thus, unless it can be shown 
that the directors and officers clearly failed to exercise reasonable due diligence, they will generally 
not be held liable for the outcomes—ev en if unfavorable—of their decisions. 
Preconditions for the Business Judgment Rule To Apply 
There are five preconditions that must be present fo r the business judgment rule to be applicable, and 
thus absolve directors and officers, in the event it is  alleged that a decision they made caused a loss to 
the corporation or to one or more shar eholders. These preconditions are as follows. 
• The directors made a business decision (the rule does not apply where directors either 
abdicate their functions or simply fail to act);  
• The directors were disinterested  (i.e., that they had no personal stake) in the transaction or 
subject matter being decided;  
• The directors were informed  in making their decision;  
• The directors acted in good faith; and  
• The directors' conduct was not an abuse of discretion.  
The Business Judgment Rule: A Case Study 
The following scenario provides an example of how  the business judgment rule might be raised as a 
defense to a claim of liability against a corporation’s directors and officers.  
The Scenario 
In 2010, a multinational pharmaceutical company (“MN PC”) is considering the acquisition of a small 
drug manufacturer (“SDM”). For the past 10 years, SDM has been developing a formula that 
completely relieves the symptoms of arthritis. Initial clinical trials have been highly successful. In addition, there have been no side effects associated  with the drug during any of the trials. Although 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved the drug for distribution, approval 
appears likely within the next year, pending continued success during a second round of trials. 
MNPC’s own scientists have tested the formula, as  have independent scientific consultants hired by 
MNPC, and both are convinced of the drug’s e ffectiveness. Given these positive results, the MNPC’s 
board deliberates the acquisition during parts of six board meetings, over a 9-month time span. 
During these deliberations, MNPC considers waiti ng for final FDA approval, following the second 
round of trials, prior to making an offer to buy SD M. However, after many hours of analysis, the 
board reaches the conclusion that if MNPC do es wait until FDA approval, SDM’s acquisition price 
would increase substantially.  
In 2011, MNPC offers to pay the founder of SD M $50 million to acquire her company, which she 
accepts. In developing its offering price, MNPC hi red investment bankers to determine a basis for 
valuing the company, given the potential sales and pr ofits of SDM’s arthritis formula. The investment 
bankers estimated that if MNPC waited until the dr ug received final FDA approval, the founder of 
SDM would have been able to command a much higher price, probably around $250 million. The 
directors and officers presented the potential acquisition, and all of the facts surrounding it to 
shareholders, who approved the acquisition overwhelmingly.  Chapter 6—Primary Defenses  to Corporate Liability 
27 In 2012, a year after the acquisition, the FDA refu ses to release the drug for distribution to the public. 
In explaining its refusal, the FDA cites safety con cerns; during a second round of clinical trials, there 
were two deaths among volunteers who took the dr ug. The drug could potentially be modified to 
eliminate the risk of such complications. But to do so, MNPC’s scientists believe it would require 
removing a key ingredient that would all-but-elimin ate the drug’s effectiveness. Given the prospect 
that the new drug will never be allowed on the mark et, the $50 million acquisition price for SDM is 
now far in excess of the firm’s actual value. Wh en the FDA’s ruling is released to the public, 
MNPC’s share price drops from $40 to $20, resulting in a flood of lawsuits by MNPC’s shareholders 
against its directors and officers.  
The Business Judgment Rule as a Defense 
This scenario offers an example of how the busin ess judgment rule would likely provide an effective 
defense to a claim of liability against MNPC’s dir ectors and officers. Here was a case in which the 
directors and officers took a calculated risk in deciding to acquire SDM. Although the outcome of the decision was disastrous, the process by which the deci sion was made appears to have fallen within the 
boundaries of the rule, because: 
• The directors made a business decision  (the loss resulted from an active decision, rather than 
from a failure to act); 
• The directors were disinterested  in the transaction (none had any individual, personal 
financial stake in the acquisition);  
• The directors were informed  in making their decision (independent scientific and investment 
banking advice was sought prior to the acquisiti on; the decision to acquire SDM sooner rather 
than later was based upon the fact that the acquisition price would be substantially higher if 
MNPC waited until FDA approval); 
• The directors acted in good faith (there were no ulterior motives associated with the 
decision); and  
• The directors' conduct was not an abuse of discretion (the directors and officers were within the bounds of their authority under the corporation’s charter, to make the acquisition).  
Since the scenario fulfilled all five of the prec onditions for raising the business judgment rule as a 
defense, it is likely that in a real-world situation,  the directors and officers would have been absolved 
of liability for the financial conseque nces of the decision to acquire SDM. 
Dissent 
A director present at a board meeting usually will be  presumed to have voted in favor of the board's 
action unless his or her dissent from the action is record ed in the minutes or is filed with the corporate 
secretary either during the meeting or within a reasonable time after its adjournment. On the other 
hand, absence from a meeting or abstaining from voti ng is generally not recognized as a defense.  
If a director is uncomfortable with a board decision,  the director should affirmatively dissent (if at the 
meeting) or express a dissent at the next meeting (i f absent from the first meeting) and should be sure 
the dissent is recorded in the board minutes, by name.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
28 For dissent to qualify as a defense, a director must have voted against the action, as opposed to 
merely abstaining from the vote. When directors disagree with improper action taken by a board, the minutes should reflect such dissent, and it is a director's responsibility to make sure they do so. 
Reliance 
Reliance upon qualified persons, such as officers, expe rts, consultants, board committees, and legal 
counsel, may be a defense if the reliance is in good faith and with the proper degree of care. In 
performing their duties, directors may rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other fi nancial data prepared or presented by officers or employees of the 
corporation, legal counsel, public accountants, or other professionals, or a committee of the board. In 
relying on such sources, directors must act in good faith. However, they will not be considered to be 
acting in good faith if they have knowledge that  would cause their reliance to be unwarranted. (In 
other words, if, for example, they have knowledge th at the conclusions of an expert, in his report, are 
erroneous, the directors and officers cannot rely on that report.) Moreover, directors may not abdicate 
their responsibilities and seek exoneration from liability merely by delegating authority to board committees or subordinates. 
Ratification 
Ratification by shareholders of board decisions, if made with full disclosure, may constitute a defense 
to an action against the directors. (Ratification, as referred to here, could, for example involve a vote 
by shareholders to accept a buy-out offer from anot her corporation, at a specific price per share.) 
Such ratification must be the free, voluntary, and informed act of the shareholders. For a complete 
defense, ratification by 100 percent of the sharehol ders following full disclosure of all material facts 
may be necessary.

Securities Class Action Claims 
Securities class actions are, by far, the type of  claim in which the largest amount of damages are 
asserted against and paid by corporate directors and officers. This chapter will describe the nature of 
these claims.  
What are Securities Class Action Claims? 
Securities class action claims are brought by a publicly-held corporation's shareholders. They are 
claims in which a large group of people collectively br ing a claim to court. Such claims allege that 
specific actions (stated in lawsuit papers as “allega tions”) by a firm's directors and officers caused a 
loss in market value of the firm's securities.  
Advantages of Class Action for Plaintiffs  
Whenever more than a single person or organiza tion suffers a loss associated with the acts of a 
corporation’s directors and officers, there is a str ong likelihood that they will file their claim in the 
form of a class action. The advantages of a class action claim, from the standpoint of a plaintiff, include the fact that they (1) increase the efficiency  of the legal process because they bring together 
many plaintiffs, all of whom have alleged the same wrongdoings, against the same 
persons/organizations; (2) lower the cost of litiga tion (on a per-defendant basis); and (3) provide 
incentive for people to seek legal redress in situa tions where their damages would otherwise have 
been too small to have brought a lawsuit. For exam ple, an investor whose shares lost $5,000 in value 
probably could not find a lawyer to represent him/he r. However, if 1,000 investors with similar losses 
banded together to file a class action, it would be easier to secure legal representation as a “class.”  
What Triggers a Securities Class Action Claim?  
The immediate cause of most class action claims is th e release to the public of negative financial data 
pertaining to a corporation’s operations. These rele ases then produce heavy selling of the company’s 
stock, which, in turn, causes a precipitous drop in th e share price, ultimately resulting in a loss that is 
sustained by the organization's stockholders.  
Securities Class Action Clai ms: A Typical Scenario 
The following scenario depicts a typical sequence of events leading up to a securities class action 
claim. Assume that securities analysts have est imated that the XYZ Corporation will earn $2 per 
share during the quarter ending on March 31, 2010. When XYZ reports its actual earnings to the SEC 
on April 21, instead of a $2 per share profit, it rev eals a loss of $1 per share. This announcement of an 
“earnings miss” causes the company’s share price to  drop from $42 to $28. As a result, a group of Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
32 XYZ’s shareholders file a class action lawsuit. The shareholders allege that the company’s directors 
and officers have mismanaged the firm, a fact that is responsible for the $1 per share earnings loss. Based on the fact that 50 million shares of stock ar e outstanding, the lawsuit alleges a loss of $700 
million, which represents the diminution in market  value of all outstandi ng shares (50 million x $14 
($42 – $28)). Given this calculation, the magnit ude of damages claimed in securities litigation 
becomes apparent. The damages computed here are quite typical of those claimed in class action claims involving the shares of large publicly-traded companies. 
What Specific Actions Give Rise to Securities Class Action Claims? 
The immediate trigger  to most securities class action claims is a precipitous drop in a firm’s stock 
price, as illustrated above. However, it is important  to understand that securities class actions are the 
legal  form in which many claims, and by far the largest  ones, are made against corporate directors 
and officers, rather than the cause of action (i.e., the specific action or circumstance that gives rise to 
the claim). Chapters 8 and 9 of this course list a nd describe seven specific circumstances that most 
commonly give rise to securities class action claims.  
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act: Reducing Class 
Action Abuses 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA)  of 1995 was intended to eliminate many of the 
abusive practices associated with securities class action lawsuits. As will be explained below, starting 
around 1990, a number of plaintiffs’ lawyers (i.e ., lawyers who bring lawsuits on behalf of 
shareholders who allege losses), began devising and using highly questionable methods of bringing 
securities class action claims against major corporations.  
Anatomy of a “Shake-Down”: How Many  Class Action Lawsuits Originated 
Among the most prominent of such abuses involved s ecurities class action lawsuits instigated by a 
handful of law firms, most notably, the law firm of Milberg Weiss. Such firms arranged for various 
individuals (often referred to as “professional plai ntiffs”) to purchase small amounts of shares in a 
number of large, publicly-traded corporations. The fi rms then set up special departments that closely 
tracked the hour-by-hour fluctuations in the shar e prices of these companies’ stocks. Whenever a 
share price dropped significantly (e.g. more than 10 percent), during a short period of time (e.g., less 
than a week), the professional plaintiffs  brought securities class action lawsuits  against the directors 
and officers of the affected corporations. The plain tiffs asserted that specific acts of the directors and 
officers caused the stocks of these companies to lose va lue, a loss that was ulti mately sustained by the 
company’s shareholders.  
The essence of the scheme was to quickly bring suit, immediately after a drop in a company’s stock. 
This is because the individual who was first to file such a securities class action lawsuit, was designated as the “lead plaintiff,” and the law firm representing the lead plaintiff was legally entitled to represent the entire “class” of shareholders in the claim. This ruse allowed Milberg Weiss to collect 
huge fees when claims were settled against major corporations, despite the fact that its group of 
professional plaintiffs represented a tiny fraction of the corporations’ actual shareholders. 
Eventually, it was revealed that Milberg Weiss illegall y paid significant sums to certain individuals to 
serve as “professional plaintiffs,” so that Milberg Weiss would have the “inside track” in being able 
to serve as lead counsel when a class action claim wa s brought. (Several former partners in the firm 
are now serving time in jaim for their offenses.) Chapter 7—Securities Class Action Claims 
33 Specific PSLRA Reforms 
The most important changes implemented by the PSL RA was that it limited the frequency with which 
“professional plaintiffs” could serve as “lead plaintiff,” by limiting such persons from serving in that 
capacity more than 5 times in 3 years. The law also placed restrictions on the extent to which law 
firms who were the first to file claims, received the right to represent the entire class of shareholders, 
merely because they won the so-called “race to the courthouse,” as the Milberg Weiss law firm so often did.  
Results of PSLRA 
Unfortunately, the statute has not  been successful in curbing th e abuses associated with securities 
class action lawsuits. Nor did it reduce either the long-term frequency or severity of such claims. 
Rather, it has unexpectedly produced even higher  settlement amounts  in securities class action claims. 
The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005: Another Attempt To Control 
Class Actions  
The Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) of 2005, whic h expanded federal jurisdiction over many large 
class action lawsuits—including securities class action lawsuits—represented a second attempt to 
control the abuses associated with  these types of claims. Business groups and tort reform advocates 
lobbied for the legislation, asserting that it was essential to prevent class-action lawsuit abuse. 
Goals of the Act 
The Act attempted to achieve three key goals as discussed below.  
Reduction in the Number of Claims 
By requiring most class actions to be heard in federal rather than state courts, CAFA advocates 
foresaw a reduction in the number of securities clas s actions. This is because federal courts have 
historically been much more stringent than stat e courts in granting plaintiffs' class certification 
motions.  
Reduction of Forum Shopping  
Proponents of CAFA argue that in certain problema tic jurisdictions (e.g., Madison County, Illinois), 
juries were accustomed to awarding astronomical  sums that far exceeded actual damages.  
Greater Federal Scrutiny over Settlements 
CAFA advocates sought to reign in what they c onsidered the excessive fees often garnered by 
plaintiff’s attorneys. In some cases, these fees exceeded the amount of the actual monetary relief 
received by the class action plaintiffs themselves.  
 
     Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
34 Basic Provisions 
The Act gives federal courts—rather than state c ourts—jurisdiction over certain class actions: (1) in 
which the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, and (2) where any of the members of a class of 
plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from an y defendant. The practical effect of these provisions 
was that as a result of CAFA’s enactment, the vast majority of securities class action claims are now tried in federal, rather than state courts. This is  because virtually all such claims involve damages far 
exceeding $5 million, and because it is rare for such claims not to involve at least one plaintiff whose state of residence differs from the state of incorporation of the corporation being sued.  
The Act also contains a provision giving courts  greater scrutiny over class action settlements, 
especially those involving coupons. This provision was important because prior to CAFA, many 
settlements resulted in the distribution of produc t “coupons,” entitling plaintiffs to receive free 
merchandise produced by the corporation being sued—r ather than cash. In contrast, the attorneys who 
brought such claims received substantial cash fees. For example, in an infamous Alabama class action 
involving Bank of Boston, the attorneys' fees exceeded  the monetary award to the class members. The 
class members actually lost money because their a ttorney’s fees were paid from the monies the 
plaintiffs received from the settlement! (Coupons ar e not prohibited as a result of CAFA, although the 
Act does indicate that the value of such coupons mu st be reasonable, given the facts of the case and 
the losses sustained by the investors.) 
Impact 
Since CAFA was enacted in 2005, its impact on the number and outcome of securities class action 
claims remains uncertain. Additional years must pass before an accurate assessment of the law’s 
actual effect can be made.  
Securities Class Action Claim Data 
This section provides a brief recap of securities class action claim and settlement data since 1996. 
The Correlation between Claim Filings and Industry Sector  
Exhibit 7.1, below, indicates the extent to whic h securities class action claims are correlated with 
specific industries. For example, in 2008, nearly one-third of all new claim filings were made against 
firms in the financial sector. In addition, during th e 2000–02 period, a high perc entage of claims were 
filed against technology and communications compan ies. Lastly, in 2002, utilities firms were the 
most prominent securities class action target, a fact indicating that not only Enron, but more than one-
third of the companies operating with in this sector were also sued.

Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: Part 1 
Chapter 8 will discuss four specific situations that can  give rise to claims against corporate directors 
and officers. These include claims from: (1) financia l restatements, (2) initial public offerings (IPOs), 
(3) change-of-control situations, and (4) stock option backdating. 
Financial Restatement Claims 
Claims associated with financial restatements are a substantial exposure faced by corporate directors 
and officers. Such claims typically result when ther e is material adjustment to a corporate financial 
statement that affects the cumulative results of ope rations during past years. Usually, a financial 
restatement takes the form of a revision to a corpor ation's past operating results that are significantly 
less favorable than those originally reported (e.g., a company might reveal that instead of making $22 
million in the just-ended fiscal year, as originally re ported, it actually lost $12 million). Most often, 
the announcement of a restatement triggers a massive  sell-off of the company’s stock, thereby causing 
investors to suffer a severe loss. Th e investors then bring a claim against the company’s directors and 
officers.  
Notable Financial Restatement Claims  
In recent years, a number of major public corporations have issued restatements, which have, in turn, 
prompted dramatic sell-offs of th e organizations' shares of stock, ultimately triggering claims against 
the firms' directors and officers.  
• In the case of WorldCom, routine business expenses were hidden by improperly claiming them as long-term investments. According to  experts who later examined WorldCom’s 
books, even a routine audit would have uncovere d such practices, which inflated the firm's 
profits by $4 billion in 2001 and part of 2002.  
• Appliance maker Sunbeam inflated its 1997 earnings by $71 million to make it appear that 
the company's operating results were improving. This ruse was blessed by the firm's regular 
auditor but was uncovered when the board of directors brought in outside auditors.  
• In the case of Enron, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2001, its regular 
auditors at Arthur Andersen were aware of  possible fraudulent practices but failed to act 
aggressively on such information. Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
40 There are two key questions that should be asked in  conjunction with any financial restatement: (1) 
What events caused the n eed for a restatement? (2) What kinds of accounting errors and irregularities 
caused the restatement?  
What Events Cause the Need for Restatements? 
A number of specific events have most often given ri se to corporate financial restatements, including 
the following. 
• Audit exceptions revealed by independent audito rs. (An “exception” in an audit occurs when 
an auditor disagrees with the accounting treatment  of a certain item, such as when a company 
has booked merchandise shipped to dealers as “final sales,” even though unsold merchandise 
can be returned for full credit.)  
• Incumbent or, in some instances, new management's discovery of financial improprieties.  
• Whistle-blower's reporting (internal or exte rnal) of major financial irregularities. 
• SEC inquiry, either by the Division of Corporation Finance or the Division of Enforcement.  
• Due diligence review, usually conducted in c onjunction with mergers or acquisitions.  
• Internal corporate investigations (often asso ciated with one or more of the foregoing 
situations).  
What Kinds of Accounting Errors and Irregularities Cause Restatements?  
The following categories of accounting errors and irregularities cause restatements.  
Revenue Recognition 
The majority of restatement claims involve matte rs of revenue recognition. Such issues can range 
from the intentional, fraudulent recording of fictitio us sales to more subtle situations involving the 
booking of sales to customers as “final,” despite the fact  that the customer had the right to return the 
goods within 60 days. 
Asset Overstatement 
Such situations involve the overv aluing of inventory, fixed assets, and often intangibles, which are 
inherently difficult to value, such as goodwill, trademarks, and patents.  
Restructuring Charges 
When a company closes a division of its business, such as a large manufacturing plant, there will 
ordinarily be significant costs associated with su ch actions, including (but not limited to) severance 
payments to workers. However, the extent of su ch charges is sometimes either deliberately or 
negligently understated, thus increasing a corporation's earnings (or reducing its losses). 
Accounting for Business Combinations 
This often occurs when a company purchases anothe r company and the buyer either overvalues the 
assets of the entity it has purchased, or the buyer unde rstates the extent of the new entity's liabilities, 
such as potential payments that the new company may be obligated to make in conjunction with lawsuits that have been filed against the newly acquired entity.  Chapter 8—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 1 
41 Understatement of Liabilities or Asset Impairments 
Most often, this takes the form of failure to r ecord contingencies that are both likely to occur and 
readily estimable, such as uninsured litigation, in which a settlement date is near. Understatement of 
liabilities can also take the form of failure to reflect the impairment of assets such as overvaluing 
uncollectible receivables or failing to write off obsolete inventory. 
Creation and Misuse of Impermissible Reserves 
These are also known as “cookie jar reserves,” the sole  purpose of which is to “manage” or “smooth” 
earnings, so that a corporation will be able to repor t steady quarter-to-quarter growth, despite the lack 
of profit from genuine business operations. 
IPO-Related Claims  
Initial public offerings (IPO)-relate d claims allege various types of wrongdoing in conjunction with 
the way in which investment bankers (also known as securities underwriters), sold shares of stock in 
the IPO to investors. Such claims were preval ent during the late 1990s and early 2000s when the 
demand for shares in companies making IPOs was especially strong, mainly because the U.S. economy was growing rapidly. This environment, co mbined with a rising stock market, made IPOs a 
ready source of profit for investors. While IPO-relate d claims have been infrequent since that period, 
if these economic conditions return, similar volumes of IPO-related litigation could again emerge.  
How Does an IPO Work?  
Assume that Company X seeks to raise $100 milli on to expand its operations. One means of doing so 
is to sell shares of Company X to the public. To accomplish this, Company X could retain the 
services of an investment banker. The banker would ma ke the arrangements required to sell the firm’s 
shares to the public, in return for which, the inv estment banker receives a commission of 10 percent 
to 20 percent of the proceeds that were raised in the process.  
In this situation, the investment banker might , for example, issue and sell 60 million shares of 
Company X’s stock in the open market at a price of $20 per share. Customers typically include a 
variety of mutual funds, banks, pension funds, insu rance companies, brokerages houses, corporations, 
and individual investors. Assuming the investment banker was able to sell all of Company X’s shares, 
the IPO would have raised a total of $120 million ($60 million shares x $20 per share = $120 million), $100 million of which would go to Co mpany X to fund its expansion program. The 
remaining $20 million would go to the investme nt banker as a fee for their services. This is 
essentially how an IPO works. 
Types of IPO Claims 
There are three distinct IPO claim types. 
    
 
 Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
42 Laddering or Tie-In Agreements 
Laddering claims allege that invest ment bankers forced buyers of shares in IPOs to agree that, as a 
condition of receiving a significant number of shares,  the buyers would purchase additional shares in 
the “after-market,” immediately following the issuance of shares in th e IPO. These purchases are 
intended to markedly increase demand for the stock, ultimately resulting in a substantial rise in the 
market price of the stock immediately after it is so ld to the public and begins trading on one of the 
major stock exchanges. (It is in the investment banke rs’ best interest if such shares rise in price after 
they are issued, for two reasons. First, a price increase indicates that the IP O was a “success.” Second, 
investment bankers sometimes buy IPO shares for their own accounts, which will benefit them when 
the share price rises.) This approach is consistent with data provided by Dan A. Bailey, a prominent 
D&O attorney, who found that in 1999, the average first-day price gain of IPOs was 60 percent and in 
2000, the average gain was approximately 55 percent.  In effect, so-called IPO laddering claims assert 
that the investment bankers coerced buyers of the IP Os into buying additional shares, so as to increase 
the market price of the shares, imme diately after the shares went public. 
Failure To Disclose Commissions 
The second type of IPO-related claims allege that IPO investment bankers received larger 
compensation from investors than was revealed in the IPO prospectus, a fact that rendered the prospectus false and misleading. (The prospectus is th e document that describes the nature of the 
company in which buyers are investing. A prospectus also discusses the details surrounding the arrangements that the company has made with inv estment bankers, pertaining to sales of its stock.) 
These undisclosed, additional commissions in effect  served as “kickbacks” from certain investors in 
exchange for being allowed to buy a larger-than- usual number of shares in the IPO. Claims were 
made against the investment bankers by parties who received fewer IPO shares than others, because they were unaware of and therefore did not make “kick back” payments, in return for additional 
shares. 
Conflicts of Interest  
The third type of claim associated with IPOs invol ves conflict of interest allegations. Such claims 
assert that there were conflicts between the resear ch analysts (a group of supposedly objective 
securities analysts who recommended to the public that they buy shares in the IPOs) and the 
investment bankers who actually sold shares in an IP O to the public. The conflicts of interest resulted 
from the fact that the research analysts and the inv estment bankers worked for the same company! To 
increase the market price for a ne w issue, investment bankers promoted the stock through their 
research analysts by citing the analysts’ see mingly independent, objective evaluations and 
recommendations. Ultimately, this had the effect of  increasing the market price for the new securities 
to the detriment of the buyers of these securities. 
Claims from “Change-of-Control” Situations 
Directors and officers are exposed to claims in ch ange-of-control situations (e.g., when one company 
is purchased by another company) because there is ge nerally an inherent conflict of interest between 
and among: their duty to shareholders to ensure that they receive a fair and maximum price for their shares, their duty to the corporation to protect its best interests as a corporate entity, and their self-serving interest of preserving their own personal jobs and security. Chapter 8—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 1 
43 The Typical Change-of-Control Claim Scenario 
When one or more offers are made to acquire a co rporation, directors have the obligation of seeking 
the transaction offering the highest available price to the shareholders. But, given these inherent 
conflicts, virtually any decision reached by corporate managers involving a change-of-control 
situation may be subject to attack as an alleged viol ation of the fiduciary duties of the directors. This 
is because the corporate directors and officers will be inclined to reject all offers, no matter how 
favorable for stockholders, because they are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the buy-out.  
Frequent Claimants  
Accordingly, directors/officers frequently become  targets of litigation, when someone becomes 
dissatisfied with their response to a bid. Depending on  the nature of the bid and the board's reaction to 
it, potential plaintiffs may include: shareholders of  the corporation, the persons or entity making the 
bid, creditors, and regulatory agencies.  
Types of Claims Made against Direct ors and Officers in Change-of-Control 
Situations 
The primary allegations against directors of the target company (i.e., the company being acquired) 
and, to a lesser extent, directors of th e acquiring company, include the following. 
Resistance to Hostile Takeovers  
Directors of a target company who resist a hostile  takeover attempt can still be quite vulnerable to 
legal attack. Disgruntled shareholde rs often allege that the directors breached their fiduciary duty by 
resisting the takeover proposal, thereby denying the shareholders the opportunity to sell their shares at 
the offer price, which is almost always significantly higher than the price at which the stock is trading 
on the various exchanges. The amount of recoverabl e damages in such a claim can be enormous, and 
therefore the settlement value may be large.  
Approval of Friendly Takeovers  
The directors of the company being acquired, who ap prove an acquisition of their company, also are 
frequently sued by shareholders who allege that the directors failed to make an informed decision 
regarding the adequacy of the purchase price. Or, it can be alleged that the directors failed to “shop” 
the company to other potential buyers who would have offered an even higher per share price. These cases are typically less severe than the hostile takeover case (above) since the potential recoverable damages are usually much less. Shareholders in th is type of litigation freque ntly seek a “bump-up” in 
the purchase price.  
For example, Company A was sold to Company B for $80 per share. However, A’s shareholders 
allege that A is really worth $100 per share. T hus, A’s shareholders would seek damages of $20 per 
share in this case: the difference between their own $100 per share opinion as to the share’s value and 
the actual $80 sale price.  
 
 
  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
44 Preacquisition Mismanagement  
After a company is acquired, the new owners and their appointed managers may determine that the 
directors and officers of the acquired company mism anaged the company prior to the acquisition and 
as a result, sue the prior directors and officers for the injury caused to the company. For example, 
after acquiring Company A, Company B may discover that the Company A’s customer base is highly 
dissatisfied with A’s product or service, a fact  that Company A deliberately concealed during 
acquisition negotiations. As a result, four major ac counts, comprising 25 percent of A’s sales, cease to 
do business with A, within 6 months after the acquisition.  
These claims are not common, because the acquiri ng company typically co nducts a thorough due 
diligence investigation before agreeing to purchase th e company. However, this type of claim is 
brought occasionally and is particularly problematic  for the defendant directors and officers since 
they no longer control the company, its indemnification policies, or its insurance programs.  
Failure To Disclose  
Change-of-control activity frequently results in class action securities lawsuits against the directors 
and officers of the acquired company, alleging that they did not accurately, completely, or timely disclose the existence of their negotiations or other related material information about the transaction. 
Courts have refused to articulate a bright-line rule  for determining when such negotiations must be 
publicly disclosed. Directors and officers are thus pl aced in a dilemma of not wanting to disclose the 
existence and terms of the negotiations either prematurely or delinquently.  
Early Disclosure 
If disclosure is too early and the transaction does not occur as disclosed, shareholders who purchased 
stock after the disclosure will allege they were injured because the defendants artificially inflated the stock price by the premature disclosure.  
Late Disclosure 
If disclosure is too late, shareholders who sold their stock prior to the disclosure will allege that they 
were injured because they sold th eir stock prior to the large price increase following the merger 
announcement. 
The disclosure exposure exists with respect to dir ectors and officers of both the target company and 
the acquiring company.  
Mismanagement (Following the Acquisition) 
Directors and officers of the acquiring company can also incur liability in connection with 
management of the acquired company. This exposur e has proven particularly problematic when the 
acquisition is part of a diversification program of the acquiring company, since directors and officers 
of the acquiring company frequently have little experience in managing a company in a completely new industry or market.  
Claims from “Option Backdating” 
During the spring of 2006 and continuing through the remainder of the year, a number of claims 
alleging illegal backdating of stock options were made against the directors and officers of numerous 
corporations. Like IPO-related claims discussed earlier in this chapter, a large number of claims 
produced by illegal stock option backdating practices were made in a relatively brief period of time Chapter 8—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 1 
45 (i.e., the second half of 2006 and early 2007), a phenomenon that has not been repeated since. As of 
February 1, 2009, approximately 33 option-backdatin g related claims have been made. However, an 
abundance of such claims, given the prevalence of option-related compensation of directors and 
officers, might reemerge at some point, and for that reason, merit discussion. 
What are “Stock Options”? 
Stock options give an individual the right to purchase shares of stock in a corporation at a specified 
price, usually, but not always, on or before a speci fied date. Stock options are routinely offered to 
corporate officers and directors (and sometimes to employees), as a means of providing them with added incentive to improve the firm's profitability, which, in theory at least, will boost the market 
price of the corporation's stock. 
An Example 
Typically, a board of directors will “price” an option at the market price of the stock, on the day the option is granted. For example, a CEO receives a 2-year grant of 100,000 options on January 1, 2008, a date on which the company's shares are selling for $25 per share. This gives the CEO the right to purchase 100,000 shares of the company's stock, on or before January 1, 2010, for $25 per share. If 
the CEO exercises the option when the shares are selling for $35 per share, he or she will realize a 
per-share profit of $10 ($35 market price minus $25 option price) and a total profit of $1 million 
(100,000 shares multiplied by $10).  
The purpose of such arrangements is to incentivi ze the CEO to increase the company’s share price. 
This, in turn, would allow him/her to exercise the op tion at a price far higher than the price at which it 
was granted (in this case $25 per share). Conversely, it also lays the foundation for earnings 
manipulation, in an attempt to in flate the company’s stock price.  
What is “Backdating”? 
Backdating occurs when the grant date for an award is set at an earlier date and at a lower exercise 
price than the one on which the option is actually gr anted. So in the above example, backdating would 
occur if, on January 1, 2008, the CEO were given a 4-year option grant that covered the period from 
January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2010. But in this situation, the market price of the stock was $15 on 
January 1, 2006, a fact that would allow the CEO to  purchase the stock at $15, rather than the current 
$25 share price. As a result, the CEO's profit, assuming he or she exercised the option on January 1, 2010, when the stock was selling for $35, would be  $2 million ($35 share price minus $15 exercise 
price multiplied by 100,000 shares), as opposed to $1 million as in the above example. 
Backdating “Per Se ” Is Not Illegal 
One key point regarding backdating is that, by itself,  the type of option backdating noted in the above 
example is not against the law. Rather, what is illegal and what did trigger investigations and lawsuits 
were the fact that a number of companies: (1) did not disclose such practices to shareholders and the 
general public, and that in some instances (2) director/officer recipients of options did not pay the requisite taxes on them.  
In contrast, the kinds of option practices noted below are clearly illegal. 
“Spring-loading”: a Controversial and Illegal Form of Option Backdating  
An even more controversial, a nd usually illegal form of backdatin g, is known as “spring-loading.” 
There are two types of spring-loading. Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
46 Granting an Option Just Prior to Favorable News 
One type of spring-loading occurs  when an option is granted just prior to the announcement of 
positive corporate news. The expectation under such  circumstances is that the news will boost the 
company's share price and therefore the value of th e option grant. For example, assume that Company 
X is expected to announce its first quarter earni ngs on April 20. Although securities analysts expect 
Company X to earn $1 per share, on April 18, Co mpany X’s comptroller tells Company X’s CEO: 
“This was a blow-out quarter. We’re looking at earnings of $2.50 per share.” With this knowledge, 
Company X’s CEO calls an emergency meeting of the firm’s board of directors, at which he requests 
the company’s directors to grant him an option to sell 1 million shares of stock, exercisable any time 
within the next year. On April 20, immediately after the earnings announcement, Company X’s share 
price soars to from $25 to $45 and the next day, the CEO exercises his option, selling his shares at 
$45 each, and garnering a one-day profit of $20 million ($45 – $25= $20 share price rise x 1 million 
shares owned = $20 million). 
Granting an Option Just After Negative News 
Another type of spring-loading is to make an optio n grant immediately after the release of especially 
negative news that has adversely impacted a company's share price. This has the effect of issuing the 
grant at an artificially low price, from which the st ock is expected to bounce back relatively quickly, 
ultimately increasing the total profit that can be r ealized. For example, assume the reverse of the 
above situation, whereby quarterly earnings are expect ed to be $2.50, yet company insiders know that 
they will report earnings of just $1. In this inst ance, the expectation is that the earnings “miss” will 
cause the stock to drop, but since there are no other negative issues facing the company, the share price is expected to recover relatively quickly.  So in this case, assuming the negative announcement 
causes Company X’s stock to drop from $25 to $15,  after the announcement, CEO could seek an 
options grant of 1 million shares at a price of $15, knowing that the stock will rebound shortly, 
therefore increasing his chances of realizing a profit on the eventual sale.

costs of providing the severance pay to which Kr eisler’s laid-off workers were entitled. This 
understatement: 
a. Causes Kreisler to overstate its actual ea rnings (or understate its actual losses).

that the investment banker would permit. He la ter learned that other investors who paid the 
banker an additional “commission” under the tabl e had been permitted to purchase a larger 
stake in Ytech. Warrant’s suit against Ytech’s directors and officers will most likely allege that: 
a. A conflict of interest existed between corporate directors and officers and the investment 
banker. 
b. The board had engaged in an illegal laddering arrangement.  
c. The IPO involved an inappropriate tie-in agreement. 
d. The IPO prospectus was misleading becau se it failed to accurately disclose the

Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: Part 2 
Chapter 9 will discuss four additional situations that can give rise to claims against corporate directors 
and officers. These include claims from: (1) auction rate securities, (2) subprime lending, (3) private 
equity operations, and (4) the Bernard Madoff investment Ponzi scheme. 
Claims from Auction Rate Securities 
During 2008, a number of lawsuits were filed agains t the directors and officers of major investment 
banks and brokers, in conjunction with financial instruments know n as “auction rate securities” 
(ARSs). Banks and brokerages pitched ARSs to cor porations and to high net worth individuals as 
safe, but higher-yielding alternatives to cash—that were just as liquid as cash (or so investors were led to believe).  
What are Auction Rate Securities? 
An auction rate security (ARS) is essentially a long-term bond, issued by a corporation or a 
municipality. However, ARSs differ from bonds in one crucial respect. Rather than paying a fixed 
rate of interest for a long period of time (e.g., a minimum of 10 years and sometimes as long as 30 
years), the interest rate on an ARS “resets” frequently through a process known as a Dutch Auction, which takes place every 7, 28, or 35 days. Accordingly, at each Dutch Auction, holders of an ARS have the opportunity to sell the security.  
Issuers/borrowers benefit from this arrangement because ARSs can provide them with long-term 
financing, but at substantially lower rate s compared to traditional, long-term bonds. 
What Went Wrong?  
Beginning in February of 2008, auctions for these secu rities began to “fail” due to a lack of bids, 
something that investors were told was highly unlikely to happen. The probl em arose largely because 
the four largest investment banks that sold ARSs (Citigroup, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill 
Lynch) refused to act as bidders of last resort, as they had done previously. Until recently, these and 
other financial institutions had stepped in with their capital to prevent failures when bidding faltered. 
But these firms grew unwilling to commit their money to ARSs after suffering billions in credit losses 
and mortgage write-downs stemming from the subpr ime mortgage collapse (yet another source of 
D&O claims and a situation that will be discussed later in this course). Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
50 What Were the Consequences of Failed Auctions?  
The failure of the auctions did not mean that the AR Ss went into default. This is because the issuer 
continued to pay interest on them. However, the l ack of liquidity caused by the auction “failure” 
meant that investors' money was essentially frozen in their accounts, an event that few anticipated, 
because, as already noted, the extreme liquidity of these instruments was one of its major selling 
points. 
What Is the Basis of the Lawsuits?  
The basis of the class action lawsuits (against the investment banking firms that promoted ARSs to 
investors) was that the ARSs were sold as short-term  instruments, when, in reality, they turned into 
long-term ones. Since ARSs were marketed as highl y liquid, short-term investments, the lawsuits 
alleged losses based on investors' inability to cash  out on an as-needed basis, the essential selling 
point of ARSs.  
Claim Counts 
According to The D & O Diary  as of February 1, 2009, a total of 21 class action lawsuits involving 
ARSs had been filed against broker dealers, security issuers, and mutual funds, among others. (There were also a significant number of single plaintiff securities lawsuits filed on behalf of preferred shareholders and subordi nated debt holders.) 
Claims from the Subprime Mort gage Lending/Credit Crisis  
The litigation wave that was triggered by subprime lending and the accompanying credit crisis began 
with the filing of the first subprime mortgage-rela ted lawsuits in early Fe bruary 2007. Two years 
later, in February of 2009, claims  continue to be made and there are no signs that they are subsiding. 
The following discussion provides a brief description of how and why the credit crisis began and, 
most important, an overview of the nature and types of D&O liability exposures and claims that the 
crisis has produced.  
Step One: Subprime Loans  
The mortgage lending/credit crisis originated w ith subprime real estate loans. These loans carry 
interest rates that are substantially above the prime mortgage loan rate. The prime rate is the lowest 
rate available and is offered to bo rrowers with credit scores that are considerably higher than average. 
In contrast, subprime loans are made to borrowers  who pose a high credit risk, either because they 
have: (1) a low credit score or (2) a high debt-to-income ratio. Another important characteristic of subprime loans is the fact that the vast majority were made with low down payments (e.g., less than 5 
percent of the property’s value) a nd, in some cases, no down payments. 
Traditionally, subprime loans constituted only about 5 percent of the typical bank’s mortgage loan 
portfolio. However, beginning around in 2002, and continuing through 2005 (a year in which approximately 20 percent of all real estate loan s could be classified as subprime), banks began 
sharply increasing the proportion of subprime loans they made. In fact, during the 2003–05 period, 
total, outstanding subprime debt outstanding increase d nearly by a factor of three, from $332 billion 
to $1.3 trillion.  
What Fueled the Demand for Subprime Loans? 
Two factors were instrumental in driving the de mand for subprime loans: (1) initially low “teaser 
rates” and (2) rapidly rising real estate values. Chapter 9—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 2 
51 The Lure of “Teaser Rates” 
The first 2 to 3 years of the typical subprime loan amortized at relatively low interest rates and 
consequently required low monthly payments. Howeve r, after this period, the initially low “teaser 
rate” would reset to a much higher rate, which, of course, produced a significantly higher monthly 
payment. For example, initially, a subprime loan might have amortized at an interest rate of only 4 percent for the first 2 years. However, after this pe riod, it would reset to 12 percent. An interest rate 
shift of this magnitude might, for example, have taken an initially affordable monthly payment of 
$1,000 and increased it to an unaffordable $2,500 per month.  
Skyrocketing Values and the Real Estate “Gold Rush” 
The demand for subprime rate loans was also being driven by rapidly increasing real estate values. 
Beginning around 1996, the general level of home prices began to rise faster than the historical norm, 
which, for years had tended to approximate the general level of inflation. By 2000, this trend began accelerating to an even greater extent, so that by 2002, on a national basis, real estate was 
appreciating far faster than the inflation rate. Moreover, in certain areas of California, Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, home prices were rising by  as much as 35 percent per year. This trend 
produced a virtual “gold rush” mentality, whereby residential real estate became a “sure thing” 
investment. Even if the eventual rate on a subprim e loan became onerous, many borrowers were told 
and also gambled on the possibility that, given skyr ocketing home values, it would be a simple matter 
for them to refinance their loan on much more favorable terms—well before the regular, subprime rate actually kicked in.  
What Went Wrong? 
Beginning in mid-2006, subprime loan rates began to reset en masse. Accompanying the resets were 
sharply higher monthly payment amounts, which, in turn, touched off a wave of loan defaults by 
buyers who could now no longer a fford to make such payments.  
At virtually the same time, nationwide real estate prices first stopped increasing, then started to drop, 
and in many areas began to plummet by up to 25 percent on an annualized basis—especially in states 
and cities that, during the 2002–200 5 period, had witnessed similarly meteoric increases in value. 
Unfortunately, subprime borrowers were now unable to “escape” from their predicaments by either 
refinancing at a lower rate or by simply selling their property. This was because in virtually all 
instances, given falling real estate prices, their out standing loan balance now  far exceeded the value 
of their home (a fact that resulted not only from plummeting home values, but also because, as noted earlier, virtually all subprime loans were made w ith no, or very low down payments). Given such 
circumstances, even if a subprime borrower could find  a buyer for their property, the proceeds of such 
a sale would, in nearly all cases, be vastly insufficient to pay off their existing loan.  
Rate Resets and Plummeting Values Comb ine To Trigger a Foreclosure Wave 
The combination of rate resets and plummeting real estate values produced a surge of foreclosures. The end-result of the entire process was that ba nks began losing money because the expected cash 
flows from the subprime loans were not forthcoming. Even worse was the fact that given the elevated 
number—and geographical concentration of de faults—when banks began repossessing homes, these 
properties became extremely difficult to unload, even  at fire sale prices. In many instances, entire 
neighborhoods were dotted with foreclosed homes th at sat empty, making them not only challenging 
to resell, but also exposing the homes to systematic looting and vandalism, a fact that further reduced 
their value. The bottom line for banks with extensive subprime loan portfolios: the true market values Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
52 of such properties are, in virtually all cases, vas tly below their outstanding loan values, regardless of 
whether they had been foreclosed on or not. 
Cash-Out Refinancing: the Final Nail in the Coffin 
Exacerbating the-above described circumstances was the fact that during the late 1990s and early 
2000s, millions of people with existing home loans began borrowing heavily against the equity in 
their homes. When real estate values began to sink  by mid-decade, they too often found themselves 
with negative equity positions in their homes (as did subprime borrowers). These circumstances also contributed to additional defaults and consequent foreclosures, even  among mortgage loans that were 
not of the subprime variety. This was because any time the outstanding balance of a loan exceeds the value of the underlying property, there is a much greater probability of default.  
Step Two: Securitization  
The second factor underlying the subprime mortgage le nding/credit crisis was the fact that many of 
these risky loans were “securitized.”  
What is Securitization? 
Securitization is a process whereby periodic cash flows from a given source are pooled, packaged, 
and sold to investors, usually in the form of bo nds. Accordingly, groups of subprime mortgage loans 
were bundled together to create what are referred to  as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), more 
commonly known as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs).  
Under such arrangements, the subprime loans were pack aged and then sold to investors who, in return 
for paying an up-front principal amount, received periodic payments (usually quarterly) in the same 
manner as bondholders. Such loans were typically sold by the original lender (i.e., the banks), to a 
trust entity, which packaged them into bonds, then sold them to individual and institutional investors 
through an investment banking firm. 
By 2006, approximately 63 percent of all subprime loans were being sold and packaged in this 
fashion. When the defaults began, the value of the underlying bonds began to plummet because the 
collateral backing the bonds (i.e., the periodic cash flows in the form of monthly payments from the 
subprime loans), was substantially lower than anticip ated given the wave of loan defaults, and thus 
were insufficient to pay the interest mandated by the bonds. 
The Role of the Credit Rating Agencies 
A key “enabler” of the securitization process was the credit rating agencies responsible for rating 
these MBSs. Specifically, Standard & Poor’s, Moody ’s, and Fitch were the leading firms that 
routinely assigned investment grade ratings to mortga ge backed securities backed  by subprime loans. 
These and other rating agencies bear a significant part of the responsibility for the wave of eventual 
MBS defaults, because the agencies badly underestim ated the probability of default by subprime 
borrowers. By the end of 2007, it was estimated that investors around the world had lost in the neighborhood of $300 to $400 billion on MBS investments. 
Step Three: Credit Derivatives 
The third factor underlying the subprime mortgage lending/credit crisis was the fact that a vast 
mountain of credit derivatives, were written to  insure these collateralized debt obligations. 
Derivatives are financial contracts, whose values are a function of some other asset, known as the 
“underlying asset.” These underlying assets might include shares of stock in a specific company, a Chapter 9—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 2 
53 group of residential mortgages, bonds, or indexes (i.e., the Standard & Poor’s 500 index). The 
purpose of derivatives is to reduce the risk of economic loss for holders of the underlying asset on 
which the derivative is based, a process known as hedg ing. Conversely, derivatives can be used by 
investors to earn profit if the value of the underlyi ng asset moves in the direction they anticipate, a 
process known as speculating. 
How Do Derivatives Operate?  
An MBS holder, by means of a credit default swap , one common type of deri vative, could buy what 
is, in effect, an insurance policy that would pay off the investor if the MBS de faulted. In theory, such 
arrangements, make perfect sense because they fac ilitate the operation of the credit markets. By 
having such derivatives available, they encourage investors to buy MBSs, while allowing them to 
“hedge their bets,” protecting them in th e event the underlying bond defaults.  
Credit Derivatives: What Went Wrong 
Unfortunately, too many of the entities that “wrote” such derivative contracts, which, as noted above, 
really amounted to insurance policies, did not have sufficient capital to pay off these obligations once 
the MBSs began to default on a grand scale. 
Derivatives: AIG’s and Bear Stearns’ Undoing 
When the entity that provides such insurance protection—afte r it has collected its upfront 
premiums—doesn’t have the money to pay the insure d buyer in the case of a default, the insurance 
policy is essentially worthless. Because it wrote so many of these contracts, but didn’t have the 
capital to back them up, the investment banking fi rm Bear Stearns became insolvent. It “survived” 
only because what remained of the company was bought by JP Morgan. Bear Stearns literally could 
not go bankrupt because the trillions of dollars in credit default swaps on its books would have been 
wiped out had it been allowed to do so. If Bear were allowed to default on these obligations, all the banks and other financial institu tions that had purchased “swaps” (i.e., insurance on MBSs) from Bear 
would, in effect, be uninsured . This, in turn, would have re quired these banks and financial 
institutions to write-down billions of dollars in MBS assets that th ey had been carrying at much 
higher values, because they could claim to have b een insured against potential losses associated with 
these MBS assets. 
The same fate would have befa llen American International Group Inc. (AIG) had the United States 
government not stepped in and injected approximate ly $150 billion in capital into AIG; money that 
was required to, in effect, “cover” AIG’s losing bets  on mortgage-backed securities that were secured 
by subprime loans. The problem with AIG w as not its property, casualty, and life insurance 
operations. Rather, the problem was that, as of June 30, 2008, AIG had written swaps on other 
corporate bonds, and worse, mortgage-backed securities,  that carried with them the potential to pay as 
much as $441 billion if they all defaulted. As the value of these bonds conti nued to fall (and in many 
cases, default), AIG was forced to post additional capital to back these bad bets, collateral which it 
didn’t have.

54 Derivatives “on Steroids”:  Enter the Speculators 
What took the problems created by derivatives to an entirely new and wholly toxic level was the fact 
that in addition to those who sought them for protection (i.e., by hedging) because they owned the 
underlying MBSs or other bonds, speculators began buying derivatives simply because they believed, 
or at least thought, there was a reasonable probability, that many of the MBSs would default, a 
scenario that could produce substantial profits—desp ite the fact that these speculators held no 
ownership interest in the underlying bonds themselves.  
For example, assume that an individual or institutional investor thought that a particular bond was in 
jeopardy because the underlying collateral (i.e., the subprime mortgages backing it) were nearly worthless. This situation would present a high risk of default and the conse quent inability of the bond 
issuer to pay back its bondholders. Under such condi tions, the investor or institution could speculate 
by buying, and paying premiums for, credit defa ult swaps on this bond, which would pay the full face 
amount of the bonds if they did actually default. Conv ersely, if the investor or institution believed that 
the bond was solid as a rock, such investors/institutions could offer insurance to a speculator, who 
held the opposite opinion about the bond’s ability to pay its bondholders. 
The Bottom Line?  
On a worldwide basis, it has b een estimated that a total of $62 trillion in these derivative 
contracts/”swaps” remains active. And as long as subp rime mortgage defaults persist on an enormous 
scale (as they have continued to do, through Februa ry 2009), losses will continue to pile up for both 
“writers” of these swap contracts who don’t have the capital to pay off all of their bad bets, but also 
for “buyers” of these contracts who are losing money when the bonds do, in fact, default, yet were 
“insured” by firms that have insufficient capital to actually pay the losses as promised by the terms of 
the “swap.”  
Despite the estimated $62 trillion figure, no one rea lly knows the true extent of the exposure from 
“swaps” because the derivatives market is complete ly unregulated. Accordingly, every estimate of 
this exposure is just that—an estimate. No wonder super investor Warren Buffett has called 
derivatives “weapons of financial mass destruction.” 
What Are the Leading Claim Allegati ons against Corporate Directors and 
Officers? 
A wide variety of claim sources have arisen fro m the subprime mortgage lending/credit crisis. 
Borrowers Suing Lenders (and Related Parties) 
As of early 2009, a total of approximately 156 la wsuits have been filed against lenders and their 
directors and officers.  
Suits Based on Fraudulent  Lending Practices 
Suits have alleged that subprime borrowers were  victimized by various fraudulent lending practices 
and that the lenders, along with their director s and officers, had overseen and sanctioned these 
procedures. For example, in June 2007, the lender NovaStar paid $5 million to settle a borrower class 
action suit alleging that NovaStar failed to disclose to its prospective borrowers that it paid “yield 
spread premiums.” These are premiums paid to mo rtgage brokers (i.e., pers ons who solicit loans for 
buyers of property and then arrange a loan with  a bank or other financial institution). When the 
brokers negotiated interest rates th at were higher than the rate for which a borrower actually qualified, Chapter 9—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 2 
55 they received these “yield spread premiums.” For inst ance, if a buyer qualified for a prime loan at 6 
percent but was sold a subprime loan at a 12 percen t substantially rate, the mortgage broker received 
a commission representing a portion of the difference between these two rates. 
Additional lawsuits against the directors and officer s of these lenders alleged that they engaged in 
other fraudulent lending practices, including that they: (1) made misleading statements regarding loan 
disclosures and documents, (2) fabricated credit information, (3) created schemes in conjunction with 
real estate appraisers to inflate property values, (4) overcharged buyers on closing costs, and (5) paid 
illegal kickbacks and referral f ees to title insurance agencies.  
In many instances, the lawsuits assert that lenders simply failed to explain that after a 2- to 3-year 
period, the initial monthly payment would double or even triple. 
Discrimination Suits 
A number of suits claimed that African American and Hispanic customers were particular targets of 
risky and inappropriate loans which violated the Fair Housing and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts. 
Most frequently, the suits alleged that such buyers  were “steered” into high interest subprime loan, 
when, in fact they actually qualified for prime loans,  or at least those with substantially lower rates 
than those charged under subprime arrangements.  
“Equity Stripping” Suits 
Numerous consumer protection actions have been brought by various state attorneys general alleging 
that mortgage lenders induced customers to take out loans that they clearly could not afford. These 
have been termed “equity stripping” loans, wher eby minority and elderly customers were saddled 
with high fee/high interest loans, that were in tentionally designed to reduce their home equity 
positions to zero and, in addition, were obviously unaffordable given the borrowers’ relatively limited 
incomes. Similarly, such suits have also been brought against the directors and officers of major 
financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, on the theory that they encouraged and assisted lenders in predatory lending schemes , knowing they could package and sell these loans 
in the form of bonds, as discussed earlier. 
Investor Lawsuits 
The second major group of plaintiffs that emerged fr om the sub-prime mortgage lending/credit crisis 
were investors who purchased the mortgage-backed s ecurities backed by subp rime loans that later 
defaulted. The initial target of such lawsuits was th e directors and officers of the financial institutions 
from whom these MBSs were purchased.  
Additionally, investors have sued the major cr edit rating agencies who rated such instruments as 
investment grade. This is especially true since a number of agencies admitted to having worked with 
the investment banking firms that issued the mortgage-backed securities, making sure that they did, in 
fact, carry investment grade ratings even when any rational analysis would have indicated otherwise. 
Shareholders Lawsuits 
The next group of plaintiffs was shareholders in companies whose businesses were heavily involved in subprime lending and securitization. Given the crushing financial losses these companies suffered 
as a result of such activities, th e share prices of these companies dropped precipitously, thereby 
paving the way for securities class action claims. Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
56 Numerous class action suits were brought against mortgage lenders (e.g. Countrywide Financial), 
financial institutions that served as underwriters  of mortgage-backed securities (e.g., investment 
banking firms such as Merrill Lynch and Lehmann Brothers), providers of credit enhancement 
insurance (e.g., AIG and Bear Stearns), the credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s) 
and, of course, the directors and officers of all of these organizations.  
Lawsuits by Shareholders in “Collateral” Industries 
A number of other industries have also been severely impacted by the subprime lending/credit crisis, despite the fact that these industries did not actually loan funds for subprime mortgages or were involved at any stage of the securitization process.  
Home Builders 
Home builders have been particularly hard-hit b ecause the level of new home building since 2007 has 
plummeted. This has resulted in the country’s major home builders sustaining huge losses since early 2007, a fact that ultimately impacted th e shares of such companies’ stocks.  
Unrelated Industries 
In addition, there are companies completely ou tside the financial sector or home building sectors 
whose investment portfolios/balance sheets are laden with MBSs or other troubled assets that have been impacted by the sub-prime/credit crisis. The in teresting question is how far outside the financial 
sector claims against these kinds of companies will spread in the future. 
Claims from the Bernard Madoff Investment Ponzi Scheme  
In December 2008, it was revealed that Bernard Madoff, investment fund manager and former 
chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange, had enga ged in a massive investment Ponzi scheme that 
had defrauded investors of an estimated $50 billion. (Ponzi schemes operate by obtaining money from new investors, which is then used to pay off ex isting investors when they seek to withdraw monies 
from the investment. Eventually, however, Ponz i schemes collapse when cash inflows from new 
investors cease, or, when withdrawal requests from existing investors become so large that they 
cannot be met with the funds that are available.) What is important from the standpoint of this course 
is the fact that Madoff’s “activities” have already generated, and will likely continue to generate, 
substantial claims against a host of corporate directors and officers in a variety of industries. 
The Scheme, in Brief 
Madoff accepted money from numerous individuals a nd institutional investors (many of whom were 
charitable foundations). In return for a fee, Mado ff invested and managed these investors’ funds.  
The Myth 
By means of what he described as a unique hedgi ng strategy, what are known as option contracts, 
Madoff produced investment returns that, over more than two decades, consistently exceeded the return yielded by the S&P 500 Index—or so it appeared. Even in years during which the Index was down sharply, Madoff nevertheless managed to produce positive, and usually double-digit returns on 
the monies he invested for his clients. Those returns were not only fairly high but also consistent; in 
fact, he rarely had a losing month and never re ported a single losing year. Rather than offer 
suspiciously high returns (e.g. 20 to 40 percent annually) to all comers, Madoff offered solid but remarkably steady returns to an exclusive clientele, in both up and down markets.  Chapter 9—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 2 
57 Other Professionals Doubt the Returns 
A longtime friend of Madoff’s noted that “his rate of  return ...was never attention-grabbing, just solid 
12–13 percent year in, year out.” Robert Ivanhoe, chai rman of the real estate practice of the law firm 
Greenberg Traurig, added that Madoff increased his allure by actually refusing to accept some 
potential investors as his clients.  
But perhaps the most telling indictment of Madoff’s deception was the written testimony submitted to 
the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Fi nancial Services by financial analyst and fraud 
investigator Harry Markopolos. In it, Markopolos noted that “The biggest, most glaring tip-off that [Madoff’s claimed investment strategy] had to be a fraud was that [he] only reported 3 down months 
out of 87 months, whereas the S&P 500 was down 28 months during that time period. No money 
manager is only down 3.4 percent of the time. That  would be equivalent to a major league baseball 
player batting .966 and no one suspec ting that this player was cheating.” 
The Reality 
In truth, the profits Madoff claimed were nonexistent.  The monthly statements he issued to his clients 
were, in fact, fraudulent because following Madoff’s arr est, it was revealed that none of the monies he 
claimed to have invested during the previous 15 years were actually used to purchase various stocks, 
bonds, or options (as noted in his clients’ monthly statements). No one knows how much of his 
clients’ money he really lost, although the crimin al complaint against Madoff alleges that he lost 
more than $60 billion through the operation of his scheme. What is indeed certain is that these statements wildly exaggerated Madoff’s claimed su ccesses as a money manager. But he was able to 
create the appearance of such consistent profits for the following two reasons. 
A Continuing Inflow of New Investors—and New Money 
First, he continuously added new investors to his existing pool of clients. As a result, when his current investors sought to withdraw funds, he was alwa ys able to provide them with the money they 
requested, but only because it came  from new investors—not from profits earned on their funds.  
Charitable Trusts: a Source of Stability 
Second, what also aided Madoff was that a high perc entage of the monies he  managed belonged to 
charitable trusts, foundations, and endowments. By law, such trusts are required to withdraw at least 4 
percent of their funds annually (to maintain their tax exempt status). On the other hand, it is also rare for them to withdraw substantially more than that  percentage in any given year. Thus, Madoff would 
never be faced with a large “drawdown request” from even a single foundation’s account. Therefore, 
by targeting charities, Madoff substantially reduced  the threat of large withdrawals from any single 
client. 
The Unraveling 
What eventually unraveled his scheme, was that during 2008, the S&P 500 index dropped by 
approximately 40 percent. As a result, his investors began to panic, which produced calls for large 
withdrawals on a scale that Madoff had never previo usly experienced. . Eventually, the amounts of 
such withdrawal requests began to far exceed the sums he was able to garner from new clients; 
thereby, it became impossible to pay long-standing investors when they requested their money.  
 
 Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
58 Recognizing that withdrawal requests were essentia lly overwhelming his remaining available funds, 
Madoff had no choice but to turn himself into the authorities. Ironically, since the early 1990s, the 
SEC and other regulatory agencies had conducted nu merous investigations into his operations. 
However, Harry Markopolos has stated that the SEC employed incompetent investigators who actually did little investigation and/or hired pers ons who lacked the finance background that would 
have been required to adequately examine Ma doff’s operations. For this reason, a number of 
Madoff’s investors have brought suits against the SEC, alleging negligence in failing to detect the fraud that he was committing. 
Based on tips from countless investors and financial analysts, a multitude of investment professionals 
were convinced that Madoff’s hype r-consistent returns were far above any reasonable standard; they 
thus argued that his entire operation was fraudulent. They were eventually proven to be correct. 
What Are the Leading Claim Allegati ons against Corporate Directors and 
Officers? 
As would be expected, numerous class action la wsuits have already been filed against his 
organization, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, including the firm’s directors and 
officers.  
Feeder Funds: Madoff’s C onduit to Major Capital 
What is now emerging as a key source of claims associated with the scheme are those being filed against so-called “feeder funds.” Significantly, one reason Madoff was able to amass such a high 
dollar volume of funds was due, in part, to the f act investors were referred to him by financial 
institutions. In additional cases, these entities, w ho were in the business of managing money for 
others, simply sent Madoff their investors’ money—in return for a commission or fee. 
Who Were the Feeders?  
Among the types of financial institutions that sen t money to Madoff ‘s company, were commercial 
banks, investment banks, hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, and investment advisors. In fact, one of the key “portals” to the substantial volume of foreign investors’ funds through which Madoff 
gained access was through these so-called feeder funds.  
Barely 2 months after revelations  about Madoff’s scheme became public, by early February 2009, 12 
class action lawsuits had been filed against these en tities, and of course, against their directors and 
officers, as well. The suits allege that in referring such persons to and/or investing their money with 
Madoff, they failed to adequately assess and evaluate the true nature of his operations, and that as a 
result of such failures, these investors lost huge sums of money. 
Claims from Private Equity Operations  
Claims involving private equity operations involve la wsuits alleging damage to existing shareholders 
when public corporations are bought out by what are known as “private equity” groups. 
What is a Private Equity Group? 
Private equity groups raise money in private markets (i.e., from institutional investors such as pension 
funds or from wealthy individuals), rather than from public markets (such as major stock exchanges) 
and then use these monies to make various types of investments. Private equity groups acquire 
companies by buying all of the shares of a compan y listed on a public stock exchange (such as the Chapter 9—Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims: 
Part 2 
59 New York Stock Exchange). Having acquired the comp any in this manner, the private equity firm 
group then brings in a new management team, in an attempt to make the newly-purchased company 
more profitable, and thus more va luable. Ultimately, the private equity group resells the company at a 
later date, hopefully for a higher price per share th an the one for which it was originally acquired on 
the public market. 
How Do Claims from Private Equity Deals Arise?  
As already noted throughout this course, “traditi onal” merger and acquisition transactions raise the 
level of D&O claim exposure for a company and its ma nagement given the conflicts of interest such 
transactions create. In contrast, private equity buyouts are fundamentally different from these 
standard transactions in which one public compan y buys out another public company. In the latter, 
management acts as an auctioneer and seeks the hi ghest possible price for their company. But in 
private equity buyouts, management functions as a buyer, whose aim is to purchase the firm for the lowest possible price. Unlike “traditional” merger  and acquisition transactions, in private equity 
buyouts, management usually remains with and retains a significant equity stake in the new 
organization that emerges after the private equity buyout is completed. This situation provides the 
basis of a claim by stockholders who were bought out by the private equity group and its management “partners.” Those stockholders then assert that they  received an unfairly low per share price when the 
private equity deal was consummated.  
Claims from private equity operations reached their peak in 2007. Given the current recession, such 
claims have all but disappeared because, like IPOs , private equity buyouts rarely occur. However, 
such exposures could again increase, once the recessi on ends and the economy returns to its normal 
condition.

Parallel Proceedings 
As noted at length, the size of settlements in securities class action claims against directors and 
officers has increased dramatically in recent year s. Less publicized, and yet no less important, is a 
similar increase in the frequency of proceedings against directors and officers that are separate from, 
but related to and therefore parallel to securities class action lawsuits. This chapter sets forth an 
overview of the four types of “parallel proceeding s”: (1) derivative claims, (2) opt-out lawsuits, (3) 
ERISA stock drop claims, and (4) regulatory and criminal proceedings.  
Derivative Claims 
A derivative claim is a type of lawsuit brought by one or more stockholders—on behalf of the 
corporation—rather than on their own behalf of indi vidual stockholders. The a lleged harm must be to 
the corporation as a whole, rather than to one or  more shareholders. Therefore, any recovery in 
derivative suits inures to the benefit of the corporation,  and is therefore paid to the corporation, rather 
than to the shareholder(s) who institute the action. 
Common Breaches of Duty Alleged in Derivative Claims 
The breaches of duty most commonly alleged in derivative actions against directors and officers are listed in Exhibit 10.1.  
Exhibit 10.1 
Most Common Allegations in Derivative Lawsuits  
• Transactions involving undisclosed conflict s of interest, self-dealing, or personal 
appropriation of corporate opportunities  
• Approval of improper or excessive corporate expenditures  
• Imprudent investment procedures  
• Self-interested, improper, or inadequat e consideration of takeover offers  
• Improper payment of dividends  
• Improper payment of executive compensation 
• General neglect and mismanagement of the corporation  
 Although the practice of filing a derivative laws uit in conjunction with a securities class action 
lawsuit is not new, the frequency of that practice continues to increase. In creasingly, securities class 
action lawsuits are being handled (and effectively controlled) by a small group of sophisticated and 
highly experienced plaintiff law firms. Consequent ly, other law firms that are sometimes excluded Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
64 from these class action lawsuits will often file a deri vative suit, in an attempt to obtain a fee award 
when the class action case settles.  
A Notable Derivative Claim 
In recent years, one of the most notable and well-publicized derivative suits was a claim brought 
against the Walt Disney Company. The suit alleged that Michael Ovitz, who was hired to serve as the 
company’s president, by Disney’s then-CEO Mich ael Eisner, received excessive pay. Specifically, 
Mr. Ovitz received more than $140 million in comp ensation and severance, after a “falling-out” with 
Mr. Eisner—despite having worked at Disney for only 16 months. Shareholders alleged that the 
directors and officers were negligent in agreeing to an employment contract that provided such rich 
compensation, despite such a short tenure with the organization. The shareholders alleged that the 
excessive payment damaged the corporation.  
The Court’s Findings 
Ultimately, the Delaware Chancery Court found in fa vor of the company’s directors and officers. The 
court ruled that while Mr. Ovitz’s compensation package was indeed excessive, the directors and 
officers were not grossly negligent in agreeing to it. The court cited the business judgment rule 
(discussed in Chapter 6 of this course), as the means by which Disney’s directors and officers could 
justify hiring Mr. Ovitz, albeit at an exorbitant cost. The court concluded that the directors and 
officers considered Mr. Ovitz’s services so valuable  as to justify the high price of his employment 
contract. While the outcome of the decision was disastrous, because the process by which the decision 
was arrived at was appropriate, the court did not hold the directors and officers liable. 
Opt-Out Lawsuits 
In addition to the derivative lawsuit, plaintiff law fi rms also file what are termed individual “opt-out” 
claims on behalf of a single institutional investor (e.g., a bank, an insurance company, a pension fund), rather than being part of the class action. 
Why “Opt-Out”? 
By bringing a lawsuit that is separate from the larg er class action lawsuit, these individual plaintiffs 
can sometimes negotiate a larger settlement recovery than if the plaintiffs were passive beneficiaries 
of the larger class action lawsuit.  
Advantages for Directors and Officers 
Opt-out suits may, under certain circumstances, be beneficial for corporate defendants.  
First, such settlements may be especially benefi cial when one (or more) claimants is a large 
institutional plaintiff. For example, assume that a major pension fund is seeking substantial damages 
from a corporation. After the corporation settles sep arately with the pension fund, the corporation 
may only have to deal with the relatively small (individually, at least) investors who comprise the 
members of the class action lawsuit. In effect, it may be ridding itself of a major plaintiff by making a 
separate settlement and thus reducing the bulk, or at least a major portion of its exposure in the 
process. 
Second, when faced simultaneously with a class action claim and an opt-out claim, corporate 
defendants may be required to respond to multiple  motions and discovery requests in each of the 
separate lawsuits, which may be filed in different  courts throughout the country. Given the rapid Chapter 10—Parallel Proceedings 
65 accumulation of defense costs necessitated by such ac tivities, it is often in the directors and officers 
best interests to settle the opt-out claim expeditious ly. This allows the directors/officers to conserve 
policy limits available under their D&O policy, so that funds will be available to settle the class 
action claim.  
Advantages for Opt-Out Plaintiffs 
From the standpoint of a plaintiff, a separate, opt -out settlement affords two advantages. First, it 
provides for an accelerated recovery of damages. Th is is preferable to waiting as long as a decade, the 
period of time sometimes required to settle a class action lawsuit.  
Second, by settling on an accelerated basis, an opt -out plaintiff” obtains earlier access to the D&O 
insurance proceeds that re main available. Often, the protract ed litigation process characteristic of 
class action claims will rapidly deplete D&O policy li mits, through the expenditure of defense costs 
and before claim settlements have even been made . Therefore, opt-out plaintiffs often benefit by 
settling on an accelerated basis, before D&O insurance proceeds have been exhausted by defense 
costs required during extended litigation. 
ERISA “Stock Drop” Litigation 
The proliferation and popularity of 401(k) retirement plans has created yet another substantial liability exposure for corporate directors and officers. Given the fact that such plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA),  what are termed “ERISA stock drop” (or less 
commonly referred to as “ERISA tag-along” suits) have become commonplace in recent years. 
401(k) Monies Invested in Company Sto ck: The Trigger for ERISA Stock Drop 
Litigation 
A high percentage of many corporations’ 401(k) plans include within such plans’ investment choices 
the option to purchase company stock. ERISA stock drop claims arise when the market price of company stock drops substantially, an event causi ng 401(k) employee-plan holders to suffer losses in 
their individual accounts. Such losses, if they ar e large enough, often result in class action lawsuits 
against the directors and officers of the organiza tions that sponsor the plans. In these lawsuits, 
employee-plaintiffs allege that the directors and o fficers were fiduciaries of the 401(k) plans, and that 
the conduct required to administer such plans is governed by the provisions found within ERISA. 
Concentration of Employer  Stock in 401(k) Plans 
Studies have indicated that, 7 years after the Enron collapse, company stock is still the single largest 
employee holding in 401(k) plans. More specifically, studies have shown that approximately 20 
percent of all 401(k) monies are invested in company stock. In addition, the study revealed that one in 
five plan participants have at least half thei r retirement money invested in company shares.  
Why Concentration of Employer Stock in 401(k)’s Remains High 
Companies that promote the ownership of company stock in 401(k) plans believe that encouraging employees to own stock creates an “ownership cu lture” in which employees will be even more 
committed to the firm’s success. Such companies often match employee contributions on a dollar-for-
dollar basis when these monies are used to buy company stock. This compares to the typical 401(k) plan that matches only 50 percent of an employee’s contributions and only up to 6 percent of the amount contributed. Programs of this nature enc ourage heavy investment in company stock by 401(k) 
plan participants.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
66 Specific Allegations against Directors a nd Officers in ERISA Stock Drop Cases 
Following are the most common breaches of duties alleged against directors and officers, in 
conjunction with ERISA “stock drop” claims. Employee-plaintiffs typically assert that directors and officers: 
• Deceived plan participants and beneficiaries by providing false and misleading information 
about the company’s finances, which induced the employees to buy shares of the company’s 
stock.  
• Failed to disclose material information about  the company and its financial condition and 
performance, either in statements to the general public, to shareholders, or to employees.  
• Failed to disclose such information to other plan fiduciaries (such as investment advisors and brokers) who had responsibility for investing plan assets.  
• Failed to correct misleading statements made by other officers and plan fiduciaries, and 
failing to adequately monitor wrongdoing by other plan fiduciaries.  
Although normally smaller than the settlement amount agreed to in the related securities litigation, 
settlements in ERISA stock drop litigation have nevertheless been substantial. 
Securities Class Action Litigation ver sus ERISA Stock Drop Litigation  
The following example will illustrate  the difference between the losses su stained by shareholders in a 
securities class action and those suffered by employ ee 401(k) plan holders in the “parallel” ERISA 
stock drop litigation. 
The Scenario 
Assume that a company’s 1,000 employees hold a total of 1 million shares of the company’s stock within their 401(k) plans. Also assume that in addition to these sharehol ders, an additional 5,000 
shareholders own a total of 5 million shares of the company’s stock. Both groups—the employee shareholders and the non-employee shareholders—a llege that the directors and officers of the 
company had been hiding losses for a 2-year period and that when the true condition of the firm was 
announced, it was required to restate its financials . The day of the announcement, the stock dropped 
from $75 per share to $45 per share.  
The Securities Class Action Claim 
In this lawsuit, the class of 5,000 shareholders w ill allege that they suffered a loss of $150 million 
(i.e., $75 – $45=$30 per share loss x 5 million shares= $150 million loss). 
The ERISA Stock Drop Claim 
In this lawsuit, the class of 1,000 employee 401(k) pl an participants will allege that they suffered a 
loss of $30 million (i.e., $75 – $45=$30 per share loss x 1 million shares= $30 million loss). 
Regulatory and Criminal Proceedings 
In recent years, claims by the SEC, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other regulators have 
increased significantly. Since 2001, the SEC budget has more than doubled, and the size of its staff 
has increased by about 30 percent.  Similarly, the number of enforcement proceedings brought by the 
SEC has increased dramatically in the last several years. Other regulators have likewise become much Chapter 10—Parallel Proceedings 
67 more active in bringing civil proceedings against companies and their directors and officers. The 
frequency of criminal proceedings against director s and officers has also continued to increase in 
recent years. As a result, individual defendants in  securities class action lawsuits are also frequently 
the subjects of “parallel” regulatory or criminal i nvestigations and proceedings. In effect, a “garden 
variety” class action claim against directors and offi cers often morphs into a regulatory investigation 
and/or criminal proceeding against them. 
Regulatory Investigations and Class Action Claims 
What begins as an investigation by a regulatory ag ency frequently has the poten tial to evolve into a 
class action lawsuit by a firm’s shareholders. For example, at one point, the DOJ and the SEC were 
conducting investigations of more than 100 corporations in conjunction with  illegal option backdating 
practices (as discussed earlier in this chapter). The v ast majority of these investigations did not result 
in criminal charges or fines and penalties against the companies being investigated. (Although in one 
notable case, former United Healthcare CEO Willia m McGuire was required to pay back $418 
million in option-related compensation that he had obtained illegally.) In addition, approximately 33 
of the firms that were investigated eventually had class action lawsuits brought against them by 
shareholders in conjunction with their option backdating practices.  
Criminal Prosecutions and Class Action Claims 
Just as regulatory proceedings and investigations are frequently co nducted on a parallel basis with 
class action lawsuits, such actions are frequently  intertwined with criminal indictments and 
prosecutions. For example, in addition to the wa ve of class action lawsuits brought against the 
directors and officers of Enron, criminal indi ctments and prosecutions were conducted against 
numerous Enron executives, most notably Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, the 
company’s former CEO, COO, and CFO. (The latter three, and others, were convicted). 
Special Issues Associated with Parallel Proceedings 
These parallel regulatory and criminal matters create unique problems for the defendants.  
Discovery Issues  
Regulators frequently have extremely broad discove ry rights (much more so than do plaintiffs’ 
attorneys in class action litigation). In addition, re gulators tend to conduct their investigations more 
rapidly than do class action atto rneys. In some instances, courts have required defendant 
directors/officers to share with the securities class action plaintiffs’ attorneys, documents given to the 
government in connection with its investigation or  proceeding. Unfortunately, the fact that such 
parties now have access to this often damaging info rmation heightens the directors’/officers’ liability 
exposure in the class action case. As a result, the evidentiary “road map” developed by regulators can sometimes be effectively followed by class ac tion attorneys in prosecuting their case against 
corporate directors and officers. This puts these defendants at a tremendous disadvantage in the securities class action case, compared to situations where regulatory/criminal investigations are not 
being conducted. 
  
 
 Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
68 Burdensome Defense Procedures  
In addition, since the regulatory proceedings are ra rely consolidated or coordinated with the class 
action litigation, director/officer defendants must ofte n engage in duplicate a nd overlapping discovery 
activities (i.e., taking the time to provide depositions  to both regulatory agencies and to attorneys who 
bring class action lawsuits).  
Defense Coverage Issues: The Shrinking Limits Problem 
Yet another difficulty associated with parallel procee dings is the fact that defense costs necessitated 
by criminal indictments and regulatory investiga tions can rapidly deplete D&O policy limits because 
under D&O policies, insurers are obligated to defe nd insureds when they are criminally indicted 
and/or when a regulatory agency investigates the directors and officers or the corporation. The monies 
expended for providing defense in these situations might otherwise be needed to defend and settle 
class action claims against directors and officers.  
“White Hats” versus “Black Hats” 
The “competition” for D&O policy limits between so called “white hats” (directors/officers who were 
merely negligent) and “black hats” (directors/offi cers who were also guilty of criminal conduct), is 
especially problematic in securities class action clai ms that also involve parallel proceedings. In the 
Enron case, for example, where a number of officers were convicted of criminal conduct, the monies 
required to defend them exhausted Enron’s D&O policy limits. This left nothing to defend the 
directors whose conduct, while negligent, was not criminal; a fact that probably explains why these 
“white hat” directors were ultimately required to contribute to the class action securities settlement 
with personal funds.

69 Chapter 10 Review Questions  
1. Sensing a growing opportunity, lawyers working at the law firm Manny, Moe, and Curly 
(MM&C) would like to participate in securities class action lawsuits. However, nearly all of 
these suits are handled by law firms with a prove n track record. MM&C might still be able to

a. Derivative suits. 
b. Single-plaintiff suits. 
c. Secondary suits.

2. A combination of two major stockholders’ opt- out lawsuits and a shareholder class action 
lawsuit against Alphabet Soup Company directors and officers could exhaust the firm’s 
directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance li mits and leave the corporation in hot water. 
The plaintiffs most likely to r ecover D&O insurance proceeds are: 
a. Opt-out plaintiffs because major sharehol ders who settle on an accelerated basis 
generally have earlier access to insurance proceeds. 
b. Opt-out plaintiffs because their claims will pr obably be settled faster than the class-action 
claim.  
c. Shareholders participating in the class acti on lawsuit because their claims will probably 
be settled faster than the opt-out plaintiffs’ claim. 
d. Shareholders participating in the class acti on lawsuit because they always have better 
lawyers. 
3. Last Chance Company employees hold 100,000 shar es of Last Chance stock within their 
401k plans. When a financial restatement is announced, Last Chance stock drops from $50 per share to $30 per share. Alleging that Last Chance directors and officers had concealed the 
company’s true financial cond ition prior to the financial restatement, employees bring an 
ERISA stock drop claim alleging that they suffered a loss of: 
a. $2 million. 
b. $3 million.  
c. $5 million. 
d. Confidence in company management. 
 
Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1. a. Law firms that are excluded from a class action lawsuit often file a derivate suit in an attempt to 
obtain a fee award when the class action case settles. 
2. b. Opt-out claims handled on an accelerated basi s can recover D&O proceeds before the policy’s

Underwriting Directors & Officers Liability Insurance: Part 1 
This chapter begins with a discussion of the data s ources used by underwriters to evaluate and price a 
D&O risk. Next, it addresses the first two of th e four major D&O underwriting factors that 
underwriters consider: (1) financ ial situation and (2) industry/competitive position. Chapter 12 
examines the next two factors—(3) internal company issues and (4) composition/operation of the 
board of directors—that D&O underwriters also evaluate when pricing a D&O risk. 
Underwriting Data 
Much of the key data required to underwrite a D&O policy is provided in the application form. In 
addition to a completed application, there are a nu mber of other items, which are listed in Exhibit 
11.1, that organizations must usually provide duri ng the process of being evaluated for directors and 
officers liability coverage.  
Exhibit 11.1 
Items Submitted with a D&O Application  
• Copies of the corporation’s latest annual report 
• Copies of all proxy material 
• Corporate bylaws 
• A list of directors and officers (including subsidiary organizations), with biographical 
information  
• The firm’s most recent Dun and Bradstreet report  
• Copies of the most recent financial inform ation filed with the SEC (normally 10K and 10Q 
reports)   
Annual Report 
The annual report is the most important piece of in formation used by underwriters, because no single 
document conveys as broad an overview of the co mpany. A company’s annual report sets forth a 
general description of a company’s business, discusses current issues and conditions affecting the business, and contains detailed financial data that explain how the company achieved its earnings 
during the most current fiscal year. The majority of  publicly-traded companies release annual reports 
in the spring because their fiscal years usually run from January 1, 20XX through December 31, 
20XX. An annual report contains financial data covering this period.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
72 Annual Report Contents 
Annual reports usually contain: (1) a chairman’s re port, (2) detailed financial data, (3) an auditor’s 
report on corporate governance, (4) the corporate mission statement, (5) the corporate governance 
statement of compliance, (6) a roster of, and statement of, directors’ responsibilities, and (7) an 
invitation to the company’s annual meeting. 
Financial Data 
The financial section of an annual report normally c ontains a(n): (1) auditor’s report on the firm’s 
financial statements, (2) balance sheet, (3) statemen t of retained earnings, (4) income statement, (5) 
cash flow statement, (6) notes to the financial st atements, and (7) a statement of the company’s 
accounting policies.  
Proxy Material 
A proxy statement is a statement required when a co rporation solicits the votes of its shareholders on 
a particular issue. Such statements most often c oncern mergers and acquisitions, the election of board 
members, and matters relating to director/executive compensation. Proxy statements must be filed 
with the SEC.  
The statement generally includes: (1) voting proce dures and information on the issue being decided, 
(2) background information about the company's nominated directors, (3) details of director/executive 
compensation, and (4) a breakdown of audit and non-a udit fees paid to the auditor. Such material is 
important from an underwriting standpoint because it indicates the manner and extent to which the 
board communicates critical information to its shareholders.  
Corporate Bylaws 
A company’s corporate bylaws describe the internal  rules that govern its management. They provide 
particular insight into the frequency of board meetings, types of board committees, the number of 
board members, and criteria for board membership. A key aspect of a corporation’s bylaws concerns 
the procedures for and conditions under which the company will indemnify directors/officers for claims incurred in conjunction with their service to the organization. These kinds of details assist an 
underwriter in evaluating the effectiveness with  which the board will be able to operate. 
Roster of Direct ors and Officers 
The essence of any D&O risk is the integrity,  knowledge, and experience possessed by those who 
occupy the roles of directors and officers. The rost er of directors and officers (which also includes 
their committee assignments) provides an underwrite r with the information required to analyze the 
backgrounds of the people who occupy these important positions. 
Dun and Bradstreet Report 
Dun and Bradstreet is a company that provid es credit information on businesses and corporations. 
Their reports, referred to as “D&B’s,” use a patented Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS). This unique approach compares and contrasts the fi nancial data of a specific company to those in 
similar industries. In addition to D&O underwrite rs, the DUNS system is utilized by every major 
bank, lender, finance company, and federal ag ency in evaluating the financial condition and 
creditworthiness of virtually all businesses. Chapter 11—Underwriting Directors & O fficers Liability Insurance: Part 1 
73 SEC Reports 
Public companies are required to make regular filings with the SEC, which underwriters also review 
carefully. The filings consist of the company’s ke y financial statements, which must be submitted 
each quarter. Underwriters are especially interested in such filings because, compared to the financial 
data in the company’s annual report, they provid e a more current picture of a company’s finances. 
Financial Situation  
The actual pricing of a D&O policy is related—a lthough not strictly a function of—the dollar amount 
of a firm's total assets. A number of other importa nt factors are also considered in developing a 
premium for a D&O policy. Accordingly, pricin g D&O liability insurance is a highly subjective 
process. In arriving at premiums, D&O underwrite rs begin by analyzing a company’s financial 
position.  
The key financial areas include a firm’s: 
• Profitability  
• Leverage  
• Accounting and financial reporting practices 
• Liquidity  
• Stock price volatility 
Profitability 
Profitability is a concern to D&O underwriters given the strong correlation between lack of profit and 
the incidence of claims against directors and offi cers. Thus, the ability of a firm to generate 
acceptable levels of profits for its investors is the single most important financial indicator evaluated 
by underwriters.  
Profitability: The Double-Edge d Sword of D&O Underwriting 
Despite the fact that profitability is generally recognized as a key D&O underwriting factor, it should 
be remembered that Enron was “profitable” right  up to the moment it declared bankruptcy.  
Profit: An Illusive Concept 
In recent years, “profit” has become an accounting construct rather than an infallible indicator of a 
company's long- or short-term viability. Accordingl y, what is most important from an underwriting 
standpoint is to understand exactly where profit is coming from and how it is derived. In fact, certain 
companies are excellent D&O risks—despite the fact  that they report losses year after year (e.g., 
development-stage biotech firms that have products on the drawing board, but that have not yet been 
sold). Profit alone, may—or may not—say very much about a particular company's propensity to have a claim made against its directors and officers. 
One leading underwriter captured this dilemma best  when he commented that “companies managing 
to report ever-increasing profits a nd consistently exceed Wall Street's expectations by wide margins 
are arguably the scariest companies out there!” Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
74 Countrywide Financial: A Case Study in the Sometimes-Illusory Nature of “Profit” 
In an October 1, 2007, New York Times op-ed piece, Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman 
described the problems faced by Countrywide Fi nancial, the nation's largest subprime lender, 
comparing them to the Enron situation. A onetime darling of growth-enamored Wall Street analysts, 
Countrywide's shares fell by more than 50 percent during the prior year. The company was 
technically insolvent when it was acquired by Bank of America in January 2008. 
The op-ed noted similarities betw een both Enron and Countrywide in terms of (1) stellar earnings 
immediately prior to announced internal pr oblems, (2) high CEO compensation relative to 
competitors, (3) CEO stock sales just prior to la rge share price drops, and (4) radiant business press 
coverage, in which both Enron's Ken Lay and Countrywide's CEO, Angelo Mozilo, were lauded not 
only as great businessmen—but also as great human beings. 
Quality of Earnings vers us Quantity of Earnings 
Countrywide was a textbook case of how the quality of a company's earnings—in this case, from 
mortgage loans made to people lacking the financ ial wherewithal to repay them—took a back seat to 
the quantity of those earnings in Wall Street’s assessment of the company. If a company consistently reports sales and profit growth far above industry averages and receives exuberant write-ups in the 
financial press, underwriters must look more deeply into the true nature of the company's operations. 
Problems could, and often do, lie ahead. 
Leverage 
A debt to equity ratio provides an underwriter with in sight into a firm's financial structure. This ratio 
indicates the relationship of debt to equity financi ng and the degree to which a company is leveraged 
(i.e., the portion of debt used to finance the bus iness). Many companies utilize greater leverage (i.e., 
debt), to increase performance results or stretch limited resources. Heightened leverage creates heightened risks.  
Interpret Debt to Equity Ratios Carefully 
A company's debt to equity ratio must be interpreted carefully. From a creditor's standpoint, a high proportion of owners' equity is desirable. This is because equity provides a substantial protective 
buffer of owners' investment for creditors in the event the company suffers a loss. However, from an 
owner's standpoint, a high proportion of owners' e quity may or may not be desirable. If borrowed 
funds can be used by a business to generate earnings in excess of the after-tax cost of the interest on such borrowed funds, a lower percentage of  owners' equity may be desirable.  
Conversely, too low an equity ratio (i.e., t oo much debt) may be hazardous from the owner's 
standpoint. Underwriters should be leery of firms that appear heavily dependent on debt and whose 
ability to meet debt repayment requirements is su spect. For such firms, a business recession could 
result in operating losses and shrinkages in the values of assets (such as receivables and inventories). This, in turn, could lead to an inability to meet fixed payments for interest and principal on debt. 
Similarly, underwriters should avoid firms that are especially vulnerable to changes in interest rates, such as companies that maintain a high percentage of “floating rate” debt, the cost of which could 
increase substantially.  Chapter 11—Underwriting Directors & O fficers Liability Insurance: Part 1 
75 Accounting and Financial Reporting Practices 
Accounting and financial reporting practices are a ke y component for underwriters to evaluate in 
developing an understanding of the company’s fina ncial picture. The ten examples noted in Exhibit 
11.2 are the kinds of accounting and financial reporting practices that are especially problematic 
 
Exhibit 11.2 
10 Problematic Accounting and Financial Reporting Practices  
• Complex business arrangements that are difficult to understand and appear to serve little 
purpose from a practical standpoint (e.g., Enron had numerous “off-balance-sheet 
partnerships” that were used to hide excessive debt).  
• Changes in auditors over accounting or auditing disagreements (i.e., the new auditors 
agree with management and the old auditors did not, which is why they were replaced).  
• Overly optimistic news releases or sharehol der communications, with the chief executive 
officer acting as “evangelist” to convince inve stors of future potential growth (e.g., ex-
Enron CEO Kenneth Lay assuring employee 401K holders that the st ock has “never been 
a better buy” only a few months before the firm filed for bankruptcy protection, and after he had sold massive amounts of his personal holdings of Enron shares).  
• Unusually rapid growth and profitability that  is significantly be tter than competitors, 
despite a lack of substantive difference in  the nature of operations (e.g., Countrywide 
Mortgage generated outsize returns compared to its competitors, despite essentially 
identical business practices). 
• Inability to generate cash flows from operat ions, while reporting significant earnings 
growth (a sign of earnings manipulation). 
• A consistently close or exact match between  the reported results and planned results; for 
example, results are always exactly on budget or managers who always achieve 100 
percent of bonus opportunities (yet another  sign that earnings are being “managed”). 
• Frequent instances of differences of opi nion regarding the accounting treatment of 
various items, between management and external auditors.  
• A pattern of shipping most of the month's or  quarter's sales on the last day of the month 
or on the last day of the quarter.  
• Unusual balance sheet changes or abnormal changes in trends of important financial 
statement relationships (e.g., receivables growing faster than revenues or accounts 
payable that keep getting delayed).  
• Atypical accounting policies, particularly fo r revenue recognition and cost deferrals (e.g., 
recognizing revenues before products have ev en been shipped, a practice known as “bill 
and hold”).  
Liquidity 
Adequate liquidity (i.e., liquid assets less current lia bilities) is important to a company, given the 
possibility of unforeseen emergencies (e.g., a sharp downturn in sales during a recession), as well as 
unanticipated business opportunities (e.g., the opportu nity to expand into a new product line). In 
addition, a firm's inability to accumulate suffici ent working capital could indicate poor financial 
management. Lastly, what constitutes a reasonable amount of liquidity varies with the degree of 
uncertainty inherent in a given industry group. For example, a high-tech company would need considerable working capital, given continuous inn ovation in that industry and the need for rapid 
introduction of new products.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
76 Liquidity and Lines of Credit 
Existing lines of credit are an important component of a firm’s liquidity position. Companies must 
have adequate lines of credit in place in the even t that profitable business opportunities emerge or, 
alternatively, unforeseen problems arise. The inab ility to establish and maintain adequate lines of 
credit may indicate poor relationships with the banking industry.  
Stock Price Volatility 
Companies whose share prices have historically b een significantly impacted by even minor events, 
have a tendency to produce shareholder class action claims. Thus, firms with volatile stock prices produce a “caution flag” for many underwriters. Th ere is, however, some disagreement on this point, 
because many businesses that exhibit volatile stock prices have not had a history of class action 
claims made against them. Conversely, numerous co mpanies with relatively stable share prices have 
been frequently involved in such litigation. In addition, volatility is related to a firm’s particular 
industry group. Therefore, stock price volatility/stab ility should be viewed as one of several important 
finance-related underwriting factors. 
Industry/Competitive Position 
A firm's competitive position in a given industry encompasses four significant factors: market share, competitive structure of the industry, revenue sources, and industry group.  
Market Share 
As has been emphasized throughout this course, me rger and acquisition activity frequently gives rise 
to claims. Therefore, firms with a relatively sma ll market share (e.g., 5 percent or less in a given 
industry or product type) are attractive takeover candidates and such companies should be carefully underwritten. However, even industry leaders ar e not immune to takeover attempts, given the 
emergence of creative financing techniques in the 1980s, such as leveraged buy-outs, whereby takeovers of multibillion dollar cor porations have been almost completely financed by debt. 
Competitive Structure of the Industry 
The degree of competition within an industry is a nother factor that underwriters must assess. Firms 
engaged in highly competitive industries where ma rkets are saturated with products and are 
characterized by overcapacity, are especially ri sky. Such problems are exacerbated when the 
industry's products are subject to rapid obsol escence, as was the case with  most high-tech firms 
during the 1999–2002 period in which firms in th is industry were subject to chaotic earnings 
fluctuation.  
Revenue Sources 
Companies dependent on a few large customers for a significant portion of their revenues are generally poor D&O risks. (This is especially true when profit margins are d eclining within the entire 
industry.) For such firms, the loss of only a handful  of key customers can cause earnings to plunge, 
thereby increasing the firm's susceptibility to claims.  
Consumer versus Business-Dependent Companies 
In addition, firms whose products are purchased largely by other businesses—rather than by 
consumers—are much more vulnerable to wide swings  in earnings and, ultimately, claims against its 
directors and officers. Many of the bankruptcies and financial difficulties experienced by high-tech Chapter 11—Underwriting Directors & O fficers Liability Insurance: Part 1 
77 firms from 2000 to 2002 can be explained by the overa ll lack of investment spending by corporations 
during this period. Accordingly, firms whose cust omers are principally other businesses are riskier, 
from a D&O standpoint, because consumer spending is  considerably less volatile than spending by 
corporations. For example, the share prices of consumer products manufacturers such as Kraft, 
Proctor & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson, were not as severely impacted by the 2007–09 stock market plunge, as were heavy equipment manufactu rers that sell almost exclusively to other 
businesses, like Caterpillar and Deere & Company. 
Industry Group  
The industry group in which a company operates corr elates significantly with D&O claim activity. 
During the past decade, the pattern that has emerged is one in which a particular industry group bears 
the brunt of numerous claims, as discussed below.  
1999–2002: The High-Tech Claim Wave 
From the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, approxi mately 56 percent of all federal class action 
securities claims were filed against companies involved in three broad industry groups: computer services, telecommunications, and electronics. 
 2007–2009: The Banking-Financial Services-Real Estate Wave  
Just as technology companies were the most su sceptible to claims during the 1999-2002 period, 
during the years 2007-2008 and in early 2009, banks, brokerages, and real estate/construction-related 
industries bore the brunt of the claims onslaught. The Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse (SCAC) and Cornerstone Research, for the year ending 2008, indicated the extent to 
which claims were heavily concentrated by indus try group. Specifically, approximately half of the 
suits involved some aspect of the credit meltdown, since 103 such suits named firms in the financial 
industry as defendants, including 55 percent of the financial companies in the S&P 500 Index. 
As was pointed out by Kevin LaCroix in the D&O Diary,  of the 152 subprime and credit crisis-
related securities lawsuits that have been filed as of February 4, 2009, 117 of them have involved 
companies or other entities with standard industrial classification codes (SIC) in the 6000 series (finance, insurance, and real estate). And of the 18 entities that have been sued but that have no SIC 
Code designated, these entities are heavily populated by mutual funds, private equity firms, hedge 
funds, and foreign firms whose shares are not traded on U.S. exchanges. 
Given such data, underwriters will add a significant premium loading to firms whose businesses are 
concentrated within an industry or industry group that is part of a D&O securities litigation “wave.”

   Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
80  
  
 
   81 Chapter 12 
Underwriting Directors & Officers Liability Insurance: Part 2 
This chapter will examine the other two broad areas considered by D&O underwriters: internal 
company factors and composition/operation of the board of directors. 
Internal Company Factors 
The third general area evaluated by underwriters involves the specific circumstances particular to an 
individual company. The following paragraphs discuss these areas. 
Merger and Acquisition Activity 
As stated often within this course, D&O claim susceptibility is related to the frequency of a 
company's involvement in merger and acquisiti on activity. M&A activity presents a number of 
problematic issues, all of which can lead to claims, as follows.  
• Acquiring companies  are always vulnerable to criticism that the purchase price paid for the 
company it acquired was excessive.  
• Acquired companies’  directors and officers have a vested interest in preserving their own 
positions and are naturally predisposed to rejecti ng a takeover offer, even those clearly in the 
best interest of the stockholders. Moreover, when they accept such an offer, the directors and officers are vulnerable to criticism that the offer was inadequate. 
As a result, a company with a proclivity for M&A activity is usually perceived by underwriters as a higher-than-average claim risk. 
Breadth/Concentration of Stock Ownership 
The more widely held a stock, the greater the chan ce that some party owning it will bring suit against 
the organization. For this reason, closely-held pub lic companies have a dramatically lower level of 
claim frequency, compared to those with more diffused, public stock ownership. A closely-held 
public company is one in which a high percentage of  the firm’s stock (e.g., 50 percent or more) is 
owned by the firm’s directors and officers or other so-called “insiders,” yet is also held by members 
of the public and is traded on one or more of the large national stock exchanges. (This is distinct from 
a privately-held company in which all of a comp any’s shares are owned by directors/officers/other 
insiders and the company’s shares are not traded on a public exchange.) 
 Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
82 Underwriters are leery of publicly-held companies in which one or more out siders hold large blocks 
of a firm's stock. Such persons (or institutions, in some cases) have a great deal at stake in the firm's 
fortunes and are therefore prime candidates for bringing suits at the first sign of a business downturn. 
(D&O liability policies, do, however, often contain ex clusions that bar coverage for suits brought by 
individuals owning more than 10 percent, and in so me cases, more than 5 percent, of a company’s 
outstanding shares.)  
Future, Company-Specific Risks  
A key risk underwriting factor for any individual company is whether or not the firm is susceptible to 
a single event or change that could substantially  alter the company’s fortunes. Examples of such 
vulnerabilities (but certainly not exhaustive of the going-forward vulnerabiliti es faced by companies) 
include: (1) dependence on a single customer, contract, product, or supplier (often typical of manufacturers of industrial equipment); (2) a comp any holding a patent on a major product (e.g., a 
pharmaceutical manufacturer) that is about to ex pire; (3) a company dependent upon a natural 
resource that is in short supply and/or whose price can fluctuate wildly (e.g., an airline’s dependence 
upon fuel prices); or (4) a company awaiting the outcome of pending, high-stakes litigation.  
Public Offerings and Repurchases 
Companies that frequently either (1) repurchase shares  of their own stock or (2) sell additional shares 
of stock to the public are sometimes pe rceived unfavorably by underwriters.  
With respect to repurchases, equity holders often obj ect to the fact that the corporation should have 
been able to find uses for the firm's capital that  were potentially more productive than repurchasing its 
own stock.  
As respects public sales of additional shares in th e company, such stock offerings occasionally trigger 
lawsuits from stockholders who are unhappy about the dilution of their equity that results from these 
offerings.  
Service Provider Relationships 
Underwriters are alert for high turnover rates in th e firm's associations with key outside service 
organizations. Changes in major (1) banking relationshi ps, (2) independent auditors, (3) law firms, (4) 
investment bankers, (5) pension fund/investment ma nagers, and (5) insurance brokers could indicate 
potential difficulties.  
Company Size 
As already mentioned in this section, claims agains t a firm's directors and officers are related to the 
organization's asset size. For this reason, prem ium for a D&O policy correlates closely with a 
company’s total assets. The larger the firm, the more vulnerable it is to suits, mainly as a result of 
wider public visibility, coupled with more diversified stock ownership. 
Company Age 
Underwriters generally prefer older, more estab lished organizations to relatively newer firms. 
Accordingly, it is more difficult to secure D&O c overage for companies that have been in business 
less than 5 years than for older, more established co mpanies. Start-ups and firms that have only been 
in business for brief periods of time pose added risks associated with so-called “growth companies” (e.g., suits arising out of IPOs) and also must buck the odds implicit in the high failure rate for all new Chapter 12—Underwriting Directors & O fficers Liability Insurance: Part 2 
83 businesses. Absent the longevity required to demonstrat e a track record of sustained profits, relatively 
new companies are less desirable D&O risks and their premium rates reflect this. 
Degree of Diversification 
Diversified conglomerates produce a higher incidence of claims than do companies with business 
activities confined to more limited sectors and produc t lines. Risks of financial loss tend to increase as 
firms begin to depart from their core businesses a nd diversify into unrelated endeavors where senior 
management has relatively little experience. Clearly , the organization's inclination to integrate 
vertically or horizontally appears to augment its ri sk of lawsuits against the firm's directors and 
officers. 
Degree of Centralization 
Highly centralized organizations pose reduced risks of D&O claims because they are easier to control 
and manage, compared to firms operating on a more  decentralized basis. Accordingly, companies 
with subsidiaries and divisions that function on a re latively autonomous basis, especially in financial 
matters (e.g., subsidiaries having sep arate banking, insurance, and outs ide auditing relationships), are 
carefully underwritten. Similarly, underwriters must closely examine firms with overly complex 
organizational structures, especially those operating in tax-haven jurisdictions for which there appears 
to be no clear business purpose. 
Public Perception 
Studies and surveys by major business publications have proven conclusively that the public holds 
certain firms in higher esteem than it does othe rs (e.g., Fortune magazine's annual survey of 
America's Most Admired Companies). Those held in lesser esteem are somewhat more vulnerable to D&O claims than companies that are highly regarded. 
Risk Management Program 
A firm's risk management program can often provid e valuable insight to a D&O underwriter. Adverse 
loss experience in major property and casualty lines might suggest management problems. Stability of relationships with insurers a nd brokers also offers clues about the organization. Finally, 
management's involvement with and support of pr operty and liability loss control programs often 
indicate its willingness to minimize D&O claim exposures. 
Loss History 
Underwriters also consider a company’s prior clai m record in evaluating a D&O risk. Most important 
is whether and to what extent an organization impl emented procedural changes to avoid future claims 
from a similar source.  
Certainly, the likelihood of future claim activity is  influenced by a firm’s previous loss experience. 
Nevertheless, that record must be analyzed in lig ht of changes within management and the board of 
directors. Negative loss experience is no longer meaningful if there has since been a complete 
turnover within these groups. 
   Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
84 Composition and Operation of the Board of Directors  
Although underwriters carefully evaluate financ ial, industry/competitive, and internal company 
factors, the essence of any D&O risk is the qualit y of the individuals who serve as directors and 
officers. According to Dan Bailey, a noted authority on D&O liability: 
[T]he single most important underwriting cons ideration is the quality of the people 
involved in the management of the corpora tion. Any future claim under the policy will 
relate to the alleged actions or omissions of these people. Therefore, the more 
experienced, capable, honest, knowledgeable and forthright is the management, the less 
risk of valid claims being asserted.  
Degree of Control by the Chairman  
Underwriters should be wary of bo ards on which a single individual, usually the chairman of the 
board, appears to exercise a disproportionate degree of control over the organization. Such control 
sometimes leads to a “groupthink” mentality in which other directors and officers merely rubber-
stamp the initiatives proposed by the chairman of the board, without carefully examining the details and assumptions underlying his or her ideas.(Gr oupthink has been defined as “a type of thought 
exhibited by group members who attempt to mitigate conflict and reach consensus without critically 
testing, analyzing or evaluating ideas.” 
Conversely, and although this is less often the case, problems can also arise when the board chairman 
is relatively weak. Board chairmen who are too eas ily influenced by others are sometimes coerced 
into making unwise decisions. Similarly, firms having chairmen with good ideas—but little 
influence—are also prone to ill-advised actions that sometimes produce claims. 
Board Selection Criteria and Composition 
In addition to evaluating the board chairman, underwriters must also assess the individuals 
comprising a company's board of directors. Although no clear criteria exist for being selected as a 
director, such persons should possess integrity, an inquiring mind, ample experience, good business 
judgment, and an understanding of business fundamentals (e.g., finance, law, marketing, accounting, 
investing). Perhaps most important is the fact that board members should not be selected purely on the basis of friendship or politics.  
Specific Selection Criteria 
There are three specific fa ctors underwriters consider in evaluating the individuals who make up a 
firm's board of directors: size of the board, diversity of experience, and independence.  
Size of the Board 
The typical board of directors of the average publicly-held corporation numbers around 12 persons. Yet, it is debatable whether this is really an op timal number. Often, detailed questioning and extended 
discussion is impossible in a group of this size, so that in some instances, a smaller number of persons, perhaps as few as 6, would function more effectively, while still offering a diversity of 
backgrounds and experience. Accordingly, a board size  of at least 6, but no more than 12, comprises 
the optimal range for a public company.  
  Chapter 12—Underwriting Directors & O fficers Liability Insurance: Part 2 
85 Diversity of Experience 
Directors should possess experience in areas not solely confined to the company's core business. For 
example, the outside directors of a bank should come from several different industry backgrounds, rather than being restricted to persons with  banking as their principal business experience.  
Independence 
Underwriters must carefully examine the relati onships between board members and the companies 
they have been asked to serve. Accordingly, some degree of detachment from the organization is desirable. Close connections sometimes produce conf licts of interest. Moreover, underwriters should 
question the boards of firms when all or most of the members are inside, rather than outside directors. 
Unless a firm has a number of board members who have no connection to the firm, the objectivity of 
the board's decision-making process is likely to be compromised.  
Compensation Method of Management 
The manner in which operating management is compensated should also be carefully considered by 
underwriters. Some industry observers go so far as to  assert that “outsized” executive compensation is 
the single most reliable risk marker, as it usually invites a host of dangerous (and sometimes destructive) behaviors. Certainly, many of the mo st egregious corporate scandals in the last several 
years have involved excessive executive compensation.  Accordingly, underwriters will consider the 
details surrounding executive compensation as an im portant component of the risk analysis.  
Analyze the Effect of “Non-Salary” Items 
Underwriters should be especially wary of firms in which compensation of management is heavily 
dependent on non-salary items such as bonuses, stoc k options, and similar incentives. One problem 
with these types of arrangements is that they of ten encourage excessive risk-taking, promote the 
implementation of overly aggressive accounting methods, or, in the worst-case scenario, provide 
incentive to commit fraud in boosting reported earnings. Another problem is that these non-salary 
items are also more easily hidden from public disclosure, yet another factor that creates incentive for excessive risk-taking.  
The Greatest Danger: When CEOs “Manage” Earnings  
Many observers agree that there is great danger i nherent in management compensation plans when a 
CEO’s compensation package is h eavily impacted by stock options. Under these conditions, CEOs 
have particular incentive to maximize the company’s stock price, which, in turn, encourages earnings 
manipulation. Accordingly, CEOs will be more likely to artificially increase earnings by means of questionable, if not fraudulent, accounting practices.  
This was the conclusion of a study by Lin Peng and Alisa Roell titled “Executive Pay and 
Shareholder Litigation” (December 2005), noting that “there is a significant relationship between 
option-based executive compensation and shareholder class litigation” and that “incentive pay in the 
form of options significantly increases the probability of a shareholder class action lawsuit. “ 
   Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
86 Earnings and Auditors 
Another related problem is the fact that there is an inherently “incestuous” relationship between 
companies and their supposedly independent a uditing firms. In the case of Enron (and other 
corporations, as well), Enron pressured its auditi ng firm, Arthur Andersen, to certify financial 
statements that Andersen knew were highly inaccurate, if not fraudulent. Andersen’s incentive to comply was that Enron also provided Andersen w ith highly lucrative consulting engagements which, 
in reality, were much more profitable for Andersen  than was the standard audit work. This allowed 
Enron to pressure Andersen into certifying Enron’ s blatantly misstated earnings. Ultimately, such 
deception helped to maintain a high share pri ce and increase the extent of earnings-driven 
compensation plans for top management.  
CEO Compensation Packages: What To Look For  
Given the frequency of compensation-related D&O claims, coupled with the correlation between 
options-driven compensation packages and securities litigation (as already noted in this Course), 
underwriters carefully scrutinize the details of the CEO's employment contract. Questions to be posed 
include the following.  
• Are the compensation levels realistic?  
• Are they in line with other CEOs in the same industry?  
• Does the nature of the compensation plan prov ide more incentive to manage the stock price 
than to manage the company itself? 
• Does the compensation packag e achieve the right mix of both short and long-term 
performance incentives? 
Analyzing Board Turnover 
Frequent turnover among a firm's officer/director group indicates the possible presence of inherent 
conflicts and problems that could only be resolved by resignations—voluntary or otherwise. When evaluating a prospective insured, underwriters s hould request additional information concerning the 
reasons for such turnover.  
Assessing the Board's Knowledge of the Organization 
It is important for an underwriter to assess the exte nt to which the directors are knowledgeable about 
the organization. Absent such knowledge, a director  will be unable to render sound advice when the 
organization is presented with various options or courses of action in specific situations. 
Preliminary study, prior to joining a board, should in clude reviews of the corporate charter or bylaws 
and recent board and committee meetings minutes. Additionally, a new director should be aware of the immediate political, legal, and competitive envi ronment in which the organization operates.  
A number of authorities recommend that new directors meet privately with the firm's independent auditors, as well as with its outside counsel. These m eetings can provide a somewhat less biased view 
of the organization than would be obtained from in side directors and will assist the new director in 
formulating a more objective opinion about the company. Not only must new directors receive a thorough orientation, but existing directors should also continually update their knowledge of the 
important areas that affect the company. Corpor ate governance experts also recommend that the 
board should communicate frequently with the company’s CFO, particularly if a director is on the audit committee.  Chapter 12—Underwriting Directors & O fficers Liability Insurance: Part 2 
87 Conducting Face-to-Face Meetings with Management 
In an effort to more carefully evaluate the all- important people factor, un derwriters should request 
face-to-face meetings with top management personnel.  Many of the questions raised in this discussion 
of D&O underwriting are more easily answered by  the impressions obtained from such meetings 
rather than simply relying on da ta submitted with an applicati on or acquired from online sources. 
Such meetings have become especially important  considering the current environment. Since 
restatements, as well as auditor complicity in fra ud have become commonplace, underwriter meetings 
with an insured's CFO can help an underwriter develop a “comfort level” with a prospective insured's 
financial data. Or, alternatively, these meetings may reveal problems, indicating that financial 
statements cannot be taken at face value and that pot ential claim issues lurk beneath an otherwise rosy 
picture presented by the insured. Whichever the case, face-to-face meetings can sometimes afford the underwriter the opportunity to obtain clarification and ask questions that may assist in developing a clearer picture of a given D&O risk.  
Conclusion: The Art of D&O Underwriting  
Underwriting D&O insurance is as much an art as a sc ience. There are innumerable different types of 
businesses, the details of which uniquely affect a D&O risk from an underwriting standpoint. In 
addition, it should be apparent that most of th e factors discussed above are not subject to exact 
quantification. Thus, successful underwriters u se their experience, judgment, and well-honed 
instincts—rather than a strict set of rules—to de termine the premium level a nd the scope of coverage 
they will offer, in response to a request for D&O insurance. 
Chapter 12 Review Questions  
1. National Acquirer Company’s market share is on the rise, since it has gradually been buying 
out its major competitors. D&O underwriters would probably consider National Acquirer a 
higher-than-average claim risk because: 
a. National Acquirer’s directors and officers might be more interested in preserving their 
own positions than protecting the company. 
b. National Acquirer’s shareholders might accu se directors and officers of paying too little 
to acquire another company. 
c. National Acquirer’s shareholders might accuse directors and officers of paying too much to acquire another company. 
d. Buying out smaller competitors is illegal.

88 2. Vista Corporation stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hank was Vista 
Corporation’s chairman of the board until his ouster a few years ago. He still owns 40 percent 
of Vista’s stock, a much larger share than any other individual or organization. Current 
directors and officers collectively own only 12  percent of Vista’s outstanding stock. In 
reviewing Vista’s D&O application, underwriters would most likely: 
a. Be leery because Hank is likely to bring a suit at the first sign of a business downturn. 
b. Exclude coverage for claims brought by shareholders other than Hank. 
c. Reduce the premium because concentration in  stock ownership tends to reduce claim 
frequency. 
d. View Vista favorably because closely-held public companies have a relatively low claim 
frequency. 
3. All else being equal, D&O underwriters  tend to prefer a firm that is: 
a. Relatively large but older and well-established. 
b. Relatively small but older and well-established. 
c. A relatively large start-up firm. 
d. A relatively small start-up firm. 
4. Because Frank Sonata, Chairman of the Blue Eyes Company board of directors, selected 
nearly all of the firm’s directors and officers,  he also believes he can terminate any board 
member who disagrees with him. Consequently, there is little disagreement among board 
members. Whenever a board decision produces favorable results, Frank loudly proclaims, 
“they did it my way!” Unfavorable results are not discussed. In evaluating these circumstances, a D&O underwriter would: 
a. Be wary because Frank appears to exerci se a disproportionate degree of control. 
b. Suspend judgment pending more detailed anal ysis of the results of Frank’s decisions. 
c. View Frank’s strong leadership favorably. 
d. View the board’s lack of dissent favorably , since dissent tends to generate claims. 
5. Jack and Jill have just been elected as new outside  directors of Well Company. In order to get 
a somewhat unbiased view of Well Company, it would be a good idea for Jack and Jill to: a. Hold one-on-one meetings with top corporate officers. 
b. Meet privately with the board chairman and inside counsel. 
c. Meet privately with the firm’s inde pendent auditors and outside counsel. 
d. Review the corporation’s annual report to stockholders, press releases, and other public 
documents.

1. c. Acquiring companies are always vulnerable to cr iticism that the purchase price paid for a company it 
acquired was excessive. 
2. a. One person or organization with a great deal at stake is a prime candi date for bringing suit at the first 
sign of a business downturn. 
3. b. The larger the firm, the more vulnerable it is to suits. Underwriters also prefer older, more-
established organizations over relatively new firms. 
4. a. Frank’s dominance likely creates a groupthink me ntality in which his proposals are not carefully 
examined by other board members. 
5. c. As outsiders who also deal with other organizations, these individuals are likely to have a broader, 
more objective perspective than corporate insiders.

    91 Chapter 13 
Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 1: General Suggestions  
Chapter 13 provides a number of general sugges tions on how to prevent D&O claims. Insured 
companies can implement these suggestions themselves and, in addition, underwriters can 
recommend that insureds apply such loss control practices. Chapter 14 offers various loss control 
techniques that apply to the area of corporate governance. 
Exhibit 13.1 lists these general techniques, which are discussed in the pages that follow. 
 
Exhibit 13.1 
D&O Loss Control Techniques  
• Encourage active questioning and appropriate dissent  
• Rely on legal counsel and outside experts where needed  
• Insist on a sufficient flow of in formation from operating managers  
• Avoid embarrassing corporate actions  
• Have directors/officers read the firm's D&O policy and application  
• Monitor insider trading  
• Investigate warning signs 
• Don’t manage to artificial indicators 
Encourage Active Questioning and Appropriate Dissent  
The chairman of the board should conduct meeti ngs in as unbiased a fashion as possible. The purpose 
of having a board is not necessarily to achieve unanimity of opinion but to  encourage discussion and 
the airing of alternative courses of action and view points. The board chairman must encourage dissent 
among board members and encourage board members to put forth out-of-the-ordinary viewpoints. By discouraging a “yes man” culture within corporate boardrooms, the kinds of wrongdoing witnessed at 
Countrywide, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and others w ould have been more difficult to carry out.  
The Problem with Board Appointments : Most Often a Function of Friendship 
Unfortunately, directorships are almost always give n to those who are close personal friends of the 
company’s chairman. As a result, board members’ general business philosophies tend to mesh closely Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
92 with the CEO. For this reason, there is an inhere nt tendency of board members to agree with the 
chairman, rather than questioning his/her ideas and initiatives. Clearly, since the typical member of a 
board of directors is chosen on the basis of friendship, rather than expertise, the airing of differing 
viewpoints tends to be the exception, rather than th e rule. So to the extent possible, boards should 
guard against the dangers inherent in “groupthink”  based upon personal affinity, relying instead upon 
true expertise and objectivity. 
Consult with Legal Counsel and Outside Experts  
In situations where actions must be taken (e.g., r esponding to a take-over bid), but where there is 
potential for claims arising from such actions, relia nce on outside investment banking and/or legal 
counsel is perhaps the best method of reduci ng exposure and developing a sound defense to 
allegations of wrongdoing.  
For example, if another firm makes an offer to buy the company, an independent investment banking 
firm can provide objective input as to its fair market value. Acceptance or rejection of the offer—based on an unbiased party's assessment—can then be used to justify management's final decision when confronted by a lawsuit alleging that direct ors and officers agreed to sell the company at too 
low a price; or, alternatively, that it mistakenly rejected a buy-out proposal because, in the board of 
directors’ view, the offering price was too low. 
Maintain Contact with Operating Managers  
Directors must guard against being insulated from the actions and decisions of operating managers. 
This is an admittedly difficult task given the dist ance between an outside director and the company's 
day-to-day operations. There should be no h esitation in questioning members of operating 
management about actions that have been taken, or regarding current conditions. While only directors 
have the legal right to attend board meetings, operating managers should be questioned at such meetings, where appropriate. 
“Management by Walking Around”  
In addition to their other oversight work, dir ectors should also thoroughly examine the company’s 
day-to-day, “ground level” operations. In effect, “management by walking around” is important for 
directors to do on a periodic basis. Board memb ers should be curious and should occasionally visit 
stores, factories, and other company offices. Even asking questions of regular employees and mid-level management is appropriate.  
Avoid Embarrassing Corporate Actions  
Management experts frequently advise businesses “n ever do anything in private that would be 
embarrassing if revealed to the public.” During the fall of 2008, it was revealed that AIG had spent nearly a half-million dollars to send a number of its sales executives to a junk et at a high-end resort. 
Normally, this would not have triggered a public  outcry. However, only a month earlier, AIG had 
received more than $100 billion in U.S. government funding, as a means of saving the company from bankruptcy. This was a classic example of how a seem ingly private action fanned the flames of public 
resentment—an action which encouraged investors to  file additional claims against the company’s 
directors and officers, in addition to the ones that ha d been already made at the time of the revelation 
about the junket.  Chapter 13—Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 1:  
General Suggestions 
93 Require Review of the D&O  Policy and Application  
By studying both the application for D&O coverage and the policy itself, directors and officers will 
have a better idea of the scope of acts covered by the insurance contract. Reviews of this kind can 
provide a heightened awareness of the types of cond uct that could give rise to claims—regardless of 
whether coverage applies. In addition, the orga nization's risk manager or insurance representative 
should be called upon annu ally to make a detailed presentation about the firm's D&O insurance 
program. This provides an ideal forum to address difficult points of coverage as well as to update 
directors and officers on the current state of the market for coverage. 
The Importance of the Application 
Special attention should be focused on two items wi thin the application. First, directors/officers 
should study the documents attached to the app lication. This is because inaccuracies or outright 
misrepresentations in such documents have increasingl y been used as the basis of rescission (i.e., an 
action that voids the entire policy) by insurers.  
Second, board members should review the claim wa rranty statement, in which the signer of the 
application is asked to assert that he/she knows of  no incidents that could produce a future claim. 
Discussions concerning this item could reveal probl ematic situations that should be immediately 
reported to the firm's current insurer, an action that might prevent a claim denial under a future 
policy. 
Monitor Insider Trading 
The most dangerous component of a serious securities class action lawsuit is the presence of 
significant insider trading at suspicious time and in suspicious amounts. For example, Enron Chief 
Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling sold massive am ounts of the company’s stock during the summer 
of 2001, immediately prior to the implosion of the company’s stock in the fall of that year. The same 
is true of former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozill o, who also unloaded suspicious amounts of the 
stock he owned in the company, immediatel y before it experienced a similar plunge. 
Given the high correlation between heavy insi der trading and securities class action claims, 
underwriters often insist that the company’s in sider trading policy has well-established trading 
“blackouts” (e.g., no trading is allowed for the 60 days immediately prior to or after a quarterly earnings announcement) and “windows” (e.g., trading is only allowed during the first 60 days of each fiscal year). Lastly, these policies should be overseen by an effective compliance officer who strictly enforces such rules.  
Investigate Warning Signs 
In most instances of corporate financial or operational problems, warning signs are visible to senior management and directors long before the problem fully develops. Directors and officers should be 
vigilant in identifying those warning signs and should adequately respond on a timely basis.  
For example, a number of claims involve (1) a company entering into numerous transactions designed 
for financial reporting purposes—rather than tho se containing real economic substance; (2) an 
excessive number of related-party transactions, such as large dollar volume sales to subsidiaries; and (3) highly complex transactions in which the structur e, purpose, terms, and effect of the transactions 
were not understood by some senior managers and the directors.  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures 
94 Enron: A Case Study in Financial Manipulation 
A high percentage of Enron’s revenues were ge nerated by “sales” of assets to non-consolidated 
“special purpose entities.” These kinds of complex, off-balance sheet transactions are completely 
lacking in economic substance, yet create the app earance of actual revenue. They are often a sign of 
intentional financial mismanagement and ultimat ely produce claims. Such activity requires thorough 
investigation. These and similar transactions s hould be approved by know ledgeable, informed, and 
truly independent boards of directors, based on the advice of qualified outside advisers where appropriate. 
Don't Manage to Artificial Indicators 
Public companies routinely focus on meeting an alysts' expectations of quarterly earnings. 
Regrettably, meeting these expectations can beco me an end in itself, rather than managing the 
company to achieve long-run growth and profitability.  As a result, an environment can be created in 
which personnel at all levels of the company are pr essured to do whatever it takes to meet these short-
term artificial indicators. Such a mindset unduly emphasizes short-term performance and may encourage the kinds of deceptive accounting prac tices described above. Instead, companies should 
strive to build long-term credibility and seek to avoid unreasonable expectations by company constituents such as stockholders and securities analysts.

 97 Chapter 14 
Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 2:  Effective Corporate Governance  
This chapter provides a detailed review of a comp any’s corporate governance practices, an important 
part of public company underwriting.  
What Is “Corporate Governance”? 
Corporate governance is a system specifying the division of duties, rights, and responsibilities among 
various participants in a corporation, typically the board of directors, the various committees within 
the board of directors, operating managers, and shareholders. Corporate governance enumerates the 
rules, guidelines, and procedures for making decisi ons affecting corporate affairs. The term has 
received particular attention in recent years because of massive lawsuits against the directors and 
officers of a number of high-profile corporations that filed for bankruptcy. Many business 
commentators, as well as insurance industry observers, believe that a breakdown of corporate 
governance, especially in the area of financial and accounting controls, was largely responsible for 
such failures. 
Although adoption of a “best practices” approach to corporate governance provides no guarantee that 
a company will not be involved in a claim, firms that are actively implementing such practices are 
less likely to have problems and will better able to defend themselves if a claim does arise. Exhibit 14.1 lists these “best practices,” whic h are discussed in this chapter. 
 
    
 
   Directors & Officers Liability Exposures  
98 Exhibit 14.1 
“Best Practices” Corporate Governance  
• Assure independent decision-making on the board  
• Require a minimum level of stock ownership 
• Reform option-related compensation practices 
• Separate the roles of chairman and CEO 
• Conduct CEO-free board meetings 
• Periodically evaluate director performance 
• Improve audit committee effectiveness  
• Provide directors with relevant and timely information 
• Limit time devoted to board service 
• Avoid conflicts of interest 
• Eliminate corporate board “interlock”   
Assure Independent Decision Making on the Board 
The following actions can assure the independence of a corporate board.  
Limit Corporate Boards to No More than Three Insiders 
If a board consists of only three insiders (typically  the CEO, COO, and CFO) there will be a higher 
probability of independent decision-making (assuming there are at least four outside directors). This 
is true because when operating executives are in the mi nority, they will, of course, have a minority of 
votes on any given issue or proposal. For example, if a board consists of ten members, only three of 
whom are insiders, the seven outside directors will constitute an automatic majority. 
Assign Only Independent, Outside Di rectors to the Three Key Committees 
The audit, compensation, and nominating comm ittees are the three key board committees. By 
assigning only independent directors to them, the board will be better able to render unbiased 
decisions. 
Set Mandatory Term Limits  
Directors should be required to resign after 10 years on the board or at age 70, whichever comes first. These benchmarks help to ensure that a board member  does not become so entrenched that he or she 
begins to rubber stamp a CEO’s initiatives, rather  than evaluating each major proposal with healthy 
skepticism. A number of corporate governance experts refer to planned, periodic turnover as 
maintaining a “refreshed board.”  
Ban (or at Least Limit) Stock Sales by Directors, for the Duration of Their 
Service  
If directors are banned from selling their shares during their tenure, they will have more incentive to 
reveal inappropriate conduct by  operating management. This will allow them to divulge such 
improprieties without fear of the consequences associated with short-term price declines in the 
company’s stock that may follow.  Chapter 14—Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 2:  
Effective Corporate Governance 
99 For example, if a director feels that a company is engaging in “aggressive accounting” in an effort to 
bump up earnings, an announcement to that effect would probably cause a drop in the company’s 
share price, at least in the short-term. However, if a rule were in effect that banned sales of the 
company’s stock during a director’s tenure, the share price would likely recover and the director would not be hurt financially. (Alternatively, lim iting such sales to perhaps $250,000 each year would 
have essentially the same effect, while allowing for the fact that directors may have personal emergencies requiring them to raise cash by selling stock in the company.) 
Require a Minimum Level of Stock Ownership 
On a number of high-profile corporate boards, directors hold only small equity positions. As a result, they are virtually immune to the financial consequences of their own poor decisions. However, by requiring a minimum $250,000 equity stake, there is  greater assurance that the interests of 
stockholders and board members will be aligned. The only exception to this rule should be for relatively new directors who have not served on the board long enough to build up an equity stake of $250,000. (This is, in essence, the converse of th e situation noted above, in which board members 
have too much of a stake in the company’s fortunes, in the short-term, at least.) 
Reform Option-Related Compensation Practices 
As already explained in this course, option grants are a significant source of claims against corporate 
directors and officers. So by bringing increased di scipline to the process of option grants, there will 
be reduced temptation for directors and officers to ar tificially inflate the prices of their stocks through 
short-term earnings maneuvers, in hope s of cashing in outsize option gains.  
Accounting Rules Incentivi ze Option Grant Abuses 
Under current accounting rules, stock option grants are not treated as an expense on a corporation’s 
income statement. This rule has the effect of  encouraging options grants as part of CEO pay 
packages, as well as director and officer pay packages. (Instead, if such grants were treated as current expenses, it would have the effect of lowering a co rporation’s short-term earnings, something that 
few corporations prefer.)  
The rule, in turn, supplies co rporate executives with incentive— perhaps too much incentive—to 
manipulate the price of the corporation's stock. Such incentive, as has been apparent in a number of 
high-profile corporate meltdowns and subsequent D&O litigation, ca n produce questionable, if not 
fraudulent, accounting practices.  
Another advantage of “expensing” options is that this practice will produce more accurate earnings in 
the short-run.  
Specific Option-Related “Best Practices” 
The following specific procedures that have been  suggested to change the system of option 
accounting and granting, include the following. 
• Barring exercise of options for a relatively long period, such as 3, 5, or even 7 years.  
• Prohibiting the exercise of options, unless the stock meets or exceeds some specific 
benchmark, such as equaling the annual return of the S&P 500 index.  
• Charging the cost of option grants against current income (noted above). Directors & Officers Liability Exposures  
100 • Awarding to executives stock that must be held for a number of years, so CEOs can “win big 
or lose big” along with stockholders.  
• Requiring shareholders—not simply the board  of directors—to vote on all stock option 
grants.  
Separate the Roles of Board Chairman and CEO 
Since the Enron bankruptcy in December 2001 and th e other high-profile corporate failures that have 
followed, one area of corporate governance that has received particular attention is the question of 
whether the roles of chairman of the board and chief executive officer should be split. Some argue 
that such an arrangement provides greater oversight of corporations and, in extreme cases, serves to 
rein in CEOs tempted to bend the rules or even break the law.  
Split of Board Chairman and CEO Roles Common in Canada and the U.K. 
Although approximately 80 percent of all American CEOs also serve as board chairmen, the situation 
is the reverse in Canada and England, where only 20 percent of all CEOs also hold the position of 
board chairman. A switch to this system woul d represent a sea change in American corporate 
governance. Nevertheless, given current investor skepticism and heightened demands for added scrutiny of corporate actions, an argument could be  made for improved corporate governance if CEOs 
were to relinquish their title of “board chairman.” In the wake of recent events, a splitting of the CEO 
and board chairman's roles might also assure D& O underwriters that fina ncial restatements and 
similar liability-producing events ar e more likely to be prevented. 
Better Monitoring of CEO Performance 
Another argument in favor of dividing these roles is  that there is an inherent conflict when a board 
must monitor a CEO's performance and hold him accountable for results—if the CEO is also 
chairman of the board. Indeed, the theoretical roles of chairman of the board and the CEO call for two 
separate individuals to handle each of the two distinct roles required by these positions. More 
specifically, the CEO is charged with creating overall strategies and running the company, whereas the chairman of the board is chiefly responsible for leading the board in overseeing the company’s top 
management. When the chairman of the board and the CEO are the same person, the board’s 
oversight role is compromised. Accordingly, a numb er of experts believe that effective governance is 
impossible if the same person is responsible for developing the firm’s overall strategy and managing 
the business on a day-to-day basis, yet also charge d with evaluating and at times, challenging those 
strategies on behalf of the company’s owners. In their view, unless these two roles are separated, corporate governance will be an illusion.  
Board Chairman and CEO: Too Demanding for One Person? 
A number of observers feel it has become nearly impossible to effectively run a major corporate 
entity, while at the same time performing all of th e duties of a board chairm an. Since the chairman’s 
role includes setting the board agenda, providing the board members with the highest-quality 
information, and facilitating communication among bo ard members and with management, it is often 
believed that all of these duties, in addition to runn ing a major corporation, are simply too much for 
one person. 
 Chapter 14—Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 2:  
Effective Corporate Governance 
101 Appoint an Independent Lead Director: An Alternative To Splitting the Roles 
Another variation on the approach of splitting the jobs of board chairman and CEO is to have an 
independent “lead” director who, after each boa rd meeting, meets with the other independent 
directors. This approach provides greater oversight of the CEO and of the entire board, yet is 
admittedly not as effective as having separate individuals serving in these two positions. 
Conduct “CEO-Free” Board Meetings 
Fewer than half of all corporate boards hold mee tings without the CEO being present. However, 908 
directors of Fortune 1000 companies were in favor of holding CEO-free meetings, according to a 
survey conducted by Korn/Ferry In ternational. Yet since a majority of public corporations do not 
conduct board meetings without the presence of the CEO, this apparent “disconnect” between survey results and actual practice, indicates that either di rectors are not insisting on such meetings or CEOs 
are not allowing them. 
Facilitating Frank Discussions 
The value of CEO-free board meetings is that they  allow board members, who will not often confront 
hard issues with the CEO in the room, to be mo re open in his or her absence. Clearly, “executive 
sessions,” as CEO-free board meetings are sometimes called, can promote the kind of candid, open discussions that may not otherwise have been possible.  
Periodically Evaluate Director Performance  
The board of directors should periodically evaluate director and officer performance and assess the extent to which these persons have me t the standards set forth for them.  
Areas To Evaluate 
Among the most important areas in which performance should be evaluated, include:  
• regularity of attendance at both board and committee meetings,  
• general level of preparedness,  
• capacity for asking challenging questions,  
• ability to offer creative suggestions, and  
• willingness to make and take constructive criticism.  
Peer performance reviews of this type are essential in assuring that those serving in director and 
officer capacities are putting forth their best efforts.  Although feelings will sometimes be hurt by this 
process, the stakes are too high for an organization not to receive anything less than top performance 
from its directors and officers. 
  
 
  Directors & Officers Liability Exposures  
102 Improve Audit Committee Effectiveness 
The audit committee is perhaps the most important committee of the board of directors. Among its 
most important duties, include monitoring and oversight of the following. 
1. Financial reporting and disclosure 
2. The choice of accounting policies and principles 
3. Hiring and performance evaluation of external auditors 
4. Regulatory compliance, ethics, and whistleblower hotlines 
5. The internal control process 
6. The internal audit function 
7. Risk management policies and practices.  
Suggestions to enhance the committee's effectiveness include the following.  
• Financial Literacy.  Audit committees should be composed of at least financially literate 
members (and preferably those with financ ial expertise) who can fully understand and 
critique the company's financial statements. In  particular, the chairperson of the audit 
committee should be well steeped in financia l and accounting knowledge and experience.  
• Independence.  Audit committee members should be truly independent from management 
and the auditors. Business, social, or other relationships that may impede the independent 
thinking and decision making of committee memb ers should be considered when evaluating a 
member's qualifications for service on the audit committee.  
• Frequent Meetings.  Audit committees should meet regularly and frequently (i.e., each 
month), not just in connection with the annual audit.  
• Auditor Selection.  The audit committee—not the CFO—should have full responsibility for 
selecting, hiring, and terminating outside auditors . A periodic turnover of auditors (or at least 
the partner in charge of the audit) is advisable.  
• Discussions with Auditors.  The audit committee should discuss annual financial statements 
in one-on-one meetings with the company's aud itors, senior management (e.g., the CFO), and 
internal accountants. In particular, the CFO should spend time with board members on the 
audit committee to verify that they are well- versed on the unique financial aspects of the 
business.  
• Financial Reporting Policies. The audit committee should examine very closely the 
financial reporting and accounting policies for si gnificant transactions that can materially 
affect the company's earnings performance for a quarter or year. The audit committee should 
also verify that generally Accepted Accoun ting Principles (GAAP) have been followed.  
 
    Chapter 14—Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 2:  
Effective Corporate Governance 
103 • Separate Auditing and Consulting Services.  In recent years, virtually all of the major 
accounting firms have begun offering non-accounting/consulting services, from which these 
firms derive substantial fee income; often far exceeding audit-based revenues. A number of 
observers feel that the combination of both an audit and a consulting relationship with the 
same client severely compromises an accounting firm’s objectivity in performing the annual 
audit. Therefore, the only meaningful business relationship with a company’s outside auditor 
should involve its annual audit. (Note: follo wing the Enron fiasco, Andersen’s consulting 
division split off to form a new, separate comp any: Accenture. This was partly in recognition 
of the conflicts that arise when auditing firm s also perform consulting work for the same 
company.) 
• Response to Complaints. The audit committee should establish procedures to receive, 
investigate, and respond to complaints or requests for confidential information from 
employees or others relating to the comp any's accounting or financial controls. 
Provide Directors with Relevant and Timely Information 
To facilitate their work, directors need to be give n information that is both relevant and timely. One 
of the most frequent complaints of directors is the increasing volume of reports being sent to them just prior to each meeting. Clearly, more is not better. An independent director who receives a 500-
page file 3 days before the board meeting and who is to attend a discussion that management has 
structured around completely abstruse technical point s, is of no use in the decision-making process. 
Instead, companies should strive to supply their boards with information packets that are truly 
pertinent to the issues on the upcoming agenda and manageable from the standpoint of length. 
Moreover, this information should be made availabl e well in advance (e.g., at least 2 weeks) of each 
board meeting. 
Create an Adequate Support Structure 
One way to assure the relevance and timeliness of information they receive, is to provide directors with an adequate support structure. Despite the increasing demands placed on them, even directors of 
large, public corporations do not always have a dedicated staff available to assist them. And yet, given their significant and growing responsibilities (especially since passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act), a support structure can be valuable in assu ring that directors have the necessary resources 
available to them.  
Limit Time Devoted to Board Service  
It has been estimated that approximately 200 hours per year are required to serve as a director of a major corporation. Accordingly, the National Asso ciation of Corporate Directors has stated that 
people should not sit on more than four boards at the same time. Undoubtedly, staying abreast of the complete scope of a firm's activities is an extr emely difficult task in any large organization. 
Therefore, underwriters should be alert for situati ons in which any member of a board of directors 
also sits on the boards of several other sizeable organi zations or serve as officers of such firms. Often, 
the demands that have been placed on a director from such activities make it difficult if not impossible to devote adequate time to preparing for board and committee meetings. An assertion that 
a board member had inadequate time to stay fully appr ised of relevant corporate matters is not a valid 
defense to claims against directors and officers. Directors & Officers Liability Exposures  
104 Semi-Retired Directors versus Directors with Full-Time Jobs 
It is also important to distinguish board members who have full-time jobs with other corporations 
from those that are “semi-retired.” For example, Avon states that if a board member is a full-time 
employee of another company, he or she can only sit on no more than two additional boards besides 
Avon. If not employed full-time, he or she can sit on no more than four additional boards.  
Limiting Board Service Is a Growing Trend 
According to the results of a 2006 survey by th e executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles, in 
conjunction with USC's Marshall School of Business, 40 percent of the corporations surveyed have 
mandated limits on the number of other boards on which outside directors can serve. This is up 
dramatically from 2001, a year in which just 3 pe rcent of the corporations surveyed imposed such 
restrictions. 
Avoid Conflicts of Interest  
According to Roswell B. Perkins, a prominent Ne w York attorney, the most effective test of a 
potential conflict of interest is for a board member to ask, “Do I have any reason to prefer corporate 
action A to action B, or vice versa, which is not a reason shared by all stockholders?” An affirmative 
answer reveals a conflict of interest.  
Conflicts of Interest: An Example 
John Smith, a director of the ABC property and casua lty insurance company is  also the CEO of XYZ, 
a leading independent claims adjusting firm. At a recent board meeting, ABC is discussing the need 
to hire an independent adjusting firm. A deluge  of claims, caused by a recent hurricane in South 
Florida (where ABC writes most of its business), has created this situation. Given these circumstances, Smith has a clear conflict of inter est. Although hiring his firm, XYZ, would obviously 
benefit Smith, the firm may not necessarily be the one best suited to ABC’s needs. Consequently, 
Smith can and should avoid this conflict of inter est by first, not being present during any of the 
board‘s discussions pertaining to the hiring of an adjusting firm. Second, he should recuse himself 
from voting, after the discussions have concluded and a single firm must be chosen. 
“Side Deals”: A Frequent Source of Conflicts  
So-called “side deals,” in which directors are freque ntly involved, are another source of conflicts of 
interest. According to Executive Compensation Adviso ry Services, one out of four U.S. firms is 
involved in such conflicts, the likes of which frequently include the following by board members, in 
conjunction with the compani es on whose boards they sit. 
• Receipt of consulting or legal fees  
• Participation in lease agreements  
• Involvement in contracts to purchase or supply goods  
Obviously, such deals cast serious doubt on a director's independence. In addition, these types of arrangements reflect poorly on the company's CEO because they create the perception that such 
consulting contracts are a means of quelling opposition on the board. Obviously, board members should not also function as consultants, suppliers, or providers of legal, brokerage, or investment banking services.  Chapter 14—Controlling Directors & Officers Liability Claims Part 2:

105 Eliminate Corporate Board “Interlock” 
Related to the issue of conflicts of interest is th e fact that there is a high percentage of “overlap” 
between the board members of many major corporations. Such overlap, also known as “interlock” 
occurs when two (or more) board members also who sit together on another corporate board.  
Board Interlock: Potential for Quid Pro Quo Deals 
The problem with board interlock is the potential for quid pro quo deals, especially when CEOs serve on each other's boards. According to NYU professor Lawrence White “Anytime you have two guys 
sitting on at least two boards, there's room for horse trading.” While corporate interlock does not 
necessarily create conflicts of interest, it does incr ease the potential for the kinds of acts that could 
encourage claims against directors and officers.  
Proving direct damage to shareholders from board interlock is difficult. Yet, if a board member 
rubber stamps a business decision that turns out to be a bad move and costs the company money, the 
question arises as to whether the directors made a mistake or whether they had ulterior motives.  
The Dangers of Board Interlock: An Example 
John Smith, who is the CEO of the Ajax Corporation sits on both the board and compensation 
committee of the National Motors Corporation. Mary Jones, National Motors’ CEO sits on both 
Ajax’s board and compensation committee. In this s ituation, it is quite obvious that each can assist the 
other in garnering maximum pay packages as CEO’s of their respective organizations.  
Exhibit 14.2 provides a case study of how the structur e of one board of directors, appeared to be 
burdened with (1) conflicts of interest, (2) board interlock, and (3) excessive time commitment to 
other boards.  
Exhibit 14.2 
American Airlines: A Case Study in Board Interlock  
May 9–15, 2003, the Dallas Business Journal  reported that Anne McNamara, who retired in 
January as general counsel for American Airlin es (AMR), is married to board member Philip 
Purcell, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley. As indicated in AMR's 2002 proxy statement, 
Morgan Stanley supplied financial services to AMR. According to Gavin Anderson of New 
York-based Governance Metrics International , Inc., “We wouldn't regard Mr. Purcell as 
independent.”  
Another potential problem is that eight AMR dire ctors sit on four or more boards. This exceeds 
the rule of thumb that a person who is employed on a full-time basis should sit on only one 
other board, while those not employed should serve on a maximum of four boards. (One member, Michael Miles, serves on seven boards in addition to AMR.)  
A third potential problem is the degree of interl ock between board members. Specifically, Miles 
and ex-AMR CEO Don Carty sit on Sears Roeb uck's board; Miles, Purcell, and Edward 
Brennan work together on Morgan Stanley's; Miles and Carty are on Dell Computer's; Brennan 
and Miles are part of Allstate Insurance Company’s; and Earl Graves and Judith Rodin serve 
on Aetna Insurance Company’s board.
