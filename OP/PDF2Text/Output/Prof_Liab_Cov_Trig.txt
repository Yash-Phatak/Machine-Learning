1 Chapter 1 
Introduction and Overview 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This Web CE course is designed to give a moderately experienced insurance person a detailed look at 
how both claims-made and occurrence coverage triggers function and are used in professional and 
executive liability insurance policies. It begins by  defining the term “coverage trigger,” introduces 
both claims-made and occurrence coverage triggers , and provides an example of how claims-made 
coverage triggers apply in a claim situation. Ne xt, the course distinguishes between the two different 
kinds of claims-made policies: those written with pure claims-made coverage triggers and those 
containing claims-made and reported coverage trigge rs. It introduces the concept of the retroactive 
date, commonly included within claims-made po licies. The course discusses discovery provisions and 
also addresses the two factors that complicate the a pplication of claims-made coverage triggers. Next, 
the problem of coverage gaps in claims-made polic ies, and how to close them by means of extended 
reporting periods and prior acts c overage, is reviewed. The course discusses the rationale for using 
claims-made coverage triggers as well as the a dvantages and disadvantages they present for both 
insureds and insurers. Since a handful of prof essional liability coverage lines are sometimes written 
on an occurrence basis, these coverage triggers—a nd how they differ from claims-made policies—are 
also explained. 
Following is a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of the course. 
• Chapter 2 defines the term “coverage trigger.” It provides brief introductions to the two types 
of coverage triggers—claims- made and occurrence—and concludes with an example of how 
claims-made coverage triggers apply in a claim situation.  
• Chapter 3 distinguishes between the two differe nt kinds of claims-made policies: those 
written with pure claims-made coverage tri ggers and those containing claims-made and 
reported coverage triggers. It  also introduces the concept of “first made” language and 
explains why this is important in claims-made policies. 
• Chapter 4 introduces the concept of the “retroactive date” found within claims-made policies. 
It begins by defining the term, discusses the pur pose of retroactive dates, and illustrates the 
uses of retroactive dates.  
• Chapter 5 provides additional of examples of how  claims-made coverage triggers apply in 
claims situations. It also introduces the concept of discovery provisions and explains how they can be used to lock-in cove rage, even before a claim is actu ally made against an insured.  
• Chapter 6 introduces the two factors that complicate the application of claims-made coverage triggers: the questions of “when” a wrongful act takes place and when a claim is “made.”  Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
2 • Chapter 7 discusses the three causes of coverage gaps in claims-made policies: retroactive 
date advancement, (2) cancellation or nonrenewal  by insurer or insured, and (3) replacement 
of a claims-made policy with an occurrence policy.  
• Chapter 8 explains how to close the three typ es of coverage gaps—discussed in the preceding 
chapter—that are sometimes created within claims-made covera ge triggers. The two methods 
of closing these gaps are (1) purchasing an extended reporting period (ERP) endorsement or (2) obtaining prior acts coverage in a replacement policy. 
• Chapter 9 describes the two rationales for why professional liability policies are written with claims-made coverage triggers: (1) they make it easier for underwriters to determine the 
extent of their ultimate liability on a book of business, relatively soon after policies have expired; and (2) they make it easier for one insure r, often in a series of different insurers, to 
determine which insurer is actually responsible for paying a given claim.  
• Chapter 10 analyzes the advantages and disadvant ages of claims-made policy forms, from the 
perspectives of both the insurer and the insured. 
• Chapter 11 defines the term “occurrence cove rage trigger,” explains how occurrence 
coverage triggers function in claim s ituations, and discusses the advantages and 
disadvantages they present for both insureds and insurers. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Define the term “coverage trigger” and give an example of how one applies to a situation 
involving multiple policy periods. 
2. Identify the two types of coverage triggers and distinguish between the two. 
3. Differentiate between the two major types of claims-made coverage triggers: “pure” claims-
made and claims-made and reported.  
4. Explain the key terms associated with claims-mad e coverage triggers, including: claims “first 
made” language, post-policy reporting periods, and retroactive dates. 
5. Enumerate and describe the three conditions required to trigger coverage under a claims-
made and reported policy that contains a retroactive date. 
6. Show how claims-made coverage trigge rs apply in actual claim situations. 
7. Provide examples of how discovery provisions can be used to lock-in coverage even before a 
claim is reported. 
8. Describe how the questions of (1) when a wr ongful act takes place and (2) when a claim is 
made complicate the application of claims-made coverage triggers. 
9. List and analyze the three causes of  gaps in claims-made policies. 
10. Demonstrate how extended reporting periods and arranging coverage on a prior acts basis can be used to close these gaps.  
11. Discuss the various elements contained within extended reporting period (ERP) provisions 
and show why these elements are important in determining coverage in a claim situation. 
12. State and explain the two major rationales for in surers’ use of claims-made coverage triggers. Chapter 1—Introduction and Overview 
3 13. Analyze the major advantages and disadvantages of claims-made coverage triggers from the 
perspective of both the insurer and the insured. 
14. Explain how occurrence coverage triggers func tion, illustrate their application in a claim 
situation, and discuss the advantages and disa dvantages they offer for both insureds and 
insurers.

Coverage Triggers: What Are They and How Do They Apply? 
This chapter begins by defining th e term “coverage trigger.” It also provides brief introductions to the 
two types of coverage triggers: claims-made and occurrence. The ch apter concludes by providing an 
example of how a claims-made coverage trigger applies in a claim situation.  
What is a “Coverage Trigger?”  
A liability insurance policy’s coverage trigger is the provision defining the nature and sequence of 
events that must take place for the policy to cove r a claim against an insured. The coverage trigger 
determines which policy—often in a series of policies spanning a number of years—will respond to a 
particular liability claim. 
Claims-Made Coverage Triggers: a Thumbnail Sketch 
The vast majority of professional and executive liability insurance policies contain claims-made 
coverage triggers. A claims-made coverage tri gger in a professional or executive liability policy 
obligates an insurer to defend and/or pay a claim that  is made against the insured during that policy. 
The terms and conditions of the policy that were in effect at the time the claim was made, are the ones 
that apply. This is illustrated in Exhibit 2.1.  
EXHIBIT 2.1 
HOW A CLAIMS-MADE COVERAGE TRIGGER APPLIES  
 
  
Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
6 In Exhibit 2.1, coverage under both policies is written on a claims-made basis. Coverage applies 
under Policy Term #2 because the making of the claim against the insured is the event that triggers 
coverage. Coverage does not a pply during Policy Term #1 because the commission of the wrongful 
act did not trigger coverage under a claims-made policy; no claim was actually made during Policy 
Term #1.  
Occurrence Coverage Triggers: a Thumbnail Sketch  
Although the vast majority of professional/executiv e liability policies are written with a claims-made 
coverage trigger, a handful of such policies contain an occurrence coverage trigger. More specifically, 
occurrence triggers are occasionally included in  professional liability policies written for media 
liability, police liability, medical malpractice, a nd hospital professional liability. Occurrence policies 
will be discussed in more detail in this course, beginning in Chapter 9. But for now, a brief 
explanation is necessary because before that chap ter, this course will also refer to occurrence 
coverage triggers.  
An occurrence coverage trigger in a professional lia bility policy obligates an insurer to defend and/or 
pay a claim if the claim arises from a wrongful act that was committed during the period in which the 
policy was effective. The terms and conditions of the policy that were in effect at the time the 
wrongful act took place are the ones that apply. This is in contrast to claims-made coverage, in which 
the terms and conditions of the policy in force at th e time the claim is made—are the ones that apply. 
Exhibit 2.2 illustrates an occurrence coverage trigger.  
EXHIBIT 2.2 
HOW AN OCCURRENCE COVERAGE TRIGGER APPLIES  
 In Exhibit 2.2, coverage under both policies is wr itten on an occurrence basis. Coverage applies under 
Policy Term #1 because the commission of the wrongfu l act is the event that triggers coverage. 
Coverage does not apply during Policy Term #2 because the making of the claim does not trigger 
coverage under an occurrence policy. 
How Claims-Made Coverage Triggers Operate: A Claim Scenario  
The following example illustrates how a claims-made coverage trigger applies under a professional 
liability policy.  
   
Chapter 2—Coverage Triggers: What Are They and How Do They Apply? 
7 Consider a situation in which a physician negligen tly performs surgery on a patient in year 1. An 
infection resulting from that surgery begins to de velop in year 2. The patient experiences illness in 
year 3 and as a result, threatens to sue the doctor. In  year 4, the doctor is served with a lawsuit (which 
he tenders to his insurer). In years 5, 6, and 7,  the physician’s insurer negotiates settlement of the 
claim with the patient’s attorney. In year 8, the insurance company settles the claim with the patient’s 
attorney. These events are summarized below. 
Year(s)  Event(s) 
1  Surgery performed 
2  Infection develops 
3  Illness develops, lawsuit threatened 4  Doctor served with lawsuit 
5, 6, 7  Settlement negotiations 
8  Claim settled 
 
Assuming the doctor’s professional liability insurance policy during this 8-year period was written 
with annual policy terms, he could conceivably have been protected by eight different insurance 
companies between the date of the medical error givi ng rise to the claim (year 1 in this example) and 
the date on which the claim was settled (year 8). The coverage trigger provisions included in the 
doctor’s professional liability insurance policies in  force during this period will determine which 
policy (or combination of policies) must respond to the claim.  
Potential Complications 
If the doctor had been covered by claims-made polici es during this period, the policy in year 4 would 
likely be the one to pay. In contrast, if a seri es of occurrence policies had been in place throughout 
this 8-year period, it would be very debatable as to which policy (year 1, year 2, year 3) might pay. 
Indeed, this scenario presents a prime example of why claims-made coverage triggers are normally 
used in professional liability policies. 
Chapter 2 Review Questions  
1. Because Loon Company’s D&O policy contains a claims-made coverage trigger, its insurer is obligated to defend and/or pay for : 
a. accidents that happen during the policy period. 
b. claims made against the insured during the policy period. 
c. events involving the insured during the policy period. 
d. occurrences that happen during the policy period. 
 
 Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
8 2. Egret Co has had three D&O policies with occurrence  triggers covering these dates: Policy 
A—June 1, 2010–June 1, 2011; Policy B—June 1, 2011–June 1, 2012; Policy C—June 1, 
2012–June 1, 2013. On September 11, 2012, a cl aim was made against Egret alleging that a 
wrongful act occurred on September 11, 2010. Coverage for this claim does not apply under 
Policy C, because: 
a. the insurer’s ability to defend the cl aim was prejudiced by the delay. 
b. Policy B is primary.  
c. Policy C’s other insurance provision precludes duplicate coverage. 
d. making a claim does not trigger coverage under an occurrence policy. 
     
 
    
 
     
 
    
Answers to Chapter 2 Review Questions 
1. b. A claims-made trigger obligates an insurer to de fend and/or pay a claim that is made against the 
insured during that policy. 
2. d. The making of the claim does not trigger coverage under an occurrence policy.   
9 Chapter 3 
The Two Types of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
There are two different kinds of claims-made polic ies: those written with pure claims-made coverage 
triggers and those containing claims-made and reported coverage triggers . Chapter 3 defines and 
differentiates between the two. It also introduces th e concept of “first made” language and explains 
why this is important in claims-made policies. 
“Pure” Claims-Made Policies 
With a pure claims-made policy, a claim must be firs t made against an insured during the term of the 
policy for coverage to be triggered under the po licy. However, “pure” claims-made policies do not 
impose a specific time period during which the claim must be reported to the insurer. Instead, they 
specify only that the claims must be reported “as soon as possible” or “as soon as practical.”  
When claims-made policies were originally intro duced, nearly all were written on a “pure” claims-
made basis. But in recent years (for reasons explained below), pure claims-made policies have 
become much less common. Currently, the vast majority of professional/executive liability insurance 
policies are written with claims-made and reported coverage triggers. 
Claims-Made and Reported Policies 
A claims-made and reported policy imposes two requirements before coverage is triggered. First, like the pure claims-made policy, the claim must be first made against the insured during the policy 
period. Second—and unlike pure claims-made policie s—the claim must also be reported to the 
insurer during a specific reporting period.  
Why Claims-Made and Reporte d Policies were Developed 
Claims-made and reported policies were introduced  because “pure” claims-made policies created two 
problems for insurers: problems in defending claims and difficulties in estimating claim liabilities.  
Defense Problems 
First, insurers found it difficult to defend claims that were reported many months, and in some cases 
many years, after they were made against an insu red. This is because the investigation process was 
hampered by these reporting delays. Specifically, given the passage of time, both witnesses and other forms of physical evidence become less available,  making it much harder for the insurer to defend 
claims.  Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
10 Claim Projection Problems 
Second, late reports of claims made it more difficult for underwriters to project ultimate claim 
liabilities, which defeated the purpose of the claims-m ade coverage trigger and, in effect, transformed 
the policies into occurrence forms. (This problem al so makes it more difficult for actuaries to develop 
appropriate rates for the product.) For example,  consider a book of professional liability business 
consisting of 1,000 policies, each policy written with  a 1/1/10–11 term. Also assume that 25 claims 
are made against the insureds under these policies dur ing this policy period, but that all 25 claims are 
not reported to the insurer until 1/1/13—i.e., 2 years after policy expiration. In this situation, an insurer cannot make an accurate est imate of its ultimate claim liabili ties for this book of business until 
2 full years after the policies had expired. For th is reason, observers have commented that a pure 
claims-made policy was more like an occurrence policy, in which covera ge is triggered by virtue of 
the wrongful act that produces a claim, irrespective of  when the claim is made against the insured or 
reported to the insurer. 
Reporting Requirements in Claims-Made Policies 
To alleviate these two problems (i.e., difficulties in defending claims and problems in projecting 
ultimate claim liabilities), insurers began to modify  their policy forms so that reporting requirements 
were included within the pure claims-made forms described above. Such requirements mandated that 
insureds report claims made against it to  the insurer, during the policy period. 
Drawbacks of Reporting Requirements 
Unfortunately it is sometimes impossible for an insured to comply with a reporting requirement 
specifying that the insurer be notified of claims made against the insured during the policy period. 
There are two sets of circumstances under which this problem commonly arises. 
• Claim Made Late in Policy Period . First, compliance is often impossible when claims are 
made against an insured very late in a policy period. For instance, assume that an insured physician has a professional liability policy writte n with a January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2011 
term. On December 31, 2010, a summons is delivered to the physician’s office. However, the day before, the physician left town to go on v acation. By the time he returns on January 6, 
2011 and receives the summons, it will be impossible for him to comply with his policy’s 
reporting requirement. 
• Claim Filed but Not Yet Served . Second, similar difficulties result when a lawsuit has been 
filed against an insured—during the policy te rm—but the insured is not served with a 
summons until after the policy has expired. Thus, the insured is unaware of the lawsuit until 
served with the summons. (In some instances, weeks or even months can elapse between the 
filing of a lawsuit and actual personal service.) 
Post-Policy Reporting Windows 
In both instances noted above, a reporting requirement, coinciding with the policy’s termination date, 
has the potential for unjust consequences. Therefore, it is always in an insured’s best interest if the 
reporting requirement included in a claims-made an d reported policy provision contains what is 
known as a 30-day or, preferably, a 60-day “reporting window.” This provision allows the insured to 
report claims made against the insured during the polic y period, to the insurer, for 30 or 60 days after 
that policy has expired. Exhibit 3.1 illustrates th e operation and importance of a post-policy reporting 
window. Chapter 3—The Two Types of Cl aims-Made Coverage Triggers 
11 EXHIBIT 3.1 
THE IMPORTANCE OF POST-POLICY REPORTING WINDOWS  
 
This scenario illustrates the importance of pos t-policy reporting windows. Unless the insured’s 
claims-made and reported policy contained either a 30- or 60-day reporting window, there would be 
no coverage for the claim. Although the claim was made against the insured during the policy period, 
it was not reported to the insurer until 30 days af ter the policy expired. So absent a 30- or 60-day 
reporting window, there would be no coverage for the claim. 
Claims “First Made” Language 
Coverage applies under claims-made policies only if a claim is first made against the insured during the policy period. The phrase “first made” is meaningful because coverage does not apply if the claim was previously made against the insured during a prior policy period—regardless of whether or not 
such policy was written by the current insurer or by a different insurer.  
“First Made” Language: Two Key Implications 
“First made” wording has two key implications: (1) it precludes coverage for claims that should 
rightfully be the responsibility of a previous insurer, and (2) it prevents the insured from obtaining coverage under a subsequent policy written by the cu rrent insurer that may be more favorable to his 
or her interests. For example, if an insured ma kes a claim under an insure r’s January 1, 2010-11

2011-2012 renewal policy that contains a $2 million li mit. . Given these reasons, virtually all claims-

Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
12 Chapter 3 Review Questions  
1. Because Dr. Swan has a pure claims-made policy, his coverage is triggered when a claim is : 
a. based on an occurrence during the term of his policy and reported to the insurer as soon 
as possible. 
b. both made against Dr. Swan and reported to the insurer during the term of his policy. 
c. made against Dr. Swan during the term of his policy and reported to the insurer as soon 
as practical. 
d. reported to the insurer during the term of his policy. 
2. On June 30, 2001 a claim against her arrived in her law office’s mail, but Jill Eagle did not personally receive it until she returned to work  on July 5, 2001 after an extended holiday 
weekend. Upon finding the claim,  Jill immediately called her in surance company to report it. 
Jill Eagle’s professional liability policy has e ffective dates from 7/1/00 to 7/1/01 and a 
claims-made and reported trigger that did not contain a post-policy reporting window. Based 
on this information, one must conclude that Jill has: 
a. coverage for this claim because Jill’s o ffice received it during the policy period. 
b. coverage for this claim because Jill reported it as soon as practical.  
c. coverage for this claim because it was made during the policy period. 
d. no coverage for this claim because it was reported after the policy period. 
3. Jay Blue has had three professional liability polic ies with claims-made triggers covering these 
dates: Policy A—June 1, 2010–June 1, 2011; Policy B—June 1, 2011–June 1, 2012; and 
Policy C—June 1, 2012–June 1, 2013. Policy C also has a 60-day post-policy reporting 
window. On May 30, 2013, a claim was made against Blue alleging that a covered type of 
error or omission occurred on September 11, 2010 . Blue reported the claim to his insurer on 
June 15, 2013. Based on this information, it is most likely that: 
a. coverage applies under Policy A. 
b. coverage applies under Policy B.  
c. coverage applies under Policy C. 
d. no coverage applies. 
  
Answers to Chapter 3 Review Questions 
1. c. A claim must be first made against an insured du ring the term of the policy and the claim must be 
reported “as soon as possible” or “as soon as practical. 
2. d. Jill did not comply with policy requirements—which were essentially impossible to comply with. 
She did not (and could not) report it during the policy period. 
3. c. The claim was made during Policy C’s term  and reported during the reporting window.   
13 Chapter 4 
Retroactive Dates in Claims-Made Policies 
Chapter 4 introduces another important element of claims-made policies: retroactive date 
requirements. The retroactive date can be thought of, in simple terms, as the start of the policy 
coverage period. These requirements state that for coverage to apply to a claim, the wrongful act 
giving rise to that claim must have taken place on or after the policy’s retroactive date—regardless of 
when the claim is ultimately made against the insured.  
Conversely, no coverage applies if the wrongful act took place prior to a policy’s retroactive date. For 
example, a January 1, 2010, retroactive date woul d bar coverage for claims resulting from acts that 
took place prior to that date, even if such claims ar e not made against the insured until after January 1, 
2010.  
The Purpose of Retroactive Dates 
There are two purposes of retroactive dates: (1) to eliminate coverage for situations or incidents 
known to the insured that have the potential to give rise to claims in the future and (2) to preclude 
coverage for “stale” claims that ar ise from events far in the past, ev en if such events are unknown to 
the insured.  
In the former case, the retroactive date preserves the principle of fortuity, that is, the insurer should 
not be called upon to cover the so- called “burning building.” In the latter instance, the retroactive date 
makes policies more affordable by precluding coverage  for events that, while theoretically insurable, 
are remote in time.  
Not All Policies Contain Retro Dates 
It is important to recognize that not all—alt hough the majority—of professional/executive liability 
policies are written with retroactive dates. Of course,  it is to the insured’s advantage if a policy does 
not include one. If an underwriter insists that a retroa ctive date be made part of a policy, it is also to 
the insured’s advantage if the retroactive date is as early as possible in time, thereby affording 
coverage for the greatest possible number of events.      Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
14 For example, if a policy has a term of January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2011, a January 1, 2006 
retroactive date is far preferable to a January 1, 2010 retroactive date. This  is because under the latter 
retroactive date, there would be no coverage for wrongful acts that took place prior to January 1, 
2010. In contrast, if the policy contained a January 1, 2006 retroactive date, coverage would only be 
precluded for wrongful acts that took place prior to January 1, 2006. In effect, the January 1, 2006 
retroactive date provides the insured with an additional 4-year “window” during which claims 
resulting from wrongful acts that took place from January 1, 2006 to January 1, 2010 would be covered by the policy (provided the claims associat ed with these acts are made against the insured 
during the 1/1/10–11 policy period). 
A Retroactive Date Alternative: E xcluding Coverage for a Specific Event 
Rather than writing a policy with a retroactive date, an underwriter can insert an exclusion for a specific event or events that could produce a claim in  the future. For example, assume that a personal 
injury attorney (insured under a lawyers professional liability polic y) represented a client who was 
seriously injured in an automobile accident. Also assume that the case was tried before a jury, yet the 
jury found in favor of the defendant driver who caused the claimant’s injuries. Under these 
circumstances, the client might allege that her failure to prevail in the case was the result of the 
attorney’s negligent presentation of her case to the jury. If the attorney decided to change insurers 
upon the expiration of his or her professional liabilit y policy, an underwriter could offer to write a 
policy without a retroactive date, on the condition that the policy would contain an exclusion should this specific situation produce a claim in the futu re. Although a potential claim that could arise from 
this incident would be precluded by such an endorsement, the insured attorney would still have coverage for all other potential claims that arose from wrongful acts that took place prior to the inception of the policy term.  
This approach is equitable because it protects th e underwriter from a known incident to which the 
policy should not rightfully be exposed. However, because the policy would not contain a retroactive 
date, it provides the insured with cove rage for unknown, fortuitous events. 
The foregoing points concerning retroactive dates are summarized in Exhibit 4.1. 
 
EXHIBIT 4.1 
KEY POINTS ABOUT RETROACTIVE DATES  
• It is preferable to have no retroactive date in a professional/executive 
liability policy. 
• If the insurer insists on a retroactive dat e, it is best to have it as early in 
time as possible. 
• A policy can be written without a retroactive date and yet exclude 
coverage for certain  enumerated “events.”

17 Chapter 5 
Applying Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
This chapter begins by summarizing the three cond itions required to trigger coverage under a claims-
made and reported policy that contains a retro active date. It continues by providing additional 
examples of how claims-made coverage triggers apply in actual claims situations and concludes by 
introducing the concept of discovery provisions, explai ning how they can be used by insureds to lock-
in coverage, even before a claim has been made against them.  
Conditions Precedent to Triggering Coverage 
The term “condition(s) precedent,” as used here, refers to an event (or set of events) that must first 
take place before coverage applies under a given insurance policy. For coverage to apply under a 
claims-made and reported policy that contains a re troactive date, the following three conditions must 
be met: 
• Retroactive Date Requirement —The wrongful act giving rise to the claim must have taken 
place on or after the policy’s retroactive date (which is normally specified in the policy’s 
declarations page). 
• Claims First Made Requirement —The claim must be first made against the insured, prior 
to the policy’s expiration date. 
• Reporting Requirement —The claim must be reported to the insurer within the reporting 
period of the policy. 
Applying the Conditions to a Claim Example 
Assume that an accountants’ professional liability po licy is written with a claims-made and reported 
coverage trigger provision. The policy has a term of January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2011 and contains 
a retroactive date of January 1, 2010 and a 60-da y reporting window. For coverage to apply under this 
policy: 
• the wrongful act giving rise to a claim must have taken place on or after January 1, 2010, 
Retroactive Date Requirement; 
• the claim must have been first made against the insured before the policy expired on January 
1, 2011, Claims First Made Requirement ; and  
• the claim must be reported to the insurer no later than March 2, 2011, Reporting Requirement 
(i.e., the 60th day following expiration of the policy). Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
18 Unless all three of these requiremen ts are met, coverage would no t be available under a professional 
liability policy written with a claims-made and reporte d coverage trigger provis ion that also included 
a retroactive date. Exhibit 5.1 provides an exampl e of the way an insurance policy written with a 
claims-made and reported coverage trigger—incl uding a retro date requirement and a 60-day 
reporting window—operates.

Coverage Application under the Medical Malpractice Example 
Now that the requirements necessary to trigger coverage under a claims-made and reported policy 
have been discussed, it is worthwhile to return to the previously-described medical malpractice 
example in Chapter 2 of this course.  
Assume that the following policies were in effect during the sequence of events described earlier and 
that all eight policies were written with claims-mad e and reported coverage tr iggers and all contained 
a January 1, 2002 retroactive date. 
   
Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
20 Policy Term  Event(s) 
1/1/06–1/1/07  Surgery performed 
1/1/07–1/1/08  Infection develops 
1/1/08–1/1/09  Illness develops, lawsuit threatened 1/1/09–1/1/10  Doctor served with summons, doctor reports claim to insurer

1/1/11–1/1/12  Settlement negotiations 1/1/12–1/1/13  Settlement negotiations 
1/1/13–1/1/14  Claim settled 
Coverage Applies Under the 1/1/09–10 Policy  
In this example, the claim against the physician was made during the January 1, 2009 to January 1, 
2010 policy period. As a result, the limits, deductibles, terms, and conditions of that policy would 
apply to the claim. The fact that different events  related to the claim took place during the other seven 
policy periods is of no consequence for the pur pose of determining which policy applies.  
Retroactive Date Requirement Sa tisfied Under the 1/1/09–10 Policy 
It is also important to note that the claim met the retroactive date requirement—i.e., the January 1, 
2009 to January 1, 2010 policy had a January 1, 2002  retroactive date, and the wrongful act that gave 
rise to the claim took place after that date.  
Reporting Requirement Satisfied Under the 1/1/09–10 Policy 
Finally, the claim met the reporting requirement—i. e., the claim was reported during the January 1, 
2009 to January 1, 2010 policy period.  
Discovery Provisions: The Option To Report “Potential Claims” 
From the insured’s standpoint, one of the problems inherent in claims-made policies is that unless a 
claim is made against an insured during the policy peri od, coverage will not be tr iggered. This is true 
even though the act, error, or omission was co mmitted during the policy period, and a claim is 
virtually certain to result. For example, a general surgeon who has a cocaine addiction passes out while performing a routine appendectomy. Immedi ately afterwards, the patient goes into cardiac 
arrest and dies. Although a claim probably will not be  filed for at least several months, legal action 
against the doctor is all-but-inevitable. Assume that the surgeon’s professional liability policy expires 
in 2 weeks. In this instance, coverage is not li kely to be available under the current policy because a 
formal claim cannot be reported to the insurer until the surgeon receives a formal claim (i.e., in the form of a summons and complaint). Making the situati on even worse for the doctor is the fact that on 
the day his policy expires, his medical license is suspended and as a result, his current insurer refuses to renew his professional liability coverage. Accordingl y, he will not be able to report the claim under 
his next policy since such coverage will not be available.  Chapter 5—Applying Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
21 The apparent lack of coverage under this scenario is  not as great a problem as it may first appear. This 
is because virtually all professional and executive lia bility insurance policies contain what are known 
as discovery provisions (also sometimes referred to as “notice of potential claim” or “awareness 
provisions”).  
Such provisions allow insureds to report to the insurer and thereby lock-in coverage for incidents or 
circumstances that may, in the future—but at the time they are reported—have not yet produced claims. In effect, discovery provisions allow an insu red to secure coverage for such events so that 
coverage will apply under the curre nt policy—regardless of how far in the future a claim is eventually 
made in conjunction with the incident that has been  reported. So in the foregoing example, if the 
surgeon reported the incident prior to the expiration of his current po licy, regardless of the fact that 
when he reported the incident to his insurer he had not received a formal claim, coverage for any 
future claim would be available under that policy, regardless of: (1) how far in the future a formal 
claim is made against the doctor and (2) regardl ess of whether or not the doctor’s current insurer 
refuses to renew the policy upon expiration.  
What is an “Incident” or “Potential Claim”? 
An “incident” or “potential claim” is any event or situation which does not immediately, but could, in 
the near future result in a claim. The following scenario offers an example of what would be 
considered a reportable “incident” under the discove ry provision of an employment practices liability 
insurance (EPLI) policy.  
After a heated and contentious exit interview on J une 24, 2009, during which an employee is advised 
that his job is being eliminated, the employee tells  the company’s human resources manager “after 20 
years with this company, this is a really raw d eal you’re giving me! I’m going to sue you personally, 
as well as this lousy company for everything it’s  worth.” After these re marks, the now-former 
employee storms out.  Although the company has not yet received a lawsuit,  given these circumstances, there is a reasonably 
high probability that it eventually will be sued, most likely for wrongful termination, a type of claim 
which would be covered by the EPLI policy. Accordingly, if the company were to provide details of 
this situation to its insurer, it would qualify as a “reportable incident” or “potential claim” under that 
policy’s discovery provision.  
Using Discovery Provisions To Prevent Coverage Gaps 
A professional or executive who notifies his or her insu rer of circumstances that could at some future 
time result in a claim would, as result, be in a position to minimize gaps in coverage when: (1) 
changing insurers or (2) discontinui ng coverage completely. This concep t is illustrated in Exhibit 5.2. 
 
    
 
 Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
22 EXHIBIT 5.2 
USING A DISCOVERY CLAUSE TO PREVENT COVERAGE GAPS  
Insured Changes Insurers 
In the situation noted by Exhib it 5.2, the insured replaced insure r A with insurer B on January 1, 
2012. Because the wrongful act/incident took place before  the January 1, 2012 retroactive date of B’s 
policy, B would not cover the claim (despite the fact that the claim was made against the insured 
during B’s policy). However, since the insured notified insurer A of the wrongful act/incident per the 
discovery provision, coverage applies under A’s policy, despite the fact that a claim was not made 
against the insured until after A’s policy had expired. 
Insured Discontinues Coverage Altogether 
Note also that even if the insured had comple tely discontinued carryi ng any professional liability 
coverage after his policy with Insurer A expired on 1/1/12, he still would have  had coverage for the 
claim under A’s policy. This is because coverage is  locked-in, once an incident is reported under a 
policy’s discovery provision—regardless of how far in the future a claim associat ed with that incident 
is eventually made ag ainst the insured. 
The “Specificity” Requirement 
One key aspect of discovery provisions is that they require insureds to report,  in considerable detail, 
the information associated with any given incident  or circumstances they feel could eventually 
produce a claim. Generally, discovery provisions requ ire insureds to report what the policies term 
“full particulars,” regarding a potential claim, including:  
• the specific act(s) surrounding it, including the date of the act(s);  
• a description of the injury or damages caused by the act; 
• details about how the insured became awar e of the incident or circumstances; 
• the reasons why the insured thinks the incident  could eventually give rise to a claim; and 
• an estimate of potential damages associ ated with the possible claim. 
Chapter 5—Applying Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
23 Note that in the wrongful termination example (above ), other than an estimate of potential damages, 
the information conveyed in the description of this incident would be sufficient to qualify as a 
reportable incident. 
Exercising a Discovery Provision 
Given the specificity requirement, to exercise the disc overy provision at the expiration of a policy, an 
insured physician would not be able to simply provide  a list of all the patients he or she treated within 
the preceding 3 months. Rather, the insured woul d be required to provide the date on which a 
problematic medical “incident” took place, describe th e nature of the treatment he provided, give an 
indication of why injuries could result from such trea tment, and make an estimate of the extent of any 
possible resulting injuries.  
In short, the purpose of the specificity requirement  found within discovery provisions is to prevent an 
insured from handing the insurer a blanket client list, (also known as a “laundry list”), unless it 
contains specific details as to why the insured believ es that a specific client has suffered some form of 
damage and that a claim could result as a consequence.  
EXHIBIT 5.3 
USFEUL SITUATIONS FOR DISCOVERY PROVISIONS  
Reporting an incident or circumstance under a policy’s discovery provision can be particularly 
valuable when an insured: 
• Plans to obtain coverage from another professional/executive liability insurer at expiration 
of his or her current policy 
• Intends to cancel his or her policy midterm (w hether or not he or she intends to replace it) 
• Receives notice from the insu rer that his or her policy is about to be canceled or will not 
be renewed 
• Retires from practice  
• Sells his or her practice 
• Merges with another professional organization 
• Refuses to provide additional services to a client for any reason (including nonpayment of 
bills for past services) 
• Discovers an error in his or her work, but before the client becomes  aware of the mistake 
• Confronts a client who expres ses dissatisfaction with servic es performed but has not yet 
expressed the intention to sue 
• Receives a request from a client to pr ovide additional, remedial services—without 
charge—to correct alleged deficiencies asso ciated with work that has already been 
performed 
Advantageous Uses of Discovery Provisions 
As already explained, discovery provisions can be invaluable for an insured in securing coverage 
when: (1) changing insurers and (2) when discontinuing coverage altogether.  
  
 Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
24 In addition, there are other, more specific situati ons, noted in Exhibit 5.3 ab ove, in which the use of 
discovery provisions can be especially advantage ous. If any of the conditions noted in the exhibit 
exist, the professional or executive should prepare—-prior to policy expiration or termination—a list 
of circumstances that could, at some time in the fu ture, give rise to claims and submit this list to the 
insurer. 
Exhibit 5.4 provides a number of profession-specific scenarios in which a discovery provision can 
and should be used to an insured’s advantage.  
 
EXHIBIT 5.4 
PROFESSION-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS WHERE DISCOVERY PROVISIONS  
WOULD BE VALUABLE  
In each of the four scenarios noted below, the insured, upon learning of the events described, 
should immediately notify her professional liabilit y insurer of a potential claim under the policy’s 
discovery provision, despite the fact that a claim has not yet been made against the insured.  
• Real Estate Broker’s E&O Policy.  A real estate broker closes a sale. Two weeks after 
the closing, the foundation of the home she sold collapses, causing extensive structural 
damage.  
• Director & Officer’s Liability Policy . A Fortune 100 corporation announces a quarterly 
loss of $2 per share. Wall Street analysts were  expecting a profit of 25 cents per share. 
The company’s stock price then drops from $75 to $50 during the next week.  
• Allied Healthcare Professional Liability Policy . While performing a massage, a 
physical therapist hears a loud “pop” in his client’s neck, immediately after which, the 
client can no longer move his neck and feels excruciating pain radiating down his arm.  
• Fiduciary Liability Policy . The corporate trustee for a company-sponsored, defined 
benefit pension plan announces to the company ’s employees that the plan will only be 
able to pay 50 percent of its promised benefits. This is due to heavy investment losses in 
sub-prime related investments. 
Catch-22 Aspects of Discovery Prov isions: To “Laundry List” or Not 
Despite the benefits they convey, discovery provisi ons are not without drawbacks. On the surface, it 
would appear to benefit an insured to notify his or her insurer of all possible, potential claims prior to 
policy expiration—a practice known as “laundry listing.” There are, however, four problems that may 
result when an insured engages in this practice.  
Higher Premiums in Renewal Policies 
Although a claim may not yet have been made, an unde rwriter will be inclined to provide a somewhat 
higher premium in renewal policies, given the potenti al claim(s) that the underwriter could be called 
on to pay in the future. A safety margin of this kind will increase the cost of an insured’s renewal 
policy(ies). 
   
 
 Chapter 5—Applying Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
25 Possible Cancellation/Nonrenewal 
Many underwriters believe that “frequency breeds severity.” Therefore, if an insured reports 
numerous incidents, it could indi cate recurring problems associated with the insured’s professional 
practice or corporation which might, at some time, eventually produce a catastrophic loss. 
Accordingly, if, in the underwriter’s perception,  an insured begins to over-report incidents, the 
underwriter may question the wisdom of continuing to insure him or her—at any premium—and may 
be inclined to cancel or refuse to renew upon expiration. 
Problems When Changing Insurers 
Reporting numerous incidents under discovery provisions makes it more difficult for the insured to secure replacement coverage should he or she decide  to change insurers. This is because when an 
insured discloses circumstances surrounding possible clai ms to an incumbent insurer, he or she must 
also reveal these circumstances (on the application form) to an insurer who is providing a quotation for a replacement policy. This has two important implications. First, the replacement insurer will not cover claims that may eventually be made in conjun ction with such incidents. Second, if several such 
circumstances are revealed on the application, th e prospective replacement insurer might become 
wary of the insured and decline to provide coverage.  
Possible Admission of Guilt 
If an insured reports an incident to an insurer, and the incident eventually  gives rise to a claim, 
evidence of that report will be discoverable by the claimant’s attorney during the litigation process. While a report of this kind is not necessarily an ad mission of an insured’s culpability, it nevertheless 
provides evidence that the professi onal/executive was concerned about either the level of competence 
with which his or her services were performed or about the outcome produced by the performance of 
those services. Either way, evidence of the report will make it more difficult to defend the insured 
against a claim. It is always advisable for insureds  to report all relevant information concerning an 
incident, especially any details that would absolve,  or at least mitigate the professional’s potential 
liability.  
When “Laundry Listing” Is Advantageous for the Insured 
A certain degree of selectivity is required when notifying an insurer of potential claims under a 
policy’s discovery provision. There is, however, one situation in which it is clearly advantageous to 
report every possible incident as a potential claim. This happens when an insurer will no longer be 
writing a specific line of coverage and therefore nonrenews or cancels all policies (of a certain coverage line, or in a specific territory, for example).  
In this case, an insured may consider reportin g more possible circumstances under a policy’s 
discovery provision than he or she ordinarily would be inclined if the policy were being renewed. By 
laundry listing these circumstances, the insured would not be faced with higher renewal premiums or 
possible cancellation/nonrenewal by the incumbent in surer. Also important is the fact that a 
replacement insurer would tend to be more understanding of an insured who “laundry lists” under 
these conditions, recognizing that the measure is more justifiable because there is no guarantee that the insured will be able to secure a replacement policy. 
When “Laundry Lists” Are Rejected 
On the other hand, “laundry lists” are often rejected by insurers. This is especially true if, as already noted, an insured merely compiles a list of all clie nts, cases, or projects conducted within the past Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
26 several years, without providing specific details a bout the acts that could result in potential liability 
associated with services rendered. Therefore, unde r most circumstances, an insured should only 
supply information about circumstances that he or  she believes—on a “good-faith” basis—have the 
potential for producing a claim.

1. Phoebe has a professional liability policy with a policy term of 6/1/10 to 6/1/11, a retroactive 
date of 6/1/09, and a 60-day post-policy reporti ng window. As a result of a wrongful act on 
12/1/08, a claim was made against Phoebe on 12/ 1/10 and reported to the insurer on 7/1/11. 
Based on this information, coverage for this claim : 
a. applies because the claim was first made after the retro date. 
b. applies because the claim was first made before the policy expired. 
c. does not apply because the claim was reported too late. 
d. does not apply because the wrongful act took place prior to the retro date.

followed his advice. The best way for Warbler to  lock in coverage by exercising a discovery 
provision in his policy is to: 
a. contact former clients, apologize, and return the fee charged for his services. 
b. continue to renew his policy with new retr o dates that coincide with each policy’s 
inception.  
c. give his insurer a list naming of all clie nts who received fund compensation with his 
assistance. 
d. give his insurer very specific details con cerning each client who might arguably have 
been undercompensated. 
5. After Dr. Mac deNife amputates a patient’s diseased left leg, she re-examines the chart and 
sees that she should have amputated the right leg which was in even worse condition, so, while the patient is still anaesthetized, she re moves the remaining right leg. Although both 
legs were diseased, Dr. deNife is nevertheless afraid she might be sued and reports the incident to her medical professional liability in surer. Which of the following could happen as 
a result of her reporting the incident to her current insurer? 
a. another insurance company will offer her a much lower premium in recognition of her 
honesty in reporting her own error to her current insurer. 
b. the current insurer refuses to renew her policy.  
c. the insurer posts her name on a laundry blacklist. 
d. the patient is much less likely to file a claim against her.

29 Chapter 6 
Complicating Factors in Applying Claims-Made Coverage 
Chapter 6 addresses two factors that often create co mplications in determining whether coverage 
applies under a claims-made policy in any given claim situation:  
1. When is a claim made?  
2. When does the wrongful act take place? 
When Is a Claim Made? 
Determining when a claim is made, is the first complicating factor in applying claims-made coverage 
triggers. Indeed, defining the exact time at whic h a claim is “made” for the purpose of satisfying the 
claims-made requirement is not always simple. Unfort unately, this issue is further complicated by the 
fact that there are a number of different ways in which the term “claim” is typically defined by professional liability policies. These definitions are not limited to, but most commonly include, the 
following. 
• “Claim” is notice to the insurer, by the insured, of an incident that could give rise to a claim in the future. 
• “Claim” is a “written demand” for money or services. 
• “Claim” is notification of a “criminal,” “adm inistrative,” “alternative dispute resolution 
proceeding,” or “EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) proceeding. 
• “Claim” is an investigation by a government agency or an investigation by any similar regulatory body 
“Claim” Is Notification of a Potential Claim 
 From the insured’s perspective, this definiti on is quite favorable because it affords the insured—
rather than the insurer or a claimant—control over  when the policy’s coverage is triggered. If an 
insured believes an incident could give rise to a claim in the future, by reporting the surrounding 
circumstances, he or she would be able to lock in coverage—regardless of how far in the future a 
claim is eventually made. In effect, this definition of “claim” allows the insured to trigger coverage by notifying the insurer of a poten tial claim via a policy’s discovery provision. (Discovery provisions 
were discussed earlier in Chapter 5 of this course.)  Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
30 “Claim” Is a Written Demand for Money or Services 
This definition of the term “claim” requires a “w ritten” demand for money or services to trigger a 
claim. At one time, insurers often specified that a “claim” was triggered by a “demand,” the 
implication being that an “oral” demand would also trigger a claim. However, such wording is rarely 
used today.  
“Claim” Is Notification of a “Civil,” “C riminal,” “Administrative,” “Alternative 
Dispute Resolution Proceeding, ” or “EEOC Proceeding”  
This definition triggers coverage when the insu red is notified (regardless of the source of the 
notification) that one (or more) of a variety of lega l/administrative actions have  been filed. This is a 
favorable definition because not only does notifica tion of a civil action (i.e., a claim alleging 
negligence) trigger a “claim,” but, in addition, the following events can also have this effect: 
• institution of a criminal action (which could ha ppen prior to the filing of a civil suit), 
• notification of an administrative inquiry (e.g., a professional disciplinary hearing),  
• alternative dispute resolution proceeding (e.g., a claimant’s demand for arbitration or mediation), or  
• an Equal Employment Opportunity Commissi on (EEOC) proceeding (e.g., a discrimination 
claim brought by an employee).  
The last bullet point is particularly important w ith respect to employment practices liability policies 
because an insured employer’s first awareness of an employee’s claim often comes via notification that the EEOC is investigating an employee’s comp laint against an employer—rather than by means 
of a civil lawsuit. 
“Claim” is an Investigation by a Government Agency or Regulatory Body 
This definition triggers coverage when a govern ment agency or regulatory body begins an 
investigation of an insured—even before any alle gations of civil or criminal wrongdoing have been 
made against an insured—or before any monetary damages have been alleged. Such definitions are 
also favorable for insureds, and in recent years, ha ve been applicable to a number of situations. For 
example, during the summer of 2006, more than 100 corporations were under investigation by either 
the Department of Justice or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with 
unlawful stock option backdating practices. Having such  investigations trigger a “claim” is important, 
because these kinds of investigations require insu reds to expend monies for defense costs, expenses 
which would have been covered by directors & office rs liability policies—even if such investigations 
never result in a civil lawsuit. Another example: an insurance agent is notified by the state by the state 
insurance department of claim handling-related co mplaints, made against her by several insureds. 
(Note: the distinction between this coverage tri gger—an investigation by a government agency or 
regulatory body—and the preceding trigger—notifi cation of a civil, criminal, administrative 
proceeding—is that in the latter situation, it is actually alleged that the insured has committed a 
wrongful act. In the former situation, there is only the possibility that such an act has been committed, 
which is why an investigation is necessary to determine if this is actually the case.) 
 
 
 Chapter 6—Complicating Factors in Applying Claims-Made Coverage 
31 When Is a Claim Made? Some Examples 
Returning once again to the medical malpractice ex ample discussed in Chapter 1 and again in Chapter 
5, will illustrate that, depending upon a policy’s pa rticular definition of “claim,” coverage can be 
triggered during a variety of policy periods.  
Notification of Incident 
During the actual surgical procedure (in 2006), the physician could have realized that he committed 
an error. At that point, he might have notified his insurer and, under the first definition of the term “claim,” (i.e., the physician’s notification of the incident) he would have tr iggered coverage under the 
January 1, 2006 to January 1, 2007 policy.  
Investigation by a Government  Agency or Regulatory Body 
Similarly, during the year the patient developed the infection (2007), the patient may have 
complained to the state medical board, accusing the doctor of making an error during the surgery. If, 
at that point the medical board opened an investiga tion, advised the doctor acco rdingly, who, in turn, 
notified his insurer, a claim would have been made  under the fourth definition of “claim” (above), 
thus triggering the January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2008 policy. 
Demand for Money or Services 
Using this definition of “claim,” coverage will not be triggered until the 1/1/09-10 policy period, 
because it was not until this period during which the doctor was actually served with a summons and 
complaint by the patient-claimant.  
This scenario illustrates the importance of the de finition of “claim” in a professional or executive 
liability policy. Clearly, the exact way in which “claim” is defined has a significant bearing upon 
which policy, in a series of policies, will actually r espond to that claim. As already emphasized, it is 
always in an insured’s best interest to have a policy with a definition of “claim” that allows an 
incident—rather than a claim—to trigger coverage . This is because when an incident triggers 
coverage, the insured controls th e coverage trigger, whereas when a claim triggers coverage, the 
insured must depend on another party (usually the claimant) to activate coverage. In effect, (1) the 
more control an insured has in triggering coverage  and (2) the earlier coverage is triggered (whether 
by an insured or someone else), the more favorab le the policy’s definition of “claim” is for the 
insured. 
When Does the Wrongful Act Take Place? 
The second complicating factor in determining the ap plication of coverage under policies written with 
claims-made coverage triggers is  arriving at the exact point in time at which the wrongful act took 
place.  
This is necessary to satisfy a retroactive date requirement, if present, in a policy. However, 
determining this point is not always a straight forward process because pr ofessional/executive liability 
claim situations often involve a series of separate but continuing acts that take place over an extended 
period of time. For instance, a professional liability cl aim against an attorney may have arisen out of 
several conferences in which advice on a single matter was rendered to a client during a 6-month 
period. Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
32 Unfortunately, few professional/executive liability insu rance policies provide a definition for arriving 
at the exact point in time at which a wrongful act takes place. Rather, the majo rity sidestep the issue 
by including a “wrongful act” definition pertaining only to the types of acts that are covered.  
When a Wrongful Act Takes Place: The General Rule  
Despite these ambiguities, for the purpose of assessing compliance with a retroactive date 
requirement, a wrongful act is, by custom and practice, generally considered to have taken place when the professional service/executive decision that  ultimately causes the loss or damage has been 
completed or should have been completed (but was not). This is as opposed to:  
• the time at which the service ultimately causes loss or damage,  
• the time at which the service commences,  
• when the professional discovers the loss or damage, or  
• when the claimant discovers the loss or damage. 
Determining the Time of a Wrongful Act: A Case Study 
The following example will clarify th is concept. Assume that an engineer is hired to design a roof 
structure for an office building. On January 1, 2009 , the plan for the roof is sealed (evidencing the 
fact that the design has been submitted and is the work  of that particular engineer). Three years later, 
on January 1, 2012, the roof collapses. It is later determined that the original design was incorrect 
because the size of the beams it specified were not ade quate for the load they bore. In this situation, 
the wrongful act can be considered to have ta ken place on January 1, 2009, because it was on that 
date that the engineer had actually finished pr oviding his professional services. This is as opposed to 
January 1, 2012, the date on which the professional error actually caused the loss. This is illustrated in 
Exhibit 6.1. 
 
EXHIBIT 6.1 
DETERMINING WHEN A WRONGFUL ACT TAKES PLACE  
 Despite the clarity of the example in Exhibit 6.1, the general rule indicated above does not completely 
solve the problem of determining exactly when a wrongful act tak es place. As was noted earlier in 
this section, evaluating situations in which a claim results from services rendered on a continuing 
basis unfortunately poses problems and often defies straightforward determinations.

33 Chapter 6 Review Questions  
1. Allen, a doctor, has professional liability in surance. Depending on the wording of the 
professional liability policy in question, any of the following scenarios might fit the definition 
of a “claim,” except:  
a. A client sends Allen a letter demanding that Allen pay her money as compensation for 
her financial loss resulting from his wrongful act. 
b. Allen fails to meet the continuing edu cation requirements necessary to retain his 
professional license. 
c. Allen notifies the insurer of an incident that might result in a claim. 
d. The Internal Revenue Service begins investigating Allen. 
2. Violet Green’s professional liability policy from Brown Tree Insurance Company (BTIC) defines “claim” as “a written demand for money or services.” As compared with other possible definitions of “claim,” this definiti on has all of the following characteristics, except : 
a. It includes situations in which the insured is made aware of an incident that could give 
rise to a demand for damages. 
b. It is more precise than a definition specifying that a claim is triggered by a “demand for money or services.”  
c. It is rarely used today. 
d. It precludes the possibility that coverage might be triggered by an oral demand. 
3. Dr. Sparrow prescribes pills for a female patient during Year 1. She becomes pregnant during Year 2 and gives birth to a child during Year 3. In Year 4, Dr. Sparrow learns of studies 
demonstrating that the pills can adversely affect a fetus. During Year 5, the patient sues Dr. 
Sparrow, demanding $10 million, at which time th e doctor reports the claim to his insurer. 
The child is closely monitored. In Year 7, th e child begins to show symptoms. Dr. Sparrow 
had a different claims-made policy every calenda r year, but all policies had the same January 
1, Year 1 retroactive date. If his policy defined claim as “a demand for money or services,” 
Dr. Sparrow could have tri ggered coverage as early as: 
a. Year 1. 
b. Year 4.  
c. Year 5. 
d. Year 7.

35 Chapter 7 
Causes of Potential Claims-Made Coverage Gaps 
Policies written on a claims-made basis have th e potential to produce coverage gaps. Chapter 7 
discusses the three ways in which su ch gaps are created. Exhibit 7.1 lists the three most common 
circumstances under which gaps in claims-made policies arise. 
 
EXHIBIT 7.1 
POTENTIAL CAUSES OF CLAIMS-MADE COVERAGE GAPS  
• Retroactive date advancement 
• Cancellation or nonrenewal by insurer or insured 
• Replacement of claims-made policy with occurrence policy 
Retroactive Date Advancement 
Retroactive date advancement is a situation in which a policy’s retroac tive date is later than the date 
the policy it is replacing (e.g., expiring policy retroac tive date: 1/1/10; renewal policy retroactive date 
1/1/11). Although it is rare for an incumbent insurer to offer a renewal policy with a later retroactive 
date, insurers occasionally do so. The example in Exhibit 7.2 demonstrates the effects of a later 
retroactive date advancemen t in a replacement policy. 
 
EXHIBIT 7.2 
THE EFFECT OF RETROACTIVE DATE ADVANCEMENT  
 
Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
36 An insured had five consecutive, 1-year policies written by XYZ insurance company from January 1, 
2007 to January 1, 2012. All five of the policies in force during this time contained a January 1, 2007 
retroactive date. On January 1, 2012, the insured d ecides to change insurers. The new insurer offers a 
policy with a January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2013 term  that contains a January 1, 2012 retroactive date. 
The advanced retroactive date will preclude coverage for claims from wrongful acts that took place before January 1, 2012 (the new retroactive date),  if claims produced by those acts are made during 
the January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2013 policy period. 
In this example, the claim made against the insured during the re placement insurer’s policy will not 
be covered by that policy. This is because the wrongf ul act that gave rise to the claim resulted from a 
wrongful act that took place prior to the replacement insurer’s 1/1/12 retroactive date. On the other 
hand, had the retroactive date remained at January  1, 2007, claims made during the new January 1, 
2012/2013 policy period—that resulted from wrongful acts taking place on or after January 1, 2007—
will be covered.  
Cancellation or Nonrenewal by the Insurer or Insured  
The second way in which a coverage gap can be created is if an insurer (or insured) decides to cancel 
or nonrenew a policy written on a claims-made basis and the insured does not replace the policy. The 
gap results because there will be no coverage for claims arising from wrongful acts that took place 
during the term of the now-expired/canceled policy period that are made against the insured after the 
policy has expired/been canceled (unless the insured has exercised a specific discovery provision for 
that expiring policy). Exhibit 7.3 illustrates this situation.  
EXHIBIT 7.3 
COVERAGE GAP CAUSED BY NONRENEWAL OR CANCELLATION  
 
The third event that can create a coverage gap is when an insured switches from a claims-made to an 
occurrence policy (although this is  an unusual event). This is b ecause there will be no coverage for 
Chapter 7—Causes of Potentia l Claims-Made Coverage Gaps 
37 claims that result from wrongful acts that took place before  the inception of the occurrence policy, 
which are made during  the term of the replacement occurren ce policy. Exhibit 7.4 illustrates this 
situation. 
 
EXHIBIT 7.4 
CHANGE FROM CLAIMS-MADE TO OCCURRENCE POLICY  
 
None of the four policies noted in Exhibit 7.4 would cover the claim, for the following reasons. 
• No Coverage under Claims-Made Policies . The January 1, 2013/2014 claims-made policy 
had expired on the date the claim was made. C overage under this policy will apply only if the 
claim is made against the insured between 1/1/ 13 and 1/1/14. The fact that the wrongful act 
producing the claim took place during this time  period is of no bearing in determining 
coverage. For coverage to apply to the wrongful act, a claim associated with that wrongful act 
must be made during the term of a claims-made policy. 
• No Coverage under Occurrence Policy . The January 1, 2015/2016 occurrence policy would 
not cover the claim because the wrongful act giving rise to the claim occurred before the 
inception of the policy. Under an occurrence polic y, coverage is triggered by the occurrence 
of a wrongful act—not by the making of a claim associated with that wrongful act.

1. Thomas Train has had three professional liability policies from three different  insurers 
covering these dates: Policy A—June 1, 2010–June 1, 2011; Policy B—June 1, 2011–June 1, 
2012; and Policy C—June 1, 2012–June 1, 2013. Policies A and B have a retroactive date of 
June 1, 2010, and Policy C has a retroactive date  of June 1, 2012. An error or omission likely 
to result in a claim occurred on March 11, 2011.  Thomas informed his insurer of the incident 
on May 11, 2011. A claim was made against Thomas on July 11, 2012 based on the March 
11, 2011 incident. Based on this information: 
a. coverage applies under Policy A. 
b. coverage applies under Policy B. 
c. coverage applies under Policy C. 
d. no coverage applies. 
2. Perry Winkel retired on June 1, 2013 and di d not renew his professional liability coverage. 
Before retiring, he had prof essional liability policies from three different insurers covering

2011–June 1, 2012 (claims-made policy); and Policy C—June 1, 2012–June 1, 2013 
(occurrence policy). Both claims-made policies ha d retroactive dates of June 1, 2010, and 
neither had a discovery provision. An error or omission likely to result in a claim occurred on 
March 11, 2011 but no claim based on that incident was made until September 11, 2012. Based on this information, it is most likely that: 
a. coverage applies under Policy A. 
b. coverage applies under Policy C.  
c. coverage applies under Policies A, B, and C. 
d. no coverage applies. 
 
 
 
    
Answers to Chapter 7 Review Questions 
1. a. Coverage was triggered under Policy A, when the incident likely to produce a claim was reported 
to the insurer on May 11, 2011. Under that policy’ s discovery provision, coverage for the claim will 
apply under Policy A, regardless of how far in the fu ture the incident mature s into a formal claim. 
2. d. No claim was made during the term of a claims-made policy, and no occu rrence took place during 
the term of the occurrence policy.   
39 Chapter 8 
Closing Coverage Gaps in  Claims-Made Policies 
Chapter 8 explains how to close the three types of coverage gaps, discussed in the preceding chapter, 
that are sometimes created within claims-made cove rage triggers. The two methods of closing these 
gaps include (1) purchasing an extended reporting en dorsement or (2) obtaining prior acts coverage in 
a replacement policy. 
Extended Reporting Periods 
Purchasing an extended reporting period (ERP) endorsement is the first method of closing gaps in claims-made coverage. An ERP permits an insured to  report claims that are made after a policy period 
has expired or been canceled, provided the wrongful act giving rise to the claim took place during the expired/canceled policy term. (ERP s are sometimes referred to as and are synonymous with the terms 
“reporting tails” and “tail cove rage,” although this course w ill not use that terminology.) 
Using an Extended Reporting Period to Close Coverage Gaps 
Exhibit 8.1 provides an example of how an extended reporting period can be used to close a coverage 
gap.  
There are two important points that should be observed about the example in Exhibit 8.1.  
• Wrongful Act Must Take Place Prior to Policy Expiration . Extended reporting provisions 
apply only if the wrongful act took place before termination of the policy. Thus, there is no 
coverage under an ERP if the wrongful act is committed during the ERP. Accordingly, in 
Exhibit 8.1, had the wrongful act taken place duri ng the ERP, there would be no coverage for 
the resulting claim—despite the fact that the claim was also reported to the insurer during the 
ERP.  
• Limited Time Period . Extended reporting provisions typically apply for a limited period of 
time. The example in Exhibit 8.1 depicted a 1-year ERP. Most professional/executive liability 
extended reporting provisions are for 1 year. Occasionally, insurers will offer, and insureds 
will purchase, ERPs of longer duration. As a result, in Exhibit 8.1, which depicted a 1-year ERP, there would have been no coverage for th e claim, if, for example, it had been reported 
after the ERP expired on 1/1/13 (unless the insure d had purchased an ERP of longer than a 1-
year duration). Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
40 Important Extended Reporting Period Terms 
There are several key aspects of extended reportin g period provisions that should be reviewed 
carefully. Each of these items will be discussed in more detail in succeeding paragraphs. 
 
EXHIBIT 8.1 
APPLICATION OF AN EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD  
Insured’s Right To Purchase an ERP 
The vast majority of insurers’ policies provide  an extended reporting period if cancellation or 
nonrenewal is at either the insure d’s or the insurer’s option. This is known as a two-way or bilateral 
ERP.  
At one time, a significant minority of insurer’s forms only offered an ERP if the insurer opted to 
cancel or nonrenew the policy. This is known as a one-way or unilateral ERP. However, given a 
competitive professional/executive liability market since the early 2000s, policy forms providing a 
one-way ERP have become a rarity.  
Clearly, two-way ERPs are much more advantageous  for an insured, compared to a one-way ERP. 
This is because if an insured decides to change insurers, there w ill be an automatic coverage gap 
unless it is able to buy an ERP. However, this is  not permissible under a policy containing a one-way 
ERP provision, since, under such policies, an insured can purchase an ERP only if the insurer cancels 
or nonrenews a policy. These circumstances make it extremely difficult for an insured to change 
Chapter 8—Closing Coverage Gaps in Claims-Made Policies 
41 insurers, unless the current insurer decides to cancel or non-renew. A ccordingly, insureds should not 
accept a policy form containing a one-way ERP provision. 
Duration of ERP 
As already noted, most commonly, professional/exe cutive liability policy forms offer an ERP of 1 
year’s duration. However, ERP provisions are occasi onally worded so that the insured has the option 
of selecting one of several different ERP lengths. Of  course, this is advantageous for the insured, 
because, depending on an insured’s business situati on and assessment of potential exposure to claims, 
it can select the ERP duration option it considers best. 
ERP Pricing 
Premiums for ERPs vary, but generally fall betw een 50 percent and 150 percent of the expiring 
policy’s annual premium, for a 1-year ERP. The premium the insurer will charge for the ERP should 
always be specified in the policy (as a percenta ge of the current premium). However, professional 
liability policies sometimes contain ERP provisions noting that premiums will be determined 
“according to the company’s rules and rates at th e time the extended reporting period is purchased.” 
Unfortunately for the insured, such a provisi on functions as a “blank check” for the insurer—a 
situation that is not in an insured’s best inter ests. This underscores the need to agree on specific 
pricing of an ERP prior to policy inception, if a specific premiu m is not enumerated in the policy. 
Time Allowed To Purchase ERP 
Some policies grant as many as 60 days in which to purchase an ERP following expiration of the policy. However, 30 days is the most common period of time (following expiration of the policy) in which the insured is given to make the election to  purchase an ERP. Of course, the longer the period 
of time available to exercise this op tion, the better for the insured.  
No Reinstatement of Limits 
Virtually all ERP provisions state that purchasing an ERP does not “reinstate” policy limits. For example, assume an insured purchased a professi onal liability policy with  a $1 million aggregate 
limit. Also assume that during the policy term a claim was made against the insured and that the 
insurer paid $250,000 for legal expen ses and settlement costs in conjunction with that claim. If, at the 
expiration of the policy, the insured purchases an ERP, only $750,000 of cove rage will be available 
for any claims reported during the ERP. Therefore,  no additional limits will be added to the ERP 
simply because actual (or potential claim dollars) have  been/will be paid, in conjunction with claims 
made during the expiring policy period.  
Automatic Extended Reporting Provisions 
Under some professional liability policies (although rarely under executive liability policy forms), 
insurers make available what are termed “automatic” ERPs. These provisions operate in a manner identical to standard ERPs, with three differences. First, they apply for only limited periods of time, 
typically 30 or 60 days following cancellation or nonrenewal of the policy. Second, they are offered at no additional premium charge. Obviously, such provisions are favorable for insureds. Third, under 
most policies, automatic ERPs are offered on a one-way basis (i.e., they are available only if cancellation or nonrenewal is at the insurer’s option), while under a minority of forms they are offered on a two-way basis (i.e., they are available regardless of whether cancellation or nonrenewal 
is at the insurer’s or the insured’s option). Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
42 Coverage for “Notice of Circumstances” during ERP 
A key variation between the ERPs in professional/e xecutive liability forms is whether a report of 
circumstances or incidents that have the potential—bu t have not yet resulted in a formal claim against 
the insured—are covered by an ERP. In effect, under some insurers’ ERP wording, the policy’s 
discovery provision is operative, whereas in others, it is not.  
Case in point: a D&O liability policy expires on Janua ry 1, 2012, at which time the organization buys 
a 1-year ERP. On August 1, 2012, the organiza tion becomes aware of circumstances that could 
potentially materialize into a formal claim, but have  not yet. Under some insurers’ ERP wording, the 
report of circumstances to the insurer would tri gger coverage. However, under other insurers’ ERP 
wording, no coverage would apply until the organiza tion has a formal claim made against it. Given 
this situation, the insured woul d be compelled to purchase another ERP at the expiration of the 
current ERP, if the potential claim had not yet been made against the company—but a claim was 
expected at some point. One key caveat is that under no insurers’ forms  will coverage apply if the wrongful act that gave rise 
to the claim also took place during the ERP. Rather, under all ERPs, the wrongful act must always 
take place during the expired or canceled policy pe riod that preceded the term of the ERP. For 
example, after the expiration of its January 1, 2013-14 D&O policy, a corporation buys an ERP with a 
January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2015 term. On March 1, 2014, the corporation acquired the XYZ 
Company. As part of the acquisition, it agreed to pay XYZ’s stockholders $500 per share.  On July 1, 
2014, the corporation is named a class action laws uit, alleging that the company’s directors and 
officers vastly overpaid XYZ’s stockholders as part of  the acquisition deal. In this instance, no form 
of ERP would provide coverage because the wrongful  act that gave rise to the claim—the agreement 
to pay XYZ shareholders $500 per share—took place during the ERP, rather than during the expired policy period. This concept is illustrated in Exhibit 8.2.

COVERAGE/LACK OF COVERAGE FOR “NOTICE OF CIRCUMSTANCES”  
DURING AN ERP: TWO EXAMPLES  
Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
44 Situations in Which Purchasing an ERP Is Prohibited 
A few insurers’ forms bar insureds from purchasing ERPs  in certain situations, despite the fact that 
ERPs would otherwise be available. For the most part, these restrictions apply in situations where 
previous or expected moral hazard could be consid ered a problem. Specifically, the following are the 
most common instances in which an insured may be prohibited from purchasing an extended 
reporting period: 
• cancellation of the policy due to nonpayment of premium,  
• cancellation resulting from failure to reimburse  deductible amounts for previous claims,  
• cancellation due to breach of policy conditions (e .g., material, intentional misstatements on 
the application), or  
• suspension/revocation of an insured’s professional license.  
Such restrictions are justifiable given the problems that could result if such an insured were permitted 
to buy an ERP. 
Restrictive Extended Reporting Provisions 
As discussed previously, some insurers offer merely  a one-way tail, whereby an ERP is available only 
in the event that the insurer—ra ther than the insured—cancels or  nonrenews the policy. However, 
some insurers offer an even more restrictive vers ion of the one-way tail by also including language 
stating that an offer to renew a policy at a di fferent premium does not constitute nonrenewal. Such 
provisions are unfair because, in the event that an insurer no longer wished to cover a specific insured 
and also wanted to avoid the neces sity of providing ERP c overage, it could, for example, simply triple 
the renewal premium. Under these conditions, the insured would have no choi ce but to nonrenew and 
would therefore be unable to purchase an ERP.  
Another variation of this provision also consid ers renewal quotations with different deductible 
amounts, policy limits, or policy provisions, as not co nstituting nonrenewal by the insurer. Thus, if an 
insurer were to double a policy’s deductible, halve the policy’s limit, and add a number of exclusions 
that substantially restricted the scope of covera ge—and the insured failed to renew—a provision of 
this kind would relieve the insurer of the obliga tion to offer an ERP under these circumstances. When 
such provisions are found within policies containing one-way ERPs, the results can be unfair for 
insureds and they should strongly object to them. 
Implications of ERP Coverage Terms and Premiums 
ERP coverage terms and premiums should always be discussed during purchase negotiations because little leverage remains with the insured after cove rage is bound. Moreover, insurers are even less 
likely to agree upon broadened ERP provisions on ce a policy has been cancel ed, nonrenewed, or has 
expired. 
Admitted versus Nonadmitted 
Whether a policy is written on an admitted or nonadm itted basis also has a bearing on the breadth of 
ERP coverage that an insurer will be likely to  offer. Nonadmitted policy forms do not require 
approval from the various state insurance department s in which they are written. Therefore, unlike 
admitted forms (which usually are required to offer broader ERP coverage), they do not need to 
include expansive ERP provisions a nd can consequently be written at a lower price. Conversely, the 
ERP provisions contained in admitted forms add cons iderably to the cost of such policies. Thus, Chapter 8—Closing Coverage Gaps in Claims-Made Policies 
45 admitted policies tend to offer more favorable extended reporting period provisions than their 
nonadmitted counterparts, albeit at a higher premium. 
Runoff Provisions 
Like ERP provisions, runoff provisions also permit an insured to report claims (that resulted from 
wrongful acts taking place during prior policy periods) for a specified length of time in the future, 
following policy termination or cancellation. Howeve r, in contrast to ERPs, runoff provisions are 
typically restricted to situations in which a professional retires or reorganizes by becoming affiliated with a different professional organization. In a D& O context, runoff provisions are usually purchased 
when one organization acquires or merges with another; that is, the acquired company often 
purchases a runoff policy to cover wrongful acts that took place prior to the acquisition (but are not 
reported to the insurer until after the acquisition has been completed).  
In other words, runoff provisions  are generally not used when one  insurer is being replaced by a 
different insurer, as is normally the case with extended reporting endorsements. Rather, they are 
purchased when an insured no longer offers professi onal services or when a business is acquired by 
another and ceases to do business under its pre-acquisition name. 
Two Types of Runoff Provisions 
There are two basic types of runoff provisions. The firs t type of runoff provision is written so that the 
insured pays a lump sum amount upon terminati ng his practice (or following acquisition of one 
corporation by another). This premium then allo ws the reporting of claims for a number of years 
thereafter, generally 3 to 6 years. The second type  of runoff provision is written with renewable 1-
year terms, whereby the premium in each succeedi ng year is lower, reflecting the reduced potential 
for claims against the insured. Normally, the terms of runoff provisions are not stated in policy forms. 
Rather, they are offered to the insured and negotiated at the time they are purchased. 
Prior Acts Coverage 
Obtaining replacement coverage that includes prio r acts coverage is the second way in which gaps 
caused by claims-made policies can be closed.  
Key Definitions 
There is an important difference between covera ge written on a full prior acts basis and coverage 
written on a prior acts basis.  
Full Prior Acts Coverage 
Insurers offering claims-made coverage with no retroactive date are providing full prior acts 
coverage.  
Prior Acts Coverage 
Insurers offering claims-made coverage with the same  retroactive date as the policy it is replacing, is 
providing prior acts coverage. 
Under both full prior acts and prior acts coverage, th ere will be no gaps created by the change from 
one claims-made insurer to another. Exhibit 8.3 illustrates this concept. 
 Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
46 EXHIBIT 8.3 
PRIOR ACTS COVERAGE IN A REPLACEMENT POLICY  
 
Alternatives to Full Prior Acts Coverage 
There are several alternatives to providing full (i .e., no retroactive date) prior acts coverage.  
Prior Acts Coverage with Same Re troactive Date as Prior Insurer 
Most often, when an insured obtains replace ment of an existing professional/executive liability 
policy, the replacement insurer writes a policy with a retroactive date that is  the same as the insurer 
that it is replacing. This has the effect of prev enting any coverage gaps for the insured because the 
replacement insurer will cover any claims that resulte d from acts during the prior insurer’s policy, if 
claims resulting from such acts are made dur ing the replacement insurer’s policy term. 
 
Chapter 8—Closing Coverage Gaps in Claims-Made Policies 
47 Prior Acts Coverage with Same Retroac tive Date as Initial PL/EL Policy 
Alternatively, replacement insurers will also offer to write coverage containing the same retroactive 
date as the insured’s first PL/EL policy. This h as the effect of covering any claim resulting from a 
wrongful act that took place during any previous policy, provided the claim is made against the 
insured during the replacement insurer’s policy term. This approach not only prevents any coverage 
gaps between the replacement policy and the previous insurers’ policies, but it also assures coverage 
for any act that took place since the insured first bega n buying PL/EL insurance. This alternative is, of 
course, more favorable for an insured than a policy written on a prior acts basis with the same retroactive date as the prior insurer (noted above). 
Limited Prior Acts Coverage 
As an alternative to providing full prior acts coverage, some insurers are willing to write a replacement policy offering a limited form of coverage for prior acts. Specifically, this would cover acts that took place during a specified period of time (e.g., 1 to 5 years) prior to the inception date of the replacement policy. An approach of this kind is often a workable solution to the problem of 
obtaining prior acts protection when changing prof essional liability insurers. In most instances, 5 
years of prior acts coverage would provide protection for reasonably foreseeable claims arising from 
acts that took place during expired policy periods. At the same time, by restricting prior acts coverage 
to 5 years, the insurer is not subjected to “stale” claims that could have been caused by acts far in the past. 
Prior Acts Coverage Using Claims-Made Step Rates 
Given the foregoing situation, some insurers will pr ovide prior acts coverage in claims-made policies 
(that replace a prior insurer’s policy) by using what are known as “step rates.” Such rates apply on a 
sliding scale so that the longer the period of prio r acts coverage applicable, the higher the premium 
rate. For example, assume that an insured seeks quotations for various durations of prior acts 
coverage. If this were the case, an underwriter might  provide a quotation based on the table noted by 
Exhibit 8.4. The step rate in the right hand colu mn indicates the amount by which the premium for a 
January 1, 2012/2013 policy would be multiplied to provide prior acts coverage for the corresponding 
number of years.

 Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
48 An Example 
Assume that the premium for a January 1, 2012/2013 policy with a January 1, 2012 retroactive date is 
$10,000. (Such a policy would afford no prior acts cove rage.) Based on the step rates given in Exhibit 
8.4, if the policy were instead written with a January  1, 2007 retroactive date (so as to provide 5 years 
of prior acts coverage), the premium would be $21, 000 (i.e., $10,000 x 2.1). If the policy were written 
with 3 years of prior acts coverage, the premium would be $19,000 ($10,000 x 1.9).  
Why Prior Acts Coverage Is Frequently Available 
Although underwriters offering prior acts coverage are exposed to claims from acts that took place 
before they covered an insured, there are sever al incentives for provid ing insurance under these 
circumstances. 
No Coverage for Known Incidents 
Despite an underwriter’s additional risk when offering prior acts coverage, insu rers will do so only on 
the basis that the policy does not extend to any known incidents that have not yet, but could, give rise 
to claims in the future. This is because virtually all applications for professional/executive liability insurance require the insured to warrant that he or  she knows of no incidents which could be expected 
to produce future claims. Accordingly, any known incidents will be specifically excluded by 
endorsement in a policy that offers prior acts coverage. 
Limited Prior Acts Coverage Approach 
There is an alternative to offering full prior acts cove rage (i.e., coverage with no retroactive date). An 
underwriter could, for example, issue a policy with a retroactive date that is 5 years prior to the 
replacement policy’s inception date. On that basis,  the underwriter can still charge a mature claims-
made premium, while limiting his or her exposure w ith a 5-year cut-off date. For example, referring 
to Exhibit 8.3, above, because Insurer B provided a policy with a 1/1/12 retroactive date, the insurer 
has limited its exposure to claims from wrongful acts that took place prior to January 1, 2007 (i.e., 
wrongful acts that took place more than 5 years prior to the inception of B’s 1/1/17–18 policy will not be covered).  
Higher Premiums 
Offering prior acts coverage allows an underwriter to  charge the insured a higher premium than could 
normally be justified for an ordinary first-year claims-made policy. Affording prior acts coverage 
gives an underwriter the right to charge what is called a “mature claims-made rate,” which can often be a significant multiple of a first-year policy premium that provides no prior acts coverage. For example, in Exhibit 8.3, had the replacement insure r B provided a 1/1/17 retroactive date—instead of 
a 1/1/12 retroactive date—it would have had to char ge a much lower premium. This is because under 
a policy with a 1/1/17 retroactive date, coverage w ould only apply to claims caused by wrongful acts 
taking place on or after 1/1/17. Although such an  arrangement considerably limits insurer B’s 
exposure to claims, a policy written on this basis is mu ch less valuable to an insured, compared to one 
containing a 1/1/12 retroactive date. 
Why Prior Acts Coverage Is Not Always Available  
Although affording prior acts coverage by a repl acement insurer eliminates the potential for coverage 
gaps when changing insurers, it is not always po ssible to obtain such coverage, for three reasons. Chapter 8—Closing Coverage Gaps in Claims-Made Policies 
49 Lack of Information about Insured in Previous Years 
First, many insurers believe that since they were  not covering the insured during the prior years (and 
yet could be responsible for acts that took place dur ing that time), they should not presently be placed 
in a position to assume such risks. Although insurers can obtain information about an insured’s 
current professional practice (and are therefore in  a position to make assessments about future 
exposures and loss potential), they cannot do so for previous years. As a result, some professional 
liability insurers simply refuse to provide prior acts coverage at any price. 
Moral Hazard during Non-Insured Years 
Second, underwriters are reluctant to furnish prio r acts coverage applying to years in which the 
insured did not maintain insurance. Thus, when a professional who was never previously insured, 
requests coverage for the first time—and also requests prior acts coverage—this poses a possible 
moral hazard. Clearly, their sudden desire to buy insurance might suggest their intent to report a claim 
resulting from an act that took place from a period du ring which they did not maintain insurance. 
An Insured’s Marginal Loss History 
A third reason for an underwriter to be reticent a bout providing prior acts coverage is an insured’s 
marginal loss history. If the insured has reported a number of claims recently, an underwriter will be 
concerned about additional claims that have yet to  be made, but could be at some future time. 
Similarly, an underwriter would also be wary if such an insured did not have a loss control in place in previous years but suddenly becomes very interest ed in developing one at the time that prior acts 
coverage is being sought.

53 Chapter 9 
The Rationale for Claims-Made Insurance 
This chapter explains why the insurance industry uses claims-made coverage triggers in professional 
and executive liability policies: (1) they improve the ability of underwriters and actuaries to project 
ultimate claim liabilities for a given book of business, and (2) they assist in determining which insurer 
(in a series of insurers) is liable for a specific cl aim situation where the date on which the wrongful 
act giving rise to the claim took place is unclear. 
Increased Predictability of Claim Liabilities 
It is inherently difficult to project the amount of money that will ultimately be paid out under a given 
set of insurance policies written w ith occurrence triggers. Under occurrence policies, coverage is 
triggered by a wrongful act (e.g., a physician’s e rror), compared to a claims-made policy, where 
coverage would, in this instance, be triggered by the making of a claim against the physician as a 
result of the physician’s wrongful act. Occurrence po licies require an underwriter to predict expected 
ultimate losses in year 1, despite the fact that many  of the claims applying to that policy period will 
not even be made for a number of years after that policy has expired.  
Given the time lags between wrongful professiona l acts and the making of claims, underwriters 
offering occurrence coverage must charge a premium to cover claims that may not even be made 
against the insured for 10 or more years after the policy expires. 
Three problems make it difficult to determine the premium that should be charged for occurrence 
coverage: (1) time lags in making claims agains t professionals and executives, (2) the problem of 
incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, and (3 ) the fact that inflation causes insurers to 
underestimate their ultimate dollar liabilities on claims that require many years to close. These 
problems and the ways in which claims-made polic ies solve them are discussed in the following 
pages. 
Time Lags in Making Claims 
There are four reasons for the significant time lags between the date on which most wrongful 
professional acts take place and the date on which they result in claims made against professionals.  
Time Necessary for Injuries/Damages To Cause Damage/Injury 
Claims against attorneys who draw up wills provide a clear example of the fact that wrongful acts 
often do not immediately cause injuries. Assume that on January 1, 2006, a lawyer drafts a will for a 
client who requests that all proceeds of his estate go to his current wife. The client dies 5 years later Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
54 on January 1, 2011. When the client’s  will is probated after his death, it is determined that the lawyer 
committed an error in drafting the client’s will, which allows his first wife to collect half the proceeds 
of his estate, much to the chagrin of his current wife  who then sues the lawyer. In this situation, there 
was a 5-year lag between the date of the wrongf ul act and date on which the act caused injury. 
Time Necessary for Injuries /Damages To Be Discovered 
Claims against surgeons provide an example of the fact that there is often a lag between the time a 
wrongful act causes damage and the date on which the damage is actually discovered. Assume that in 
Year 1, a surgeon accidentally left a sponge in a patient’s stomach during an operation. Although the 
sponge actually begins to cause damage from the mome nt it was left inside the patient’s body, the 
patient does not begin to experience physical problems until year 5, when it is discovered that he now 
has a softball-size growth in his stomach, as a result of the sponge being left inside.  
Claimants Do Not Always Seek  Immediate Legal Redress 
Even after discovering an injury arising out of a professional service or executive act, some people 
are reluctant to bring a lawsuit. There are three reasons for this: 
• Lack of Awareness.  They are not immediately aware of the true severity of the injury. For 
example, in the above case of the surgeon, the pa tient, even after being told of the growth in 
his stomach, may not sue the surgeon for 2 add itional years, until he is advised that the 
growth is malignant. 
• Difficulty in Connecting Injury with Specific Professional . They discover an injury but are 
initially unable to attribute it to a specific individual and therefore do not immediately make a claim. For example, the patient in this exam ple may have had surgery performed by three 
different doctors within the previous 5 years.  
• Personal Relationships.  They are reticent to sue a professional with whom they have had a 
previously satisfactory relationship. In the case of the lawyer, the decedent’s wife, even after learning of the lawyer’s mistake, may be reluct ant to sue immediately, given the attorney’s 
30-year relationship with her family.  
Attorneys Intentionally Delay Filing Suit 
There are several reasons attorneys delay making claims.  
• Potential Damages Increase. In certain cases, injuries worsen substantially over time, and attorneys often feel it is advantageous to make  an initial claim for a larger sum rather than 
increasing the size of the amount demanded as th e injury or damage becomes progressively 
worse.  
• Increased Policy Limits.  Others, recognizing the claims-made nature of most 
professional/executive liability insurance covera ge, are aware that over time, professionals 
tend to increase the size of the policy limits they maintain. Since the limit of coverage that is in force at the time the claim is made is the one that will be available (rather than the one that is in place at the time the wrongful act took place), attorneys often prefer to wait several years so a higher potential coverage limit will be available.  
 
 Chapter 9—The Rationale for Claims-Made Insurance 
55 • Time Created by Statutes of Limitation. Still others wait until near the expiration of the 
statute of limitations simply because they are busy and have other, more immediate filing 
deadlines to meet. Attorneys can, however, only de lay filing suit for so long. This is because 
all states have statutes of limitations during which time claims must be filed. Such statutes require that claims be filed within 2–4 year s (depending upon the state) after the claimant 
discovers an injury resulting from a professional service. 
• Added Difficulties for the Defense.  Finally, delay tactics are used because as time elapses, 
witnesses may no longer remember details clearly . In addition, professionals tend to purge 
their older client files. Such factors make it more difficult to defend against allegations of 
professional negligence. 
The IBNR Problem: Claims-Made versus Occurrence Reserving  
Claims that are “incurred but not reported” (IBNR ) are those which have actually occurred but have 
not yet been reported to an insurer.  (The sum of IBNR losses plus incurred losses provide an estimate of the insurer’s eventual liabiliti es for losses during a given period.) The following example illustrates 
how IBNR claims make it difficult to evaluate an  insurer’s ultimate dollar liability under a book of 
business written on an occurrence basis. 
This study illustrates the difference between clai m reserving, when one book of PL/EL business is 
written on an occurrence basis and the other is written on a claims-made basis.  
Occurrence Book of Business 
Assume that a professional liability underwriter’ s book of business consists of 1,000 occurrence 
policies, all having a January 1, 2006 to January 1,  2007 term. On January 1, 2007 (when the policies 
have expired), 15 claims under these policies have be en reported to the insurer. At that point, the 
underwriter can set reserves for each of these claims and will, at that juncture, attempt to determine 
pricing for the policies that renew on January 1,  2007. However, given the known time lag between 
wrongful acts and the eventual making and reporti ng of claims, the 15 claims reported thus far 
represent perhaps only one-quarter to one-third of all the claims that will ultimately be made in 
conjunction with wrongful acts occurring during the January 1, 2006/2007 policy period. Therefore, 
on January 1, 2007, the underwriter has only a vague notion of what his actual loss experience for the 
January 1, 2006/2007 policy year will ultimately be . This is because only a fraction of the claims 
from that policy period have even been made, t hus making it difficult to set reserves for what may—
or may not be—an additional 20 to 30 claims. Thes e estimated 20 to 30 claims constitute the IBNR 
problem.  
Claims-Made Book of Business 
Contrast this situation with a book of business written under a book of claims-made policies, for the 
same January 1, 2006 to January 1, 2007 policy te rm. On January 1, 2007, the underwriter could set 
up a reserve for these 15 claims that would apply to the January 1, 2006/2007 policy year. Unlike the occurrence underwriter in the preceding paragraph, the claims-made underwriter would know about most of the claims applying to the recently-expired January 1, 2006/2007 policy period and would 
therefore be in a better position to set reserves for the 15 claims. In effect, on January 1, 2007, he 
would know about perhaps 80 to 90 percent of the clai ms that will eventually apply to the just-expired 
policy period. He or she could add an additional two to five claims for those made very late in the 
policy period, (or during 30 or 60 day post-policy reporting windows), which have not yet been 
reported to the insurer. Yet, under these conditio ns, pricing the January 1, 2007/2008 book of Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
56 business will be done with a much greater degree of precision and confidence than for occurrence 
policies, because almost all of the known claims from the preceding policy year can be reserved on a 
fairly accurate basis.  
The Bottom Line: Liabilities Easier To  Estimate under Claims-Made Books of 
Business 
This case study illustrates the problem of IBNR lo sses that is associated with offering occurrence 
policies. Despite the fact that the occurrence polic ies have expired, numerous claims from the just-
expired 1/1/06/2007 policy year could still be made against insureds and reported to the insurer many years after expiration of the policies that expired on January 1, 2007. As already noted, this is 
especially common in professional liability/ex ecutive liability insurance lines, which are 
characterized by a long-tail exposure. Howe ver, as the case study illustrated, a book of business 
written on a claims-made basis almost completely eliminates this problem. 
The Inflation Problem 
Inflation makes it difficult for insurers to accurately estimate their ultimate dollar liabilities on claims that require many years to close. Although inflati on has averaged about 3.5 to 4 percent over the past 
30 years, it has been much higher/lower during a number of individual years within this time frame. Such variability therefore lessens the accuracy with  which inflation can be estimated in any given 
year. When this difficulty in estimating inflation combines with the inherent time lags in receiving 
and settling professional/executive liability claims (i.e ., the IBNR problem), the effects of inflation 
are even more pronounced under occurrence books of  business than under those written on a claims-
made basis.  
Prejudgment Interest 
Prejudgment interest refers to monies that accrue if the amount of a claimant’s damages had been 
allowed to accumulate interest from the moment she suffered damage from the professional’s 
conduct, but prior to an initial judgment or verdict against the professional.  
Post-judgment Interest 
This refers to interest that accrues following the rendering of a judgment but before that judgment is 
actually paid to the claimant. In the event that the defendant-professional decides to appeal a judgment, post-judgment interest continues to accrue  until a final judgment is reached (i.e., until such 
time as the judgment is either reversed on appeal or upheld on appeal).  
Inflation, in the realm of professional/executive liab ility underwriting, refers to the following three 
elements, all of which increase settlement levels over time:  
• a decline in purchasing power 
• changes in public attitudes  
• judicial and legislative trends  
The following sections illustrate why inflation ma kes it more difficult to evaluate an insurer’s 
ultimate dollar liability under a book of business writte n on an occurrence basis, compared to a book 
written on a claims-made basis.  Chapter 9—The Rationale for Claims-Made Insurance 
57 A Decline in the Purchasing Power over Time 
The fact that the dollar buys more today than it will 10 or 20 years hence exerts upward pressure on 
claim settlement levels with the passage of time. In other words, the inju ry requiring $100,000 of 
medical treatment in 2005 will ultimately be settled for a much greater sum 10 years later, given the 
fact that $100,000 will not, in the year 2015, provide  the same amount of treatment as it did in 2005. 
Changes in Public Attitudes 
These changes may manifest themselves in markedly in creased jury awards and/or inflated notions on 
the part of claimants and their attorneys as to the value of claims against professionals. Public 
attitudes, as reflected in jury award levels, also a ffect settlement levels. This has been referred to as 
“social inflation.” In recent decades, individuals’ con cepts of fault, coupled with the standards of care 
that the public believes they are owed by professi onals and corporate executives, appear to have 
markedly increased the general level of jury aw ards in personal injury and class action claims 
involving corporate securities. These attitudes are also reflected in terms of higher claim frequency. 
Judicial and Legislative Trends 
Such factors also impact the general level of liab ility claim settlement levels  against professionals. As 
an example, the joint and several liability doctrine,  which is a product of common (i.e., judicially-
created) law, has significantly increased liability claim payment levels.  
• Joint and Several Liability. The joint and several doctrine comes into play when multiple 
defendants are held jointly responsible for cau sing an injury. Under this doctrine, their 
liability for payment of damages can be a pportioned in any manner—irrespective of the 
degree of fault. For example, assume an uninsured  motorist and a truck driver employed by a 
Fortune 500 company, are concurrently negligen t in causing an automobile accident. Even if 
their degrees of fault are 90 percent and 10 per cent, respectively, the Fortune 500 company, 
given its greater financial resources, could, unde r the doctrine of joint and several liability, be 
held legally responsible for paying the entire amount of any judgment rendered, irrespective 
of the organization’s relatively small (i.e., 10 percent) degree of fault in causing the injury. 
This often happens when one of negligent par ties that caused the accident is or becomes 
insolvent.  
• Multiple Claims from the Same Act. Laws that permit separate claims by both injured 
minor claimants and by their parents, provide an  example of legislative trends that influence 
the levels of liability claim settlements. Such su its can be separated by many years because in 
a number of states, the statute of limitations in personal injury cases brought by minors does not begin to run until the minor reaches major ity. Thus, a professional can sometimes be sued 
twice for the same wrongful act (i.e., first by an injured minor’s parents and later by the minor when he or she reaches the age of 21).

58 IBNR Compounds the Inflation Problem 
It should be evident that the inflation problem compounds the IBNR problem. For example, as 
already noted, at the expiration of a book of occurre nce policies, an underwriter can set reserves for 
only 20 to 30 percent of all expected claims. In addition, the underwriter can only make a rough 
estimate of the extent to which inflation will ultim ately affect the final settlement levels of these 
IBNR claims—because such claims may not be reported for a number of years. Although both 
occurrence and claims-made underwriters must gra pple with the inflation problem on their “known” 
claims, the claims-made underwriter need not worry about the inflation factor as respects IBNR losses because, unlike the occurrence unde rwriter, he or she has none. 
Reporting Time Lags + IBNR + Inflation: Factors Making it Difficult To Price 
Coverage 
Let us return briefly to the IBNR case study earlier in this chapter. On January 1, 2011, when most of the claims under the January 1, 2006/2007 occurre nce policy period will probably have been reported 
to the insurer, the occurrence underwriter will finally have an accurate concept of what his or her ultimate liabilities will be. However, during the preceding 5 years, the underwriter has been forced to price his or her books of business for the January  1, 2007/2008; January 1, 2008/2009; January 1, 
2009/2010; and January 1, 2010/2011 terms on the basis of only a rough estimate of the actual dollar 
loss levels experienced during the January 1, 2006/2 007 period. Therefore, the combined effects of 
IBNR claims, coupled with inflationary forces th roughout this 5-year time span, will have made it 
almost impossible to do little more than guess when trying to accurately price coverage in succeeding 
policies. 
Summary 
Claims-made policies overcome many of the problems caused by claim reporting time lags, the IBNR 
factor, and the inflation factor discussed in the preceding pages. Claims-made forms almost 
completely solve the difficulties posed by claim repor ting lags and, in the process, also remove the 
threat posed by IBNR claims. Although the infla tion factor is still operative as respects known claims, 
a book of business written on a claims-made basis is well-protected from the effects of inflation upon 
unknown claims—because there are usually only a re latively small number. And because they need 
not be overly concerned about u nknown claims, insurers writing clai ms-made policies are in a much 
better position to accurately project loss levels on their current books of business and ultimately develop more accurate rates on future business, than if they wrote coverage on an occurrence basis. 
In contrast, professional liability insurance written on an occurrence basis has an inherent tendency to 
be underpriced, given the time lag, IBNR, and inflationary factors discussed above. In the final 
analysis, underpricing destabilizes the professional liability insurance market, a condition that is 
ultimately to the detriment of all professionals seeking insurance coverage. Clearly, claims-made policies successfully overcome many of the problems caused by these factors, as witnessed by (with a few exceptions, notably medical malpractice), th e relative stability of the professional liability 
insurance market during the past 20 years. 
Ease in Determining the Responsible Insurer 
The second major advantage of claims-made polic ies is the improved ability to determine the 
responsible insurer for any given loss. Historically , the insurance industry has used the date of the 
injury as the triggering event for the applicati on of liability coverage.58This is known as an Chapter 9—The Rationale for Claims-Made Insurance 
59 occurrence coverage trigger, whereb y the policy in effect at the time a loss or damage occurs must 
respond to any claim. 
The occurrence coverage trigger works well in many instances. Two prime examples are commercial 
auto policies and property insurance policies—both i nvolve loss situations in which the date of the 
accident is usually quickly followed by the reporting of a claim. This makes it easy to ascertain the 
appropriate insurer.  
However, in a number of situations, it is difficult to determine which insurer, in a series of insurers is 
responsible for a claim. Specifically, if an injury or claim develops from a series of wrongful acts 
taking place over a long period of time, it is difficult to assign responsibility to a single policy if the 
applicable policies during this period have all been written with occurrence coverage triggers. 
Complications from Occurre nce Triggers: A Case Study 
The following example illustrates the problem of assessing insurer responsibility under an occurrence 
coverage trigger. Imagine that, beginning on January 1, 2006 and continuing for nearly 6 years (until 
December 1, 2011), an accounting firm performed a nnual audits of the XYZ Company. On December 
15, 2011, XYZ declares bankruptcy. On December 31,  2011, the accounting firm receives a claim by 
a number of persons (i.e., in a class action suit)  who purchased XYZ stock during the preceding 6 
years. The claimants allege that the accounting firm’s audits within that time failed to reveal the true 
financial condition of XYZ and that, throughout th is period, XYZ had been in severe financial 
difficulty. During this time, the accounting firm was insured by occurrence policies with three 
different insurers. Under this scenario, it would be  almost impossible to assign responsibility for the 
claim to a single insurer. On the other hand, had the policies been written with claims-made coverage 
triggers, the insurer covering the accounting firm at the time the claim was made (December 31, 
2011) would be the one responsible. 
However, in the absence of claims-made coverage in such situations, courts tend to decide that the 
insured is entitled to the broadest possible scope of  coverage. For example, assume the three insurers 
during the January 1, 2006–2012 time period were as follows. 
Insurer Policy Period(s)  Policy Limit 
A January 1, 2006/2007 
January 1, 2007/2008 $500,000 $750,000 
B January 1, 2008/2009 
January 1, 2009/2010 $750,000 $1 million 
C January 1, 2010/2011 
January 1, 2011/2012 $2 million $2 million Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
60 “Stacking” of Limits 
Based on this situation, the wrongful acts (i.e., the misstatement of XYZ’s financial condition in 
annual audits conducted from 2006 to 2011) may reasonably be consider ed by a court to have taken 
place in each of the 6 policy years during which occu rrence coverage was in force. Therefore, the 
accounting firm could make an excellent case that the limit available to pay the claim should be the total of the limits provided by all six policies indicated above, or $7 million. 
This rationale is known as “stacking of limits,” a result that was never intended by the insurance 
industry in such situations. On the other hand, the use of claims-made coverage  triggers avoids this 
stacking of limits problem, so in the above exam ple (assuming all of the policies had been written 
with claims-made coverage triggers), Insure r C’s $2 million policy limit would be the only one 
available to pay the claims because that was the one in force at the time the accounting firm was sued. 
Despite the clear-cut determination of coverage in  the preceding paragraph, it should be pointed out 
that unless the retroactive date of C’s policy was Jan uary 1, 2006 (or earlier), problems would arise in 
determining the extent to which C is responsible fo r the claim, given that some of the wrongful acts 
producing the claim probably took place prior to the time C insured the accounting firm. (In effect, 
unless C provided prior acts coverage back to January 1, 2006, C would not be responsible for the 
entire claim.) 
Despite such complications, the controversies in de termining coverage are usually a great deal less 
contentious under claims-made than under occurrence policies. 
Chapter 9 Review Questions  
1. One of the problems with occurrence policies fro m the standpoint of an insurer is that they : 
a. cover claims made during the policy period for occurrences prior to the policy period. 
b. cover claims made for a limited period after the policy expires for occurrences during the 
policy period. 
c. cover claims made long after the policy expir es for events that occurred during the policy 
period. 
d. cover only claims made prior to the policy’s expiration. 
2. In 2010, real estate broker Carla Shark makes a mistake in completing her friend Squatter’s real estate purchase transaction. Specifically, Carla gives Squatter a defective deed to the property he has purchased. Although Squatter is aware that the deed contains an error, he takes possession of the property regardless and does not make a claim against Shark. However, when Squatter attempts to sell the pr operty in 2020, the error in the deed makes it 
impossible to sell the property. As a result, he sues Carla. Likely reasons for the delay include 
all of the following, except:  
a. Shark had been very helpful and friendly in every other aspect of the transaction. 
b. Squatter wanted immediate redress for the wrong that had been done to him.  
c. Squatter was not immediately aware how severe the problem was. 
d. Squatter was not sure whether the “little probl em” was the fault of Shark, Squatter, or 
some other party. Chapter 9—The Rationale for Claims-Made Insurance 
61 3. Ignoring loss adjustment expenses, an insurer’s ultimate dollar liability for claims covered by 
a book of professional liability insurance policies is: 
a. incurred losses minus IBNR losses. 
b. incurred losses plus IBNR losses.  
c. paid losses minus IBNR losses. 
d. paid losses plus IBNR losses. 
4. As compared with occurrence policies, a book of claims-made professional liability policies: 
a. almost completely eliminates the long-tail. 
b. curls the long tail.  
c. wags the same long-tail. 
d. stretches the long-tail. 
5. Alex the architect makes an error in a blue print in 2000. His error causes a building to 
collapse in 2010. The claims that resulted from the collapse are not settled until 2020. Which 
of the following factors are likely to have an effect on the amounts for which the claims were 
eventually settled? 
a. Decrease in the value of the dollar. 
b. The premium levels for architects & engineers liability insurance.  
c. The number of insurers writing professional liability insurance. 
d. Licensing standards for architects. 
6. The effect of inflation on claims under o ccurrence and claims-mad e liability policies: 
a. is greater for claims-made policies, because more claims are not known until some future 
date. 
b. is greater for occurrence policies, because mo re claims are not known until some future 
date.  
c. is identical, as both are affected by the same factors. 
d. is unaffected by IBNR claims.

62 Answers to Chapter 9 Review Questions 
1. c. Claims applying to the policy period may be made years later. 
2. b. Delaying the claim also delays any redress. 
3. b. The sum of IBNR losses plus incurred losses provide an estimate of the insurer’s eventual 
liabilities for losses during a given period. 
4. a. A book of business written on a claims-made basis almost completely eliminates the long-tail 
problem. 
5. a. The dollar’s purchasing power has declined—you need more dollars now than in the past to buy or 
offer the same services. So if a claimant’s inco me loss was $100,000 in 2010 when his injury 
occurred, his income for the same period of time would be much larger when the claim was settled in 2020. 
6. b. Many claims against occurrence policies are in curred during the policy period but reported much 
later.

insureds. Chapter 10 discusses these advantages and disadvantages.

The Insurer’s Perspective: Pros 
As noted previously, the two major advantages of claims-made policies from the insurer’s standpoint 
are the greater ease with which losses can be projected and the avoidance of disputes among a series of insurers regarding liability for a given claim (and consequential stacked policy limits). 
Additionally, insurers derive two other signifi cant benefits from policies written on a claims-made 
basis, as discussed below. 
 Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
64 Marketing 
From a sales standpoint, an insurer can offer an im mature claims-made policy at rates that are much 
lower than an occurrence policy. Assuming an insured is changing from an occurrence to a claims-
made policy or is just beginning a professional prac tice, no coverage gap would be produced by the 
claims-made policy. Claims-made coverage for such persons will be substantia lly less expensive than 
a policy written on an occurrence basis. This concept is illustrated in Exhibit 10.2. 
 
EXHIBIT 10.2 
OCCURRENCE TO CLAIMS-MADE POLICY CHANGES CAUSE NO COVERAGE 
GAPS  
Retention of Insureds 
As noted in Exhibit 10.1, insureds face a number of financial disincentives when changing from one claims-made insurer to another. Either it will be necessary to pay two premiums (e.g., one for ERP 
coverage and one for the new policy) or a “loaded”  premium will be charged by a replacement insurer 
who offers prior acts coverage. It should be mentione d, however, that insureds do not always pay a 
higher premium for a replacement policy covering prior acts if the expired/canceled policy was 
already priced at a fully mature claims-made rate. A “fully mature” claims made rate refers to the rate applied to a claims-made policy that covers at least 5 years of prior acts. Assume a lawyer had 5 years of coverage with insurer A from January 1, 2010 to  January 1, 2015. Insurer B writes a policy with a 
Chapter 10—Advantages and Disadva ntages of Claims-Made Forms 
65 1-year term from January 1, 2015 to January 1, 2016  that includes prior acts coverage back to January 
1, 2010. In this instance, the attorney will likel y be charged a “fully mature” claims-made rate.  
A less expensive but equally unpala table alternative is to secure a replacement policy that does not 
cover prior acts, and to not purchase the ERP in th e expiring or canceled policy. The problem with 
this course of action is that there would be no coverage for wrongful acts that took place during the 
prior policy which are not reported until the new policy’s term. 
As indicated by the preceding paragraphs, most cha nges of insurers involve either additional premium 
costs or exposure to claims from potential covera ge gaps (and sometimes both). Thus, professionals 
must have meaningful reasons for making such a switch. Given these disincentives to change 
insurers, underwriters are better able to retain profitable accounts and thereby improve the quality of 
their books of business. 
This situation may, however, also prove to be  an advantage for insureds. Because claims-made 
coverage makes price shopping more difficult, since the early 1990s it appears to have played some 
role in stabilizing the entire market, leveling rates, and ultimately avoiding the availability crises that 
plagued professional/executive liability coverage  lines in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s—time 
frames when occurrence-triggered policies were more common. 
The Insurer’s Perspective: Cons 
Although claims-made policies are largely favorable to  the interests of insurers, they contain several 
drawbacks, which are discussed below. 
Public Relations Problems  
However advantageous a claims-made coverage trigger is from an underwriting standpoint, the 
general public continues to find something intuitivel y wrong with the concept. Many insureds feel 
that if coverage is in force at the time a wrongful act takes place, protection should be afforded, irrespective of when a claim is  ultimately made. Although the principles underlying claims-made 
insurance are becoming better understood and in creasingly accepted by insureds, there is, and 
probably always will be, some resistance to the way the forms operate. Among other effects, this 
resistance has caused a number of lawsuits concerning claims-made policy provisions. 
Such attitudes obligate insurers to continually assist agents and brokers in d ealing with consumers of 
claims-made forms. Full disclosure and understandable explanations must be made to consumers by 
agents because it is the producer, rather than the underwriter, whose contacts serve as the true focal 
point in educating buyers. Although there have been a number of legal cha llenges to claims-made policy provisions, public 
relations problems are, in fact, easing for a numbe r of reasons. First, professional/executive liability 
insurance consumers are becoming more familiar with the operation of the claims-made form. 
Second, consumers of claims-made forms who are also professionals and business executives are 
more sophisticated than the typical consumer of personal lines insurance. This is especially true 
considering the substantial ou tlays required of professionals who purchase such coverage. 
 
 
 
 Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
66 Exposure to Claims from a Number of Years when Writing Prior Acts Coverage 
Unlike an occurrence policy that covers damage wh ich has been caused by wrongful acts taking place 
in a single year, a claims-made policy covering prior acts can potentially be called on to pay claims 
that have resulted from wrongful acts performed during multiple years. Therefore, underwriters 
providing prior acts coverage must be extremely thorough in evaluating any professional liability risk. Not only must the assessment examine the nature and extent of the exposure on a prospective basis, but the underwriter must also analyze the exposure in  terms of the retrospective exposure to loss. In 
this respect, a claims-made policy form places a heavier burden on an underwriter than does an 
occurrence policy, because the underwriter must view the risk from two different perspectives rather 
than only one. 
The Insured’s Perspective: Pros 
Insurance buyers have difficulties in understanding that there are, in fact, some advantages inherent in 
a claims-made insurance policy form. These advantages are discussed below. These pros include: 
• lower premium 
• a stable market for coverage 
• availability of prior acts coverage 
• a lower risk of insurer insolvency 
• the ability to update limits, commensurate with exposures that increase over the years 
Lower Premium 
Initially, at least, an immature claims-made polic y will cost significantly less than a new occurrence 
policy. This can be a meaningful advantage for a professional who is just beginning a practice and 
often does not have a great deal of funds available to pay insurance premiums or for a start-up 
corporation that buys D&O coverage for the first time. (Admittedly, however, a mature claims-made 
policy would not cost substantially less than a comparable occurrence policy, so that the cost 
differential eventually ceases.) 
Stable Market for Coverage 
As noted in the section on insurer advantages, the fact that insureds will think twice before switching 
insurers should, in theory, have the effect of stabilizing the professional/executive liability insurance 
market. The absence of price shopping should make it easier to retain insureds, thereby preventing the “buying” of accounts and writing coverage at inade quate rates. Adequate pr icing should ultimately 
stabilize the professional/executive lia bility insurance market, thereby making coverage more readily 
available. 
This argument is still not without holes, however. Claims-made policies have been the rule in 
professional liability lines for at least 40 years. Yet,  during this time, especially in the 1970s and 
1980s, the industry has had availability problems. Th is weakens the contention that a claims-made 
form promotes a completely stable and availa ble market for professional liability coverages. 
Nevertheless, the 1990s and 2000s (except with respect to medical malpractice coverage in the mid-
2000s) have not yet produced sim ilar availability problems.  Chapter 10—Advantages and Disadvantages of Claims-Made Forms 
67 Coverage for Prior Acts 
It is not uncommon for a professional to begin and continue his or her practice for several years 
before purchasing professional liability insurance coverage. Claims-made policy forms may be 
advantageous for such persons, because they can provide coverage for wrongful acts that were 
committed before the professional had purchased insurance (assuming such policies contain a 
retroactive date concurrent with the inception of the professional’s practice). This concept is 
illustrated in Exhibit 10.3.   
EXHIBIT 10.3 
CLAIMS-MADE COVERAGE FOR PRIOR ACTS  
 The fact that the wrongful act in Exhibit 10.3 took  place prior to the inception of the claims-made 
insurer’s policy term is irrelevant since the 2008/2 009 policy contained a January 1, 2006 retroactive 
date. Thus, the claims-made policy, which is writte n to cover prior acts (note the January 1, 2006 
retroactive date), would provide c overage under those circumstances. 
Admittedly, not all underwriters will be agreeable  to providing a retroactive date on a professional’s 
first policy that is concurrent with the date on whic h he or she first began practicing. Moral hazard is 
a potential problem under these circumstances, becaus e the professional’s sudd en desire to purchase 
coverage for the first time may indicate that he or  she intends to report a claim under the new policy. 
However, as a condition of purchasing prior acts covera ge, an insured must warrant that he or she 
knows of no circumstances which could reasonably be expected to give rise to claims in the future, 
As a result, and in consideration of the additional premium that must be paid for prior acts coverage, 
underwriters will often agree to provide it. 
Note that the lack of coverage for prior acts is  a corresponding disadvantage of occurrence policies. 
Professionals who do not purchase insurance at the inception of their practice and then obtain an 
occurrence policy will have no coverage for acts performed prior to the first occurrence policy.  
Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
68 Insurer Solvency 
The solvency factor is especially important in a long-tailed line, such as professional liability, in 
which an apparently solid insurer in year 1 may be in  a completely different financial situation in year 
10, when it will finally be called on to pay a claim.  As already explained, this time lag between the 
inception of a policy and the actual payment of a claim is somewhat reduced with a claims-made 
policy, compared to an occurrence form. Ultimate ly, this means that professional/executive liability 
insurers will have a better handle on their claim lia bilities which should improve the overall solvency 
of the industry. 
Solvency Issues: Risk Retention Groups and Captives 
Insurer solvency is even more critical given t oday’s trend toward “private” insurance coverage 
arrangements. More specifically, the national movement to risk retention groups, captives, and similar 
pooling/alternative funding arrangements for prof essional liability lines has produced a number of 
fledgling and financially untested risk-bearing entities. In theory, claims-made policies should 
stabilize their underwriting results and, in the process, reduce insolvencies. 
Insureds’ Response to Insurer Financial Condition 
Also related to the insurer solvency issue is the ability of insureds to  react quickly to situations where 
a claims-made insurer is having financial problems,  compared to how quickly insureds can react 
when such difficulties affect an o ccurrence insurer. For instance, assume  that at the end of a January 
1, 2006/2007 claims-made policy term with Insurer A, an insured is notified that A is insolvent. To close the potential coverage gap created by this situ ation (i.e., no coverage for claims from acts that 
took place January 1, 2006 to January 1, 2007 that are made after January 1, 2007), the insured can 
purchase a replacement policy for the January 1, 2007/2008 term that covers prior acts back to 
January 1, 2006. On the other hand, if the insure d’s January 1, 2006/2007 policy were written on an 
occurrence basis (and he or she replaced it with a January 1, 2007/2008 occurrence policy), he or she 
would have a permanent coverage gap as respects claims produced by acts committed from January 1, 
2006 to January 1, 2007. 
Appropriate Limits 
Under an occurrence form, an insured runs the risk that the policy limit in effect at the time a claim is 
actually settled may be woefully inadequate, given th e inflation factor discussed earlier. For example, 
imagine that a physician operates on a 6-year-old ch ild in 1995. The negligent effects of the operation 
are not discovered until 15 years later in 2010 when th e patient, now an adult, makes a claim. Assume 
that a judgment is rendered 5 years after the claim is  made. When the claim is finally closed in 2015, 
the physician’s $500,000 occurrence policy limit purchased in 1995 may not be sufficient to pay a judgment rendered 2 decades later. However, had the physician been covered by a series of claims-
made forms during this time, he or she would have  had the opportunity to increase his or her policy 
limits throughout this period to keep pace with infl ation. Undoubtedly, his limit of coverage in 2010 
(under a claims-made policy) would have been higher than the $500,000 limit that he carried under the 1995 occurrence policy. 
 
 
  Chapter 10—Advantages and Disadva ntages of Claims-Made Forms 
69 The Insured’s Perspective: Cons 
As noted earlier, claims-made insurance presents several potential problems for insureds. These are 
discussed briefly in the following pages. These cons include: 
• lack of continuity assurance 
• difficulty in changing insurers  
• the need to maintain coverage after retirement 
Lack of Continuity Assurance 
There are three situations that can give rise to coverage gaps when claims-made insurance is involved: (1) retroactive date advancement, (2 ) nonrenewal/cancellation, and (3) change to 
occurrence insurance. Each of these situations  were examined in detail in Chapter 7. 
Difficulty in Changing Insurers 
Because it is usually difficult to change insurers  once an insured is covered under a claims-made 
form, a reasonable argument can be made that the in herent nature of claims-made insurance inhibits 
an insured’s freedom of choice in selecting lower cost insurance coverage alternatives (such as 
captives or lower-priced policies offered by other insurers), or if, for example, the insured seeks coverage with a different insurer to obtain better claims handling service.  
Coverage Needed after Retirement 
If an insured has purchased claims-made policies th roughout the term of his professional practice, it 
will be necessary to continue buying coverage for claims that may not be made until after he or she 
concludes that practice. Typically, this is handled  by runoff endorsements, discussed in Chapter 8. 
Yet to many consumers, this seems intuitively unfair. Why? 
Conversely, if a professional had been covered by a series of occurrence forms, there is generally no 
need to continue purchasing coverage once he or sh e ceases to practice. This concept is illustrated in 
Exhibit 10.4. 
 
 
    
 
     Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
70 EXHIBIT 10.4 
POST RETIREMENT COVERAGE  
 
As shown in Exhibit 10.4, there will be no cove rage for any claims made after the 2008/2009 policy 
expires, despite the fact that they were the r esult of acts taking place before the insured retired on 
January 1, 2009. Thus, the claim noted in the exhibit would not be covered unless the professional 
had purchased an extended reporting endorsement after the termination of his or her January 1, 2008/2009 policy. Conversely, had all the policies in Exhibit 10.4 been written on an occurrence basis, any claims resulting from acts taking place between January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2009 would be covered, regardless of when they were made. 
Chapter 10 Review Questions  
1. From an insurance company’s perspective, th e advantages of using claims-made policy forms 
rather than occurren ce policy forms include: 
a. coverage for prior acts. 
b. more accurate loss projection. 
c. multi-year claim exposures. 
d. stacked limits.

71 2. John Lemon had three professional liability polici es covering these dates: Policy A—June 1, 
2010–June 1, 2011; Policy B—June 1, 2011–Jun e 1, 2012; and Policy C—June 1, 2012–June 
1, 2013. Policies A and B were occurrence policies; Policy C is a claims-made policy with a 
retroactive date of June 1, 2012. On Septem ber 11, 2012 a claim was made against Lemon 
alleging that a wrongful act occurred on Septem ber 11, 2010. Based on this information, it 
appears that: 
a. coverage applies under Policy A. 
b. coverage applies under Policy B.  
c. coverage applies under Policy C. 
d. coverage applies under Policies A, B, and C. 
3. When claims-made professional or executive liability insurance is involved, the financial 
disincentives involved in changing from one insurer to the next have all of the following effects, except : 
a. Insureds find price shopping more difficult. 
b. The general public intuitively favors prefers the claims-made approach.  
c. The professional/executive liabilit y insurance market has beco me more stable because it 
is costly for insureds to change insurers. 
d. Underwriters are better able to retain profita ble accounts because it is costly for insureds 
to change insurers. 
4. In the beginning phase of her creative accounting practice, Janice has limited funds available for insurance. In comparing claims-made with  occurrence professional liability policies for a 
person in her situation, she will probably discover that: 
a. a first-time occurrence policy costs signifi cantly less than a new claims-made policy.  
b. after 5 years, occurrence coverage will cost significantly less than claims-made coverage, 
assuming she continues to renew her initia l claims-made or occurrence policy. 
c. a first-time claims-made policy costs significantly less than a new occurrence policy 
d. claims-made coverage costs more the first year than an occurrence policy when she 
considers the added cost of the ERP coverage.

72 5. Giraffe Insurance Company writes claims-made professional liability policies, rather than 
occurrence policies, under the theory that the use of claims-made policies improves its chances of remaining solvent and able to me et future claims. All of the following 
assumptions support Giraffe’s theory, except: 
a. Insurers have a better handle on their clai ms liabilities with claims-made insurance 
compared to occurrence policies.  
b. Professional liability is a long-tailed line of insurance which is better suited to claims-made, rather than occurrence policy forms. 
c. The average time period between policy incep tion and the actual payment of claims is 
shorter with claims-made policies than with occurrence policies, which makes it easier to determine ultimate claim liabilities. 
d. Claims-made premiums are much higher, especially for immature policies. 
6. A plastic surgeon opened her practice on 1/1/90 . Her professional liability limits since that 
time were: $100,000 from 1/1/1990–95 under Policy A, $250,000 from 1/1/95–2000 under 
Policy B, $500,000 from 1/1/2000–05 under  policy C, and $1 million from 1/1/2005–10 
under Policy D. All of the policies are written without retroactive dates. In 2008, a claim is 
made against the surgeon, alleging that in 1990, her surgical error caused a patient to develop 
a tumor, which eventually resu lted in his death in 2007. Assuming previous claims have not 
reduced the limits available, the doctor has coverage for this claim in the amount of: 
a. $100,000 because this was the limit in effect  at the time of the wrongful act.  
b. $1,000,000 because this was the limit in effect at the time the claim was made. 
c. $1,100,000 because the limit that applies is th e total available under Policies A , the limit 
in effect at the time of the wrongful act and D,  the limit in effect at the time the claim was 
made. 
d. $1,850,000 because the limit that applies is the total available under Policies, A, B, C, 
and D, the total of all policies in effect from  the time of the wrongful act to the time the 
claim was made. 
7. Before retiring on June 1, 2013 , Sam Iam had three professional liability policies with claims-
made triggers covering these dates: Policy A—J une 1, 2010–June 1, 2011; Policy B—June 1, 
2011–June 1, 2012; and Policy C—June 1, 20 12–June 1, 2013. Sam did not renew Policy C 
or do anything else to continue his cove rage, because he was no longer pursuing any 
professional activities. On September 11, 2013 a claim is made against Sam alleging that a 
covered type of error or omission occurred on September 11, 2010. Sam reported the claim to 
his three previous insurers on December 15, 2013. Based on this information, it appears that: 
a. coverage applies under Policy A.  
b. coverage applies under Policy B. 
c. coverage applies under Policy C. 
d. no coverage applies under any of the poli cies because no coverage was in force on 
September 11, 2013, the date on which the claim was made against Sam.

75 Chapter 11 
How Occurrence Coverage Triggers Operate 
Chapter 11 defines the term “occurrence coverage  trigger,” explains how occurrence coverage 
triggers function in claim situations, and discu sses the advantages and disadvantages they present for 
both insureds and insurers. 
The majority of professional liability policies are wr itten with a claims-made coverage trigger. There 
are, however, a few coverage lines, most notably media liability, police professional liability, medical 
professional, and hospital professional liability, that are occasionally offered on an occurrence basis.  
There are two reasons for this. First, and especially with respect to media and police liability, there is 
generally a relatively shorter time lag between an  alleged wrongful act and the actual making of a 
claim—compared to other types of professionals. For example, within days after a magazine or newspaper prints what a claimant considers to be libelous material, an immediate retraction is usually 
demanded. Lawsuits are typically filed within weeks, rather than months or years, after such conduct by a media insured. The same is true as respects most  police “incidents” in which false arrest and/or 
excessive force is alleged. Accordingly, insurers  in these lines sometimes provide coverage on an 
occurrence form. Second, and especially as respec ts medical and hospital professional liability, 
insurers will occasionally offer to write occurren ce-based coverage for competitive reasons, most 
often in hopes of encouraging insureds to switch from their current claims-made insurer to their own 
occurrence policy form. For these reasons, it is necessary to discuss the nature of occurrence coverage triggers; how they apply, as well as how they  differ from claims-made coverage triggers. 
What is an Occurrence Coverage Trigger?  
An occurrence coverage trigger in a professional lia bility policy obligates an insurer to defend and/or 
pay a claim if the claim arises from a wrongful act that took place during the period in which the policy was effective. Unlike a claims-made policy,  the date on which the claim is actually made 
against the insured or reported to the insurer is irrelevant from the standpoint of triggering coverage. 
Rather, the terms and conditions of the policy that were in effect at the time the wrongful act took 
place are the ones that apply. This is in contrast  to claims-made coverage, in which the terms and 
conditions of the policy in force at the time the claim is made, are the ones that apply. 
Occurrence Trigger Application 
An example demonstrates how an occurrence coverage trigger functions in a claim situation. Assume 
an insured has a professional liability policy written on an occurrence basis with a term of January 1, 
2005 to January 1, 2006. If the insured commits a wrongful act on July 1, 2005, but the resulting Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
76 claim is not made until July 1, 2010, the claim w ould be covered by the 2005/2006 policy, regardless 
of the 5-year lag between the time the wrongful act was committed and the date on which the claim 
was made. In other words, the date on which the clai m is actually made is irrelevant to the issue of 
determining coverage. The date on which the wrongful act occurred—regardless of the date the 
damage from that wrongful act took place or was discovered—is the only date that controls the 
trigger of coverage. Exhibit 11.1 provides an illu stration of how an occurrence coverage trigger 
operates.

77 Advantages and Disadvantages of Occurrence Policies  
There are a number of pros and cons associated with professional liability policies written on an 
occurrence basis. These advantages and disadvantag es are examined from both the standpoint of the 
insurer and the insured. They are noted in Exhi bit 11.2 and discussed in the pages that follow.

The Insurer’s Perspective: Pros 
Unlike claims-made policies, occurrence forms are not, on an overall basis, beneficial for insurers. 
They do, however, offer some advantages. 
• They are easier to underwrite. 
• They are perceived in a better light than claims-made policies. 
• They provide a competitive edge against other in surers that are offering a claims-made form. 
Underwriting Ease 
A less advanced degree of technical underwriting knowledge is needed to provide coverage on an 
occurrence basis than on a claims -made basis. This is because the following underwriting decisions 
are not required to be made when offering occurrence coverage:  
• the exclusion or coverage of prior acts,  
• the availability and pricing of  extended reporting periods,  
• the review and evaluation of information about exposures from years past (that might 
eventually give rise to claims), and  
• the more complex rating process involved with cl aims-made coverages (e .g., the need to use 
step rates when providing prior acts coverage) 
 
 
 Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
78 Public Relations 
The concept underlying occurrence policies, compared to coverage written on a claims-made basis, is 
easier for most insureds, as well as many insurance professionals, to fully gr asp. Moreover, insureds 
tend to be less familiar with claims-made polici es, despite the fact that they are not a new 
phenomenon in professional/executive liability insuran ce. Therefore, fewer problems are associated 
with offering occurrence as oppo sed to claims-made policies.  
The sheer volume of litigation involving the app lication of claims-made policy provisions (as 
compared to the litigation involving occurrence polic y provisions), provides evidence not only that 
occurrence forms are significantly different from claims-made policies but also that occurrence policies are easier to market and administer. 
Competitive Advantage 
An insurer’s willingness to write a professional liab ility policy on an occurrence basis might prove to 
be the decisive edge when competing against othe r insurers (that offer only claims-made coverage) 
for a valued account. All other things being relatively equal, most insureds would prefer to have their 
coverage written on an occurrence rather than on a claims-made basis. 
The Insurer’s Perspective: Cons 
As already discussed in this course, occurrence policy forms have caused considerable difficulties for insurers throughout the years, including problems in  pricing coverage and di fficulties in determining 
the insurer or insurers responsible for responding to a claim when a series of policies have been 
written. These problems are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
Long-Run Pricing Problems 
Again, as previously noted in this course, it is difficult to project ultimate liabilities on a book of 
occurrence business, given the time lag, incurred but not reported (IBNR), and inflation problems 
discussed earlier. In extreme cases, these have led to  under-pricing, financial instability, and eventual 
bankruptcy of a number of pr ofessional liability insurers. 
Problems in Determining the Responsible Insurer 
It is often difficult to ascertain which insurer, in  a series of insurers, is responsible for covering a 
claim because the act out of which the claim arose may have taken place over a period of time, spanning several different policies and/or insurers . When a wrongful act takes place over an extended 
period of time, the date of the wrongful act is almost impossible to pinpoint.  
Given this ambiguity, courts have taken the pos ition that the limits of all the insurers writing 
occurrence coverage during periods in which a series of wrongful acts took place, apply. This 
produces a stacking of limits situation, which marked ly expands the scope of coverage originally 
intended by professional liability underwriters. 
The Insured’s Perspective: Pros 
Occurrence coverage triggers provide a number of significant advantages for insureds, such as 
guaranteed continuity of coverage , availability of higher limits, and greater freedom of choice among 
coverage alternatives. These include: 
• Guaranteed continuity Chapter 11—How Occurrence C overage Triggers Operate 
79 • Availability of higher limits in multi-claim situations 
• Greater freedom of choice 
Guaranteed Continuity 
The most important advantage provided by an occurrence policy is that, when moving from an 
occurrence policy to either a claims-made policy or another occurrence policy, there are never any 
gaps or uncovered exposures from prior policy periods, as long as coverage is continuously renewed. This is demonstrated in Exhibit 11.3.  
EXHIBIT 11.3 
OCCURRENCE POLICIES ASSURE CONTINUITY  
Professional Liability Insu rance Coverage Triggers 
80 Availability of Higher Limits in Mu lti-claim/Multi-Year Situations 
In multiple claim situations made over a period of  years, occurrence polici es afford insureds the 
possibility of having larger total and individual c overage limits available. Exhibit 11.4 demonstrates 
the manner in which a series of occurrence policies, compared to an analogous sequence of claims-
made policies, provides both higher aggregat e as well as specific limits under multiple claim 
scenarios. 
 
EXHIBIT 11.4 
AGGREGATION OF POLICY LIMITS FOR BOTH CLAIMS-MADE AND 
OCCURRENCE FORMS  
 As Exhibit 11.4 demonstrates, if all three of the claims were reported after January 1, 2009, there 
would be coverage in the amount of $1 million for each of the resulting claims under a series of policies written with occurrence coverage triggers . Under claims-made forms, however, the total 
amount of coverage available for all three claims would only be $1 million (i.e., the $1 million limit 
Chapter 11—How Occurrence C overage Triggers Operate 
81 contained in the January 1, 2009/2010 policy) becau se all three claims were made in the same policy 
year. 
Under scenarios such as these, occurrence policies offer insureds the benefit of higher limits when 
multiple claims are made within a single policy year. 
Greater Freedom of Choice  
A strong case can be made that a claims-made cove rage trigger tends to keep the insured a “captive 
customer” to the insurer. As has been noted throughout this cour se, under claims-made coverage, it is 
difficult to change insurers. With occurrence policies, however, there is never any such problem 
because the substitution of a differe nt occurrence insurer creates no gaps in coverage and does not 
require purchasing either an extended reporting endor sement or prior acts coverage, as indicated in 
Exhibit 11.5.  
EXHIBIT 11.5 
REPLACING OCCURRENCE INSURERS CREATES NO COVERAGE GAPS  
The Insured’s Perspective: Cons 
There are four disadvantages inherent in occu rrence policies from the insured’s perspective. 
• The need to retain policies 
• Potentially inadequate limits 
• The lack of coverage for prior acts 
• Greater insurer solvency risk 
 
   
Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
82 Insurance Policy Retention 
A minor disadvantage of occurrence policies from the insured’s standpoint is the necessity of 
maintaining copies of all occurrence policies indefi nitely. This is because there is no limit as to how 
far in the future a claim can be made that arose from a wrongful act which took place during a 
previous policy period. For instance, a claim caused by a wrongful act occurring during a January 1, 
2006/2007 policy could conceivably be reported 20 y ears after the policy expired (on January 1, 
2027). Thus, an insured professional must keep copi es of all occurrence policies even after he has 
ceased practicing. 
Again, statutes of limitation, referred to earlier in th is course, mitigate this problem to some extent. 
However, such statutes do not begin to run when a cl aimant suffers an injury. Rather they begin to 
run when a claimant discovers an injury. In the case of a patient who has a sponge left in his stomach 
during surgery and doesn’t discover it until a number of years later, the statute of limitations will not begin to run for some time. This often delays the filing of a claim, thereby necessitating the retention 
of old policy forms.  
Potentially Inadequate Limits 
A more meaningful disadvantage associ ated with occurrence policies is th at the limits of such policies 
will not necessarily keep up with inflation and may result in an insured ha ving inadequate limits 
available to respond to one or more claims.  
Case-in-point: an insured physician purchased a $1 million limit in a January  1, 2006/2007 policy 
written on an occurrence basis. Assume that a high-dollar claim associated with a wrongful act 
committed during this policy period is not made until Ja nuary 1, 2013. In this situation, the $1 million 
occurrence policy limit from the January 1, 2006/2007  term will apply. However, had the physician 
been covered by a claims-made policy on the date th e claim was made, that policy is likely to have 
contained a higher limit than the occurrence policy written 7 years earlier. In addition, the physician may have had one or more other, smaller claims made against him—prior to the time the large claim 
was made in 2013—in conjunction with wrongful act s committed in 2006/2007. Such claims would 
also erode the policy’s $1 million aggregate limit, a fact that adds to the problem of limit inadequacy 
under occurrence policies.  
No Coverage for Prior Acts 
It is common for professionals (especially in the early years of practicing) to work initially without professional liability insurance coverage. When such individuals do purchase an occurrence policy, they will be without coverage for wrongful acts that were committed prior to the inception date of the 
first policy. Exhibit 11.6 depicts this situation. 
 
    
 
 Chapter 11—How Occurrence C overage Triggers Operate 
83 EXHIBIT 11.6 
NO PRIOR ACTS COVERAGE IN OCCURRENCE POLICIES  
 
It should be mentioned that in certain instances, oc currence insurers will write policies that include 
coverage for prior acts. However, under an occurre nce policy form such as the one in Exhibit 11.6, 
coverage for prior acts does not apply. 
Note that the availability of coverage for prior acts is a corresponding advantage of claims-made 
policies (i.e., for professionals who do not purchase insurance at the inception of their practice and then obtain a claims-made policy).  
Greater Insurer Solvency Risk 
Insureds with occurrence policy forms face greater risks of coverage gaps caused by insurer 
insolvency than when their coverage is written on a claims-made policy form. This is especially true 
given the long-tailed nature of professional/executiv e liability claims. Admittedly, states do maintain 
guaranty funds to pay the outstanding claims of in solvent insurers. However, these funds cannot be 
relied upon to make full payment of such obliga tions, and in most cases, these claims are 
“compromised” at only 10 to 40 cents on the dollar.  
 
    
 
Professional Liability Insurance Coverage Triggers 
84 Two Examples 
First, consider a scenario where in Year 1, wh en an insured buys an occurrence policy from an 
insurer, the insurer is in strong financial condition. Since that time,  however, the insurer’s financial 
condition began to worsen, so that by Year 4, th e insured started buying coverage from a different 
insurer. Unfortunately for the insured, a wrongful act  committed in Year 1 results in a claim that is 
not made against the insured until Year 5 and the claim is not settled until Year 10. But by that time 
the insurer is insolvent. In contr ast, imagine this same scenario, except for the fact that in Year 1, the 
insured bought a claims-made policy from the same insurer. Also assume that in Year 4, as the insurer’s financial condition began to  worsen, that the insured changed to a new claims-made insurer. 
In this situation, when the claim was made against the insured in Year 5, the new—and solvent—
insurer would be responsible for covering the claim. 
A second scenario illustrates that under claims made- policies, insureds can react more quickly to 
situations where a claims-made insurer is havi ng financial problems, compared to how quickly 
insureds can react when such diffi culties affect an occurrence insurer. For instance, assume that at the 
end of a January 1, 2006/2007 claims-made policy term with Insurer A, an insured is notified that A 
is insolvent. To close the potential coverage gap created by this situa tion (i.e., no coverage for claims 
from acts that took place January 1, 2006 to January 1,  2007 that are made after January 1, 2007), the 
insured can purchase a replacement claims-made policy for the January 1, 2007/2008 term that covers 
prior acts back to January 1, 2006. On the other hand, if the insured’s January 1, 2006/2007 policy 
were written on an occurrence basis (and he or she replaced it with a January 1, 2007/2008 
occurrence policy), he or she would have a perm anent coverage gap as respects claims produced by 
acts committed from January 1, 2006 to January 1, 2007. 
Conclusion: An Occurrence versu s Claims-Made Choice Is Not 
Often Available 
Despite the disadvantages for an insured posed by claims-made versus occurrence policies, except for 
certain coverage lines already mentioned , insureds will virtually never be given the option of 
selecting a policy with an occurrence rather than a claims-made coverage trigger. In the 
preponderance of situations (media, law enforcemen t, medical malpractice, and hospital professional 
liability coverages are four of the few exceptions),  insureds have no choi ce but to accept coverage 
written on a claims-made basis. Thus, for most classes of professional/execu tive liability insurance, 
the claims-made coverage trigger represents the only available means of insuring against potential 
losses. 
Regardless of its drawbacks, claims-made covera ge triggers are a permanent fact of life in 
professional/executive liability insurance. The point of this course has not been to focus on the 
negative aspects of claims-made coverage. Rather, it has been to explain the problems inherent in 
such coverage so that those difficulties can be avoided or at least minimized.  
 
    Chapter 11—How Occurrence C overage Triggers Operate 
85 Chapter 11 Review Questions  
1. The only date that is relevant in triggering the coverage of an occurrence-type professional

a. claim is made against the insured. 
b. claim is paid to the claimant. 
c. claim is reported to the insurer. 
d. wrongful act allegedly harms the claimant. 
2. Clark Barr, a surveyor, has been somewhat inconsistent in maintaining his professional 
liability insurance. Clark has the following prof essional liability insurance history since he 
began his practice on January 1, 2000: from 2000 through 2003 he had occurrence  coverage 
from Insurer A; from 2004 through 2006 he had no professional liability policy; from 2007 to 
the present , he has claims-made  coverage from Insurer B that has a January 1, 2000 
retroactive date. In 2008, Diane makes a claim against Clark alleging that his mistake in surveying her property back in 2005 caused he r to build a home that encroaches on a highway 
right-of-way and must now be torn down. Based on this information, it appears that: 
a. Clark has coverage for this claim from both Insurer A and Insurer B. 
b. Clark has no coverage for this claim.  
c. Clark has coverage for the claim from Insurer A. 
d. Clark has coverage for this claim from Insurer B. 
3. Claims-made policies are more difficult to underw rite than occurrence policies for all of the 
following reasons, except: 
a. long tail nature of the exposures 
b. complexity of the rating process. 
c. decisions concerning prior acts coverage or exclusions.  
d. decisions concerning extended reporting periods. 
4. When moving from an occurrence policy to either a claims-made policy or another 
occurrence policy, there are never any gaps or uncovered exposures from prior policy periods 
as long as: 
a. coverage is continuously renewed.  
b. extended reporting periods are purchased. 
c. limits are increased. 
d. underwriting requirements are met.
