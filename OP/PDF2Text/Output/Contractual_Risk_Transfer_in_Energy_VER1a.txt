ivIntroduction
A
variety
of
contract
documents
describe
the
agreements
between
the
parties
involved
in
an
energy 
exploration
and
production
project.
These
written
contracts
impose
many
duties,
obligations,
and 
liabilities
on
various
parties.
Although
careful
attention
may
be
paid
to
the
operational
issues
these 
contracts
address,
often
little
or
no
attention
is
given
to
their
risk
and
insurance
implications. 
From
a
risk
management
perspective,
contracts
can
be
a
valuable
tool
or
a
deadly
trap.
Far
too
many 
contracts
are
drafted
or
modified
by
parties
who
know
little
about
insurance.
It
is
not
unusual
for
contracts 
to
shift
to
an
indemnitor
liabilities
that
are
extremely
difficult
or
costly
for
the
indemnitor
to
insure,
or 
they
are
even
uninsurable.
Some
contracts
actually
require
the
purchase
of
insurance
coverages
that
do 
not
exist
in
the
current
marketplace.
However,
the
fact
that
a
loss
is
uninsured
does
not
relieve
the 
indemnitor
of
its
contractual
liabilities
to
the
indemnitee.
When
the
indemnitor
fails
to
recognize
this
gap 
between
its
contract
and
its
coverage,
the
indemnitor
itself
bears
the
brunt
of
these
liabilities. 
Unfortunately,
onerous
contractual
provisions
are
often
accepted
without
complaint—and
often
without 
even
being
noticed,
particularly
when
the
business
climate
is
very
competitive.
Besides
potentially 
breaching
the
contract
with
regard
to
insurance
requirements,
blind
acceptance
of
risk-related
contractual 
provisions
exposes
firms
to
potentially
catastrophic
losses.
Such
unforeseen
catastrophes
are
rare,
but 
they
can
and
do
happen.
A
well-prepared
and
knowledgeable
insurance
agent
or
broker
can
help
clients 
avoid
unfortunate
and
costly
situations
of
this
type. 
This
course
examines
the
structure
of
contracting
relationships
in
energy
exploration
and
production
and 
the
key
provisions
in
which
responsibilities
and
liabilities
are
allocated
to
the
contracting
parties.
It
also 
suggests
methods
to
equitably
allocate
these
liabilities
and
examines
processes
for
managing
the 
contractual
risk
transfer
process.
It
also
points
out
problems
that
may
arise
if
contracts
are
not
properly 
reviewed
and
their
risks
managed. 
Chapter
1
of
Contractual
Risk
Transfer
in
Energy
introduces
key
concepts
that
provide
a
foundation
for 
this
course—major
players,
major
types
of
energy
contracts,
and
contractual
risk
allocation
in
general. 
Chapter
2
describes
three
types
of
contractual
risk
transfer
provisions—indemnity
(hold
harmless) 
provisions,
limitation
of
liability,
and
waiver
of
recovery
rights.
Chapter
3
then
deals
with
the
types
of 
insurance
requirements
found
in
energy
contracts. 
Chapters
4,
5,
and
6
examine
the
three
most
important
types
of
contracts:
joint
operating
agreements 
(JOAs),
drilling
contracts,
and
master
service
agreements
(MSAs),
with
emphasis
on
these
contracts’
risk 
transfer
provisions
and
ways
in
which
they
can
be
optimized
to
most
effectively
meet
the
contracting 
parties’
goals.
A
Glossary
of
terms

Contractual
Risk
Transfer
in
Energy:
An 
Overview
The
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
process
involves
several
different
parties
and
several
different 
types
of
contracts.
Like
the
participants,
these
contracts
are
unique
to
the
oil
and
gas
industry,
and
they 
differ
from
construction
contracts
and
general
business
contracts
in
some
important
ways.
Standardized 
language
is
available
for
some
of
these
contracts,
but
even
in
the
standardized
contract
forms,
the 
indemnity
provisions,
insurance
requirements,
and
other
risk
allocation
provisions
tend
to
be
sketchy. 
Typically,
these
provisions
have
to
be
expanded,
amended,
or
even
added
in
order
to
clearly
and
fairly 
assign
the
risks
of
loss
associated
with
the
project. 
The
first
part
of
this
chapter
provides
a
broad
overview
of
the
energy
exploration
and
production
process 
and
identifies
the
major
parties
involved.
The
chapter
then
explains
the
major
types
of
contracts
that 
describe
the
agreements
among
these
various
participants
that,
among
other
things,
serve
to
allocate
the 
risks
involved
in
the
process.
The
chapter
concludes
by
discussing
risk
allocation
and
contract
review
and 
negotiation
principles. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
distinguish
between
the
roles
of
the
major
parties
involved
in
energy
exploration
and
production,
2.
identify
the
purpose
of
each
of
the
major
types
of
contracts
used
in
energy
exploration
and 
production,
3.
recognize
basic
risk
allocation
principles,
and
4.
recognize
the
importance
of
reviewing
and
negotiating
risk
and
insurance
provisions
in
various 
contracts.
Energy
Exploration
and
Production
Overview
This
section
of
the
chapter
provides
a
broad-brush
review
of
the
steps
involved
in
exploration
and 
production
of
oil
and
gas,
from
the
time
the
idea
to
drill
for
oil
or
gas
is
conceived
until
the
product 
passes
into
the
pipeline.
This
overview
also
introduces
the
major
contracts
involved
in
the
exploration
and 
production
of
oil
and
gas. 
The
Major
Players
Three
major
groups
of
parties
are
involved
in
energy
exploration
and
production. 
•
Oil
operators
•
Drilling
contractors
•
Well
service
contractors
The
lines
of
demarcation
between
these
three
functions
are
pretty
well
defined.
The
operator
will
almost 
never
own
a
drilling
rig.
A
large
drilling
contractor
may
operate
some
wells,
but
this
is
usually
done 
through
a
separate
company.
Similarly,
some
drilling
contractors
have
well
service
operations,
but
they
3generally
are
carried
out
by
separate
companies. 
The
Oil
Operator
The
oil
operator
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
oil
man,
the
oil
company,
or
the
producer.
(Although 
drilling
for
gas
currently
represents
over
75
percent
of
the
drilling
in
the
United
States
and
Canada,
the 
time-honored
phrase
“oil
operator”
lingers
on.)
The
oil
operator
can
be
a
single
individual
or
a 
multinational
corporation
such
as
Shell
or
British
Petroleum.
It
is
the
oil
operator
that
decides
where
there 
may
be
hydrocarbons
that
will
warrant
having
a
well
drilled
to
produce
them. 
Once
someone
in
the
oil
operator’s
organization
(perhaps
in
top
management
or
in
the
geology
division) 
decides
that
a
certain
area
has
the
possibility
of
producing
hydrocarbons,
the
operator’s
geologist(s),
with 
the
help
of
seismographic
maps,
logs,
and
other
data,
then
put
together
a
subterranean
map
showing
any 
traps
or
inclines
that
can
hold
hydrocarbons.
If
a
seismographic
map
is
not
available,
the
operator
may 
enlist
a
seismic
firm
to
“shoot”
one.
A
seismographic
map
is
made
by
using
a
series
of
underground 
explosions
to
record
the
depth
and
density
of
the
various
strata
by
measuring
the
echoes
from
the
blasts. 
By
obtaining
the
time
interval
between
the
explosion
and
the
reflected
and
refracted
shock
wave, 
geophysicists
can
approximate
the
underground
structure,
since
the
deeper
the
strata
the
longer
the
time 
interval.
From
these
data,
geophysicists
prepare
a
contour
map
indicating
the
presence
of
structural
traps 
(if
any)
in
the
subsurface.
This
map
helps
the
geologist
determine
the
presence
of
hydrocarbons. 
The
oil
operator’s
“landman”
then
proceeds
to
lease
the
right
to
produce
these
minerals
from
the
mineral 
owner.
The
mineral
owner
may
or
may
not
be
owner
of
the
land
that
contains
the
minerals.
It
is
the 
mineral
owner
who
has
the
right
to
drill
to
recover
the
minerals. 
There
are
basically
two
types
of
mineral
interests. 
•
The
party
with
the
working
interest
in
the
minerals
has
the
responsibility
to
recover
the
minerals 
and
bears
all
costs
and
liabilities.
•
The
party
with
the
royalty
interest
(the
mineral
owner)
gets
a
certain
portion
of
the
income
off
of 
the
top
(usually
12.5
percent)
without
any
cost
or
liabilities.
All
other
types
of
mineral
interests
derive
from
these
two
interests. 
Once
the
mineral
lease
is
in
hand,
the
oil
operator’s
exploration
department
puts
together
a
budget
for 
drilling
the
well,
known
as
an
authority
for
expenditure
(AFE).
At
this
point,
the
operator
may
decide
not 
to
take
100
percent
of
the
risk
but
instead
to
seek
investors.
These
investors
are
usually,
but
not
always, 
other
operators.
The
operator
sells
part
of
the
working
interest
to
the
investors,
usually
keeping
the
largest 
interest
for
itself.
These
investors
become
nonoperating
working
interest
owners. 
The
operator
could
have
from
five
people
to
several
hundred
people
on
staff.
However,
the
functions
of 
the
operator
are
the
same
regardless
of
the
organization’s
size:
geology,
petroleum
engineering,
land 
management,
drilling
supervision,
production
supervision,
oil
and
gas
sales,
financial
management,
legal 
matters,
and
administration.
These
operations
may
be
carried
out
by
employees
or
by
drilling
consultants. 
The
Drilling
Contractor
The
next
major
player
in
the
exploration
and
production
process
is
the
drilling
contractor,
also
known
as 
the
driller.
The
drilling
contractor
owns
the
drilling
rig
and
has
the
employees
to
run
it.
Some
drilling 
contractors
own
only
one
rig,
while
others
own
a
number
of
vessels
that
are
capable
of
drilling
in
water
as 
much
as
a
mile
deep. 
The
oil
operator
contacts
the
drilling
contractor
and
asks
for
a
bid
on
drilling
the
proposed
well. 
Depending
on
the
tightness
of
the
market,
a
number
of
drilling
contractors
may
be
asked
to
bid. 
Once
the
price
is
agreed
on,
the
drilling
site
is
prepared
by
a
specialty
contractor.
Site
preparation
takes
a 
few
days.
Then
the
drilling
rig
is
brought
in
and
“rigged
up.”
This
extremely
large
piece
of
equipment 
(with
a
derrick
that
towers
over
120
feet
tall)
and
its
component
parts
(engines,
hoisting
works,
pumps, 
pipe,
and
pipe
racks,
etc.)
are
brought
to
the
drilling
site
by
several
trucks
and
assembled
by
the
rig
crew.
4The
self-contained
equipment
raises
the
mast
to
an
upright
position
and
secures
it
to
anchors
in
the 
ground
with
guy
wires.
The
entire
process
takes
only
a
day
or
so,
depending
on
the
particular
terrain. 
Finally,
drilling
begins.
The
crew
of
the
drilling
rig
typically
consists
of
the
following. 
•
Tool
pusher
—The
foreman
who
makes
certain
everything
is
running
correctly
and
who
stays
at 
the
rig
24
hours
a
day,
7
days
a
week.
•
Driller
—The
person
who
runs
the
controls
of
the
rig
that
govern
how
fast
the
drill
bit
turns.
•
Tower
man
—The
individual
who
stands
on
the
“monkey
board”
high
in
the
rig
and
guides
the 
drill
pipe
into
position
for
connection.
•
Floor
hands
or
roughnecks
—Three
to
six
individuals
who
make
the
connections
of
the
new 
“stand”
of
pipe
to
the
string
already
in
the
hole
and
do
the
general
work
around
the
rig.
•
Mud
engineer
—The
person
who
makes
certain
that
the
drilling
fluid
(called
“mud”)
has
the 
proper
mixture.
This
position
may
be
filled
by
one
of
the
other
workers.
The
mud
is
extremely 
important
in
the
drilling
of
a
well.
It
is
a
combination
of
dry
powder
mixed
with
a
water
or
oil
base 
that
circulates
through
the
system
to
lubricate
the
drill
bit,
return
the
cuttings
to
the
surface, 
and—of
greatest
importance—keep
subterranean
pressure
from
entering
the
circulating
system
and 
causing
a
blowout.
While
the
tool
pusher
stays
at
the
rig
continually,
the
other
members
of
the
drilling
crew
usually
serve 
8-hour
tours
(pronounced
“towers”).
Drilling
continues
24
hours
a
day
until
the
anticipated
depth
is 
reached.
At
this
point,
the
operator
decides
to
either
complete
the
well
(make
it
ready
to
produce 
hydrocarbons)
or
to
plug
and
abandon
it. 
Another
person
who
stays
at
the
rig
continually
is
the
drilling
superintendent
(sometimes
referred
to
as
the 
“company
man”).
The
drilling
superintendent
is
an
employee
of
the
operator
who
is
there
to
make 
decisions
that
cannot
wait
long
enough
to
be
relayed
back
to
the
operator’s
office
for
discussion. 
Well
Service
Contractors
If
the
oil
operator
decides
that
the
well
probably
will
produce
enough
hydrocarbons
to
make
it 
commercially
viable,
it
hires
specialty
contractors
to
complete
the
well.
The
process
of
completing
the 
well
includes
a
number
of
separate
processes,
such
as
fracturing
the
strata,
perforating
the
hole,
setting
the 
casing,
and
cementing
the
casing.
The
specialty
contractors
that
perform
these
tasks
are
referred
to
as
well 
service
contractors.
Some
of
these
contractors
will
perform
a
myriad
of
services,
but
most
specialize
in 
one
particular
type
of
well
service. 
Well
service
contractors
do
everything
to
the
well
except
the
initial
drilling.
They
are
necessary
from 
completion
of
the
well
through
its
entire
producing
life.
Well
service
contractors
range
in
size
from
a 
one-man
welder
to
extremely
large
companies
(like
Schlumberger
or
Halliburton)
that
do
jobs
that
may 
require
multimillion-dollar
equipment
and
dozens
of
workers
at
the
site. 
Major
Types
of
Contracts
With
all
the
different
types
of
contractors
involved
in
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production,
a
multitude 
of
contracts
are
used.
The
key
contracts
are
the
following. 
•
Mineral
lease
•
Farmout
agreement
•
Joint
operating
agreement
•
Drilling
contract
•
Master
service
agreement
•
Master
charter
agreement
5Mineral
Lease
The
oil
operator
generally
begins
the
energy
exploration
and
production
process
by
identifying
a 
promising
site
and
then
leasing
the
right
to
obtain
the
minerals
from
the
ground
from
the
owner
of
the 
mineral
rights.
The
first
contract
in
the
process
is
the
mineral
lease
that
the
operator
signs
with
the
owner 
of
the
mineral
rights.
Of
all
the
agreements
discussed
here,
the
mineral
lease
generally
requires
the
least 
amount
of
attention. 
Various
mineral
lease
forms
are
used,
but
the
general
principle
is
the
same.
In
the
lease,
the
lessee
(the
oil 
operator)
is
granted
the
right
to
drill
for
hydrocarbons
and
to
produce
them
for
a
specified
number
of 
years.
The
lessee
assumes
all
of
the
costs
and
liabilities
and
gives
the
mineral
owner
a
royalty,
usually 
one-eighth
(12.5
percent)
of
the
production. 
Risk
Allocation
The
mineral
lease
puts
all
liability
for
loss
on
the
working
interest
owner.
There
is
no
negotiation
on
that 
point.
Most
mineral
owners
therefore
assume
that
they
are
“off
the
hook.”
However,
this
can
be
wishful 
thinking.
If,
for
instance,
there
is
a
blowout
or
a
pollution
claim
and
the
operator
declares
bankruptcy,
the 
mineral
owner
could
be
next
in
line
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
resulting
expenses.
For
the
mineral
owner’s 
protection,
therefore,
it
is
prudent
to
require
the
lessee
to
maintain
certain
types
and
amounts
of
insurance 
and
to
name
the
mineral
owner
as
an
additional
insured
on
the
policies. 
Insurance
Requirements
The
insurance
requirements
for
the
mineral
lease
are
usually
pretty
basic.
Generally,
the
lessor
should 
require
the
lessee
to
maintain
control
of
well
insurance,
plus
commercial
general
liability
insurance, 
business
auto
liability
insurance,
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance,
and
(if
needed 
to
provide
sufficient
limits
of
insurance)
umbrella
liability
insurance. 
For
the
liability
coverage,
the
most
common
limit
arrangement
is
$1
million
per
occurrence
and
$2 
million
general
aggregate
for
general
liability,
with
$1
million
aggregate
for
underground
resources
and 
equipment;
a
$1
million
per-occurrence
limit
for
auto
liability;
a
$1
million
per
accident
limit
for 
employers
liability;
and
an
umbrella
with
a
limit
of
at
least
$5
million.
For
control
of
well
coverage,
most 
lessors
insist
on
a
limit
of
at
least
$3
million
per
occurrence. 
Surface
Damage
Agreement
The
mineral
lease
allows
the
lessee
to
use
as
much
of
the
surface
as
necessary
to
drill
the
well—no
more, 
no
less.
In
the
process
of
gaining
access
to
the
hydrocarbons,
the
lessee
is
virtually
certain
to
do
at
least 
some
damage
to
the
surface
of
the
land.
This
ordinary
and
predictable
damage
to
the
surface,
referred
to 
as
“surface
damage,”
is
usually
dealt
with
by
means
of
a
surface
damage
or
surface
use
agreement 
between
the
surface
owner
(who
may
or
may
not
be
the
mineral
owner)
and
the
lessee.
Generally,
the 
surface
damage
agreement
is
a
separate
agreement;
it
is
not
part
of
the
mineral
lease. 
In
the
surface
damage
agreement,
the
lessee
agrees
to
pay
the
surface
owner
a
flat
fee
in
return
for
the 
surface
owner’s
agreement
to
waive
any
other
recovery
rights
for
damage
to
the
surface
resulting
from 
normal
wear
and
tear
from
the
lessee’s
mineral
lease
activities.
(In
the
event
of
major
damage,
exceeding 
that
which
results
from
normal
wear
and
tear,
the
surface
owner
may
have
a
claim
against
the
lessee
that 
would
be
covered
by
the
lessee’s
insurance
program.) 
Farmout
Agreement
If
an
oil
operator
has
a
mineral
lease
but
does
not
have
any
immediate
plans
to
drill
on
it
or
cannot
afford 
to
drill
on
it,
it
may
“farm
out”
the
lease
to
another
operator
who
is
interested
in
drilling
a
well
on
the 
lease,
using
a
farmout
agreement.
In
the
farmout
agreement,
the
farmoutee
agrees
to
be
responsible
for
all 
costs
and
liabilities
with
respect
to
the
well
that
will
be
drilled
and
to
hold
the
mineral
lease
owner
(the 
farmoutor)
harmless
from
such
costs
and
liabilities,
regardless
of
the
cause.
It
is
prudent,
therefore,
to
get 
the
farmoutee
to
back
up
this
indemnification
with
insurance. 
Under
the
typical
farmout
agreement,
if
the
new
operator
(the
“farmoutee”)
makes
a
good
well
(a
well
6that
will
produce
an
acceptable
quantity
of
oil
or
gas),
it
gets
to
recoup
its
costs
of
drilling
and
completing 
the
well
(its
“payout”)
from
the
initial
production
of
the
well.
Then
the
original
operator
(the
“farmoutor”) 
comes
back
in
for
a
percentage
ownership
of
the
well’s
production
(typically,
around
50
percent). 
While
the
concept
of
the
farmout
agreement
is
very
well
accepted
in
the
industry,
there
is
no
standard 
farmout
agreement.
Therefore,
the
content
and
language
of
the
provisions
can
vary
greatly
from
one 
farmout
agreement
to
another. 
Payout
The
definition
of
the
term
“payout”
in
the
farmout
agreement
is
very
important.
Quite
often
“payout”
is 
simply
defined
as
the
cost
to
drill
and
complete
the
well.
While
this
may
seem
logical,
consider
a
situation 
where
the
farmoutee
spends
$1
million
drilling
the
well
and
then
has
a
blowout.
The
control
of
well 
insurer
pays
another
$1
million
to
control
the
well
and
redrill
it.
The
cost
of
drilling
and
completing
the 
well
is
now
$2
million.
If
“payout”
has
been
defined
as
the
cost
to
drill
and
complete
the
well,
the 
farmoutor
has
to
wait
until
all
$2
million
is
recovered
by
the
farmoutee
before
it
can
begin
to
collect
its 
share
of
the
well’s
production.
If
the
farmoutor’s
share
is
50
percent,
this
would
be
a
loss
of
$500,000
(50 
percent
of
the
additional
$1
million
of
cost)
for
the
farmoutor.
The
farmoutee,
on
the
other
hand,
gets
to 
collect
$2
million
before
starting
to
pay
the
farmoutor’s
share
but
is
out
of
pocket
for
only
$1
million
(less 
the
insurance
premium),
because
the
control
of
well
insurer
has
paid
the
$1
million
additional
cost.
While 
this
may
seem
unfair,
the
courts
have
upheld
this
result.
The
court’s
rationale:
The
farmoutee
can
get
the 
extra
amount
needed
to
control
the
well
from
any
source
available.
The
source
of
the
money
is
of
no 
concern
to
the
farmoutor
unless
this
is
addressed
in
the
farmout
agreement. 
The
answer
to
this
predicament
is
really
quite
simple.
The
definition
of
“payout”
should
state
that
payout 
means
the
cost
of
drilling
and
completing
the
well
less
any
insurance
proceeds.
This
keeps
the
farmoutee 
from
getting
the
insurance
money
and
still
taking
production. 
Control
of
Well
Insurance
It
is
important
that
the
farmoutee
carry
control
of
well
insurance.
This
coverage
pays
the
expenses
of 
controlling
a
well
that
is
out
of
control
(a
blowout),
along
with
other
related
costs,
such
as
the
cost
of 
redrilling
the
well.
If
the
farmoutee
has
a
blowout
and
abandons
the
project
because
it
does
not
have
the 
money
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
controlling
the
blowout,
the
mineral
lease
owner
(the
farmoutor)
will
have
to 
pay
the
costs.
Therefore
it
is
essential
that
control
of
well
insurance
be
carried
by
the
farmoutee
and
that 
the
farmoutor
is
named
as
an
additional
insured. 
Other
Insurance
Requirements
Other
insurance
requirements
for
the
farmout
agreement
are
usually
the
same
as
for
the
mineral
lease: 
commercial
general
liability
insurance,
commercial
auto
liability
insurance,
workers
compensation
and 
employers
liability
insurance,
and
(if
needed
to
provide
sufficient
limits
of
insurance)
umbrella
liability 
insurance. 
Joint
Operating
Agreement
If
the
operator
gets
others
to
invest
in
the
well
by
selling
them
nonoperating
working
interests,
a
very 
powerful
instrument
called
the
joint
operating
agreement
(JOA)
is
used.
This
instrument
provides
a
basis 
for
sharing
rights
and
liabilities
among
the
parties
involved
and
provides
rules
for
the
conduct
of 
operations. 
Joint
operations
enable
energy
companies
to
take
on
larger,
more
complex,
and
riskier
projects
than
they 
would
be
willing
or
able
to
handle
on
their
own.
However,
the
joint
venture
operations
can
result
in 
liability
exposures
that
create
risk
management
and
insurance
challenges.
Successfully
addressing
these 
challenges
begins
at
the
very
inception
of
the
joint
venture,
with
the
drafting
of
the
JOA. 
Joint
operating
agreements
are
examined
in
more
detail
in
Chapter
4. 
Drilling
Contract
7The
drilling
contract
is
the
most
commonly
studied
document
in
the
exploration
and
production
industry. 
The
most
frequently
used
drilling
contract
form
is
promulgated
by
the
International
Association
of 
Drilling
Contractors
(IADC). 
There
are
three
IADC
forms
for
land
wells: 
•
the
footage
contract
,
in
which
the
contractor
gets
paid
per
foot
drilled;
•
the
daywork
contract
,
in
which
the
contractor
gets
paid
a
fixed
amount
per
day
regardless
of
how 
many
feet
are
drilled;
and
•
the
turnkey
contract
,
in
which
the
contractor
must
drill
to
a
certain
depth
in
order
to
get
paid.
The
IADC
also
promulgates
offshore
drilling
contracts
and
foreign
drilling
contracts. 
The
indemnifications
and
liabilities
vary
in
each
of
these
drilling
contracts.
Some
very
important
risk 
allocation
issues
must
be
addressed
before
the
drilling
contract
is
an
acceptable
instrument.
These 
contracts
and
issues
are
examined
in
Chapter
5. 
Master
Service
Agreement
The
contract
that
establishes
liabilities
and
indemnification
between
the
operator
and
each
well
service 
contractor
is
called
the
master
service
agreement
(MSA).
While
the
major
and
large
independent
oil 
operators
have
used
MSAs
for
many
years,
the
growth
in
the
use
of
this
important
document
in
the
last 
decade
has
been
phenomenal.
Ten
years
ago
relatively
few
operators
put
much
stock
in
using
one.
Today, 
both
operators
and
well
service
contractors
typically
insist
on
having
an
MSA
in
place. 
Operators,
contractors,
and
especially
insurers
realize
that
things
can
go
wrong
on
a
producing
well. 
Using
an
MSA
allows
the
operator
and
well
service
contractors
to
assign
liabilities
before
anything
goes 
wrong
and
to
use
risk
management
as
a
tool
in
deciding
how
to
handle
any
loss.
MSAs
are
examined
in 
Chapter
6. 
Master
Charter
Agreement
The
master
charter
agreement
(MCA)
and
the
charter
party
agreement
are
important
contracts
for 
operators
that
have
“wet”
operations—that
is,
wells
that
would
involve
maritime
operations
even
in
the 
slightest
degree. 
Consider
a
well
being
drilled
in
West
Texas.
If
the
drilling
supervisor
needs
more
mud,
the
dry
mud
sacks 
are
delivered
by
truck
and
left
at
the
well
site.
If
the
well
is
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico,
the
operator
has
to 
charter
both
a
barge
to
hold
the
dry
mud
sacks
and
a
tug
to
deliver
the
barge.
The
tug
brings
the
barge
out 
and
leaves
it.
The
charter
is
in
effect
the
entire
time
the
barge
is
on
the
drill
site.
The
charter
party 
agreement
determines
who
is
responsible
both
for
the
damage
done
by
the
barge
and
for
the
damage
to 
the
barge.
It
is
important
that
a
standardized
master
charter
agreement
be
used
so
that
both
parties
know 
what
to
expect. 
Risk
Allocation
in
Contracts
The
following
discussion
deals
with
contractual
risk
allocation
in
general.
Risk
allocation
in
energy 
contracts
is
discussed
in
later
chapters. 
Some
would
argue
that
the
goal
of
contractual
risk
allocation
is
to
push
as
much
risk
onto
another
party
as 
possible.
At
each
contracting
level,
various
risks
tend
to
get
pushed
down
to
the
next
tier.
With 
construction
contracts,
for
example,
the
owner
shifts
certain
liabilities
to
the
general
contractor,
which
in 
turn
shifts
part
of
these
liabilities
to
various
subcontractors.
The
subcontractors
shift
part
of
their 
liabilities
to
their
sub-subcontractors,
etc.
The
upstream
party
typically
has
the
greater
bargaining
power, 
and
the
further
downstream
a
contractor
is,
the
less
bargaining
power
it
will
have.
In
most
instances,
this 
is
because
competition
at
the
trade
level
is
very
stiff;
a
contractor
that
refuses
to
accept
onerous
contract 
provisions
is
easily
replaced
by
another
that
will.
Further,
smaller
contractors
often
lack
the
expertise
to 
identify
problematic
provisions
and
negotiate
effectively.
That
is,
most
do
not
have
full-time
risk 
managers
or
in-house
legal
counsel
who
can
assist
in
contract
review
and
negotiations.
8Some
firms
take
full
advantage
of
their
bargaining
positions
to
shift
as
much
risk
as
possible
down
the 
“food
chain.”
Unfortunately,
what
often
happens
is
that
lower-tier
subcontractors,
which
need
work
to 
survive,
are
forced
to
assume
liabilities
that
are
outside
their
control
and
that
they
cannot
afford.
For 
example,
in
some
states,
a
contracting
party
can
shift
liability
for
its
sole
negligence
to
the
other
party.
As 
these
liabilities
get
shifted
further
down
the
chain,
more
and
more
risk
falls
on
the
parties
that
are 
typically
least
able
to
bear
it. 
A
better
approach
is
to
strive
for
an
equitable
allocation
of
risks.
A
number
of
factors
can
influence
the 
appropriate
allocation
of
specific
risks,
including
which
party
is
in
the
best
position
to
control
the
risk, 
which
party
has
the
financial
wherewithal
to
bear
the
risk,
and
which
party
will
obtain
the
ultimate
benefit 
of
the
undertaking
that
creates
the
risk.
Minimizing
time-consuming
and
costly
litigation
is
another 
critical
factor. 
In
addition
to
which
party
will
bear
the
risk,
disagreements
also
arise
over
which
party
will
purchase 
insurance
to
cover
the
loss.
In
most
instances,
the
best
way
to
handle
this
is
to
allow
the
party
that
bears 
the
risk
of
loss
to
purchase
insurance
to
cover
its
exposure.
Unfortunately,
that
is
not
the
way
the 
contracts
are
always
written. 
While
parties
may
disagree
on
where
the
lines
of
fair
and
acceptable
risk
allocations
fall,
they
should 
come
to
the
negotiation
table
with
the
intent
to
treat
the
other
party
as
they
would
want
to
be 
treated—fairly
and
professionally.
Where
risks
are
transferred,
the
party
accepting
the
risk
should
be 
allowed
to
factor
it
into
the
contract
price.
While
there
may
be
other
contractors
or
subcontractors
willing 
to
accept
more
onerous
provisions,
contractors
are
not
all
created
equal.
The
goal
should
be
to
hire
the 
right
contractor
for
the
job
and
to
craft
an
agreement
that
is
fair
and
beneficial
to
both
parties. 
Unfortunately,
the
ideal
is
not
always
the
reality,
so
contractors
should
go
to
the
table
with
three
sets
of 
parameters.
First,
they
should
have
their
wish
list—their
preferred
positions
on
various
provisions. 
Second,
they
should
have
a
fallback
position—not
ideal,
but
acceptable.
And
third,
they
should
have
a
list 
of
“deal
breakers”—contract
provisions
that
expose
the
firm
to
an
unacceptable
degree
of
risk
such
that 
the
contractor
will
walk
away
from
the
project.
Throughout
this
course,
we
will
provide
some
insights 
into
preferred
and
generally
acceptable
positions.
However,
individual
contractors
must
make
their
own 
decisions
on
these
issues
based
on
their
individual
circumstances
and
tolerance
for
risk. 
Coordination
with
Insurance
The
importance
of
coordinating
contract
provisions
and
insurance
policy
provisions
cannot
be 
overemphasized.
All
major
contracts
should
be
reviewed
by
legal
counsel
and
the
firm’s
risk
management 
adviser
(whether
an
in-house
risk
manager,
agent,
broker,
or
consultant)
before
being
executed. 
Contractors’
downstream
contracts,
such
as
a
standard
subcontract
agreement,
should
also
be
reviewed. 
An
attempt
should
be
made
to
negotiate
more
reasonable
terms,
where
warranted.
Except
on
very
small 
projects,
contracts
are
rarely
executed
without
some
changes,
even
when
standardized
contracts
are
used. 
Owners
that
are
truly
interested
in
developing
an
agreement
that
is
equitable
to
both
parties
will
generally 
negotiate
with
the
contractor
regarding
a
number
of
important
provisions.
Sometimes
all
it
takes
is 
educating
them
about
the
ramifications
of
certain
provisions
in
order
to
convince
them
that
changes
are 
necessary.
When
owners
(or
other
contractors)
will
not
make
any
concessions,
the
contractor
can
either 
walk
away
(if
the
risks
outweigh
the
benefits)
or
make
an
informed
management
decision
to
accept
the 
risk
allocations
and
plan
for
them.
(When
a
contract
is
offered
on
a
“take
it
or
leave
it”
basis,
contractors 
should
carefully
consider
their
involvement
in
the
project.
An
owner
that
is
this
rigid
at
the
beginning
of 
the
process
is
generally
equally
rigid
with
respect
to
other
aspects
of
the
project.) 
Any
section
of
a
contract
can
have
significant
risk
management
implications,
but
there
are
three
specific 
areas
of
particular
concern: 
•
hold
harmless/indemnity
provisions,
which
transfer
one
party’s
liabilities
to
another
party;
•
waivers
of
subrogation,
which
prohibit
one
party’s
insurer
from
bringing
suit
(or
subrogating) 
against
another
party;
and
9•
insurance
requirements,
which
stipulate
the
types
and
amounts
of
coverage
each
party
agrees
to 
provide.
Some
contracts
also
include
limitations
of
liability,
which
limit
the
indemnitee’s
recovery
against
another 
party
to
a
specified
amount,
such
as
the
fee
paid
for
the
indemnitee’s
services. 
Later
chapters
include
more
detail
on
these
important
factors. 
10Chapter
2
 
Risk
Transfer
Provisions
This
chapter
examines
three
types
of
contractual
provisions
used
to
effect
risk
transfers. 
•
Indemnity
provisions,
also
commonly
referred
to
as
hold
harmless
provisions,
require
one
party
to 
indemnify
(compensate)
the
other
party
(the
indemnitee)
for
costs
incurred
by
the
transferor
(the 
indemnitor).
•
A
party
can
contractually
limit
its
liability
for
certain
losses.
This
effectively
shifts
the
risk
of
loss 
in
excess
of
that
limit
to
the
other
contracting
party.
•
A
contracting
party
can
require
the
other
party
to
waive
its
right
to
pursue
recovery
against
the
first 
party
for
certain
types
of
losses.
When
a
party
waives
its
own
right
of
recovery,
it
also
effectively 
waives
its
insurer’s
right
to
pursue
recovery
against
a
negligent
party
for
amounts
paid
under
the 
policy.
To
support
the
risk
transfers,
most
contracts
also
stipulate
the
purchase
of
certain
insurance
coverages
that 
will
respond
to
these
liabilities.
The
types
of
insurance
that
address
these
requirements
are
discussed
in 
Chapter
3. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
recognize
the
effect
of
indemnity
(hold
harmless)
provisions
in
a
contract
and
their
relation
to 
insurance
coverage;
2.
distinguish
between
broad
form,
intermediate
form,
and
comparative
(limited)
form 
indemnification
provisions;
and
3.
recognize
the
effect
of
a
contract’s
limitation
of
liability
clause.
Indemnity
(Hold
Harmless)
Provisions
Under
an
indemnity,
or
hold
harmless,
agreement,
one
party
(the
indemnitor
)
agrees
to
indemnify
the 
other
party
(the
indemnitee
)
for
certain
liabilities
arising
out
of
the
performance
of
the
contract.
Our 
discussion
begins
by
examining
how
construction
contracts
approach
the
subject. 
In
construction
contracts,
the
rationale
for
indemnification
provisions
is
that
the
risk
of
loss
will
be 
allocated
to
the
party
that,
at
least
conceptually,
has
the
most
control
over
the
exposure.
In
energy 
contracts,
however,
different
rationale
may
apply
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
contract.
For
example, 
risks
may
be
allocated
based
on
the
amount
of
each
party’s
level
of
participation
in
and
contribution
to
a 
joint
operation,
or
it
may
be
based
on
the
ownership
of
personnel
and
property
rather
than
fault.
These 
rationales
are
examined
in
later
chapters. 
Indemnity
Provisions
in
Contracts
In
the
energy
industry,
contract
relationships
are
best
viewed
as
a
tiered
structure.
The
hiring
party
is 
referred
to
as
the
“upstream”
party,
and
the
party
being
hired
is
referred
to
as
the
“downstream”
party. 
Typically,
the
contract
with
the
owner
is
referred
to
as
the
“prime
contract,”
and
the
various
downstream 
contracts
are
referred
to
as
“subcontracts.”
Subcontractors
have
no
direct
contractual
relationship,
and 
thus
no
duty,
to
the
owner
on
the
project.
The
general
contractor’s
obligation
to
the
owner
is
not
altered
11by
its
use
of
subcontractors.
In
the
event
of
a
problem
with
a
subcontractor’s
work,
the
owner
will
make 
its
claim
against
the
general
contractor,
which
will
in
turn
make
a
claim
against
the
subcontractor. 
Whether
the
general
contractor
can
collect
anything
from
the
subcontractor
is
not
relevant
to
its 
responsibility
to
the
owner. 
In
most
construction
contracts,
the
upstream
party
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
indemnity
provision
(the 
indemnitee)
and
the
downstream
party
is
the
one
agreeing
to
assume
certain
liabilities
associated
with
the 
hazards
of
the
construction
project
(the
indemnitor
).
Therefore,
under
a
prime
contract
1
,
the
owner
is 
usually
the
indemnitee
and
the
general
contractor
is
the
indemnitor.
However,
in
a
subcontract,
the 
general
contractor
is
typically
the
indemnitee,
the
subcontractor
is
the
indemnitor,
and
so
on
down
the 
various
tiers
of
subcontracts. 
Two
important
observations
are
in
order
here. 
•
The
indemnity
agreement
does
not
relieve
the
indemnitee
of
liability
to
the
injured
third
party
.
The 
indemnitee
is
responsible
for
damages
awarded
to
the
injured
party
whether
or
not
the
indemnitor 
responds
to
its
obligation
to
indemnify.
If,
for
example,
the
indemnitor
does
not
have
the
financial 
resources
to
respond
to
its
obligation
to
indemnify,
the
indemnitee
will
still
be
required
to
pay 
damages
to
the
injured
party.
To
ensure
that
indemnitors
have
the
financial
resources
to
respond, 
most
contracts
containing
indemnity
agreements
also
require
indemnitors
to
purchase
insurance 
that
will
respond
to
these
contractually
assumed
liabilities.
•
The
transfer
of
risk
is
usually
independent
of
insurance
coverage
.
That
is,
the
contractual 
obligation
stands
on
its
own
and
is
not
governed
by
the
existence
or
scope
of
the
indemnitor’s 
insurance.
Thus,
an
indemnitor
may
be
required
to
indemnify
a
loss
that
its
insurance
does
not 
cover.
If
the
contract
complies
with
any
statutory
restrictions,
the
courts
will
enforce
a
contract’s
hold
harmless 
agreement
as
written.
When
parties
enter
into
a
written
risk
transfer
agreement,
they
usually
forfeit
their 
opportunity
to
have
liabilities
governed
by
general
negligence
principles.
The
indemnity
provision,
as
part 
of
a
valid
contract,
effectively
replaces
common
law
and
becomes
the
governing
law
with
regard
to 
indemnification
issues
between
the
parties.
Therefore,
contracting
parties
should
be
very
careful
that
the 
language
chosen
reflects
their
intended
allocation
of
risk. 
Scope
of
Indemnification
Obligation
Indemnification
provisions
fall
into
one
of
three
categories. 
•
Broad
form
•
Comparative
(or
limited)
•
Intermediate
form
In
each
type,
the
indemnitor
agrees
to
provide
indemnity
for
costs
that
result
from
its
own
negligence. 
Where
they
differ
is
in
regard
to
the
extent
to
which
the
indemnitor
is
required
to
provide
indemnification 
for
losses
that
are
the
result
of
the
indemnitee’s
negligence.
The
net
scope
of
each
form
of
indemnity
is 
summarized
in
Exhibit
2.1.

Broad

Most
states 
prohibit
or
severely 
limit
the
transfer
of 
liability
for
one’s 
own
negligence, 
which
in
turn
limits 
the
use
of
broad 
form
indemnity 
provisions.
Intermediate
Form
 
The
obligation
to 
indemnify
is
not 
limited
by
the 
degree
of
the 
indemnitee’s
contribution,
as 
long
as
the 
indemnitor’s
negligence
was
a 
contributory
cause 
of
the
loss.
Comparative
(Limited)
Form
This
type
of 
agreement
mirrors 
the
obligations
imposed
by
tort 
law.
A
common
application
of
the
indemnity
agreement
in
an
oil
field
setting
is
in
regard
to
a 
“third-party-over”
action
brought
by
an
injured
worker
against
other
parties
on
the
project.
In
most
states, 
by
virtue
of
the
workers
compensation
statute,
an
injured
worker’s
recovery
against
his
or
her
own 
employer
would
be
limited
to
workers
compensation
benefits
(i.e.,
medical
expenses
and
statutory
lost 
wage
benefits).
However,
a
well
service
contractor’s
employee
can
sue
a
nonemployer,
such
as
the
oil 
operator,
for
damages
over
and
above
those
allowed
under
the
workers
compensation
statute.
If
a
hold 
harmless
agreement
is
in
place
between
the
worker’s
employer
and
the
party
being
sued
(as
there
usually 
is),
the
indemnitee
will
seek
indemnification
for
amounts
paid
to
the
injured
worker.
This
claim
for 
indemnity
for
injury
to
the
insured’s
own
employee
is
known
as
a
third-party-over
action
or
action-over 
claim.
In
effect,
the
employer’s
exclusive
remedy
protection
is
eroded
by
such
actions
because
the 
liability
is
allocated
back
to
the
employer
through
the
indemnity
clause. 
For
example,
assume
that
the
subcontract
between
Mudpie,
a
mud
contractor,
and
Smooth
Operator 
includes
a
hold
harmless
provision
whereby
Mudpie
agrees
to
hold
Smooth
Operator
harmless
from 
claims
arising
out
of
Mudpie’s
work.
A
mishap
occurs
and
Walter
Wounded,
one
of
Mudpie’s
employees, 
falls
and
is
seriously
injured.
Walter
collects
workers
compensation
benefits
from
Mudpie
and
files
a
suit 
against
Smooth
Operator
for
failure
to
maintain
a
safe
work
environment.
Under
the
indemnification 
agreement,
Mudpie
may
be
required
to
indemnify
Smooth
Operator
for
costs
it
incurs
as
a
result
of
the 
suit.
The
extent
of
Mudpie’s
indemnity
obligation—100
percent,
0
percent,
or
something
in 
between—will
be
determined
by
the
type
of
indemnity
provision
the
contract
contains. 
13Broad
Form
Indemnity
Under
a
broad
form
indemnification
agreement,
the
indemnitor
assumes
an
unqualified
obligation
to
hold 
the
indemnitee
harmless
for
third-party
liabilities
arising
out
of
the
project,
regardless
of
which
party
was 
actually
at
fault.
Even
if
the
damage,
injury,
or
claim
is
due
to
the
sole
negligence
of
the
indemnitee,
the 
indemnitor
must
respond
to
the
loss. 
A
broad
form
provision
shifts
virtually
all
liability
for
third-party
injury
or
damage
arising
out
of
the 
indemnitee’s
involvement
in
the
project
to
the
indemnitor,
including
liability
arising
out
of
the 
indemnitee’s
sole
negligence.
Clearly,
broad
form
indemnity
provides
the
indemnitee
with
strong 
protection
against
losses
arising
out
of
the
project. 
For
the
indemnitor,
however,
broad
form
indemnity
represents
a
significant
assumption
of
risk,
and
many 
parties
will
resist
this
degree
of
risk
transfer.
For
some
contractors,
this
is
a
deal
breaker.
Other 
contractors,
despite
their
objections,
will
accept
these
provisions
because
they
fear
they
will
lose
the
job
if 
they
protest
too
much.
And
in
some
cases,
they
are
correct—some
operators
view
contractors
as 
commodities
and
refuse
to
negotiate
on
key
contract
provisions
because
they
know
there
is
a
contractor 
out
there
that
will
accept
it.
(Whether
the
contractor
has
the
financial
resources
to
actually
fulfill
its 
obligations
is
often
of
secondary
importance
to
such
an
owner.)
At
a
minimum,
contractors
accepting 
broad
form
indemnity
obligations
should
build
an
extra
margin
into
their
bids
to
compensate
for
the
extra 
risk. 
Before
accepting
a
broad
form
indemnity
agreement,
contractors
should
examine
their
liability
insurance 
policies
to
determine
whether
they
have
coverage
to
match
their
contractual
liabilities.
In
some
instances, 
the
contractor’s
contractual
liability
insurance
coverage
may
be
limited
to
liabilities
for
which
the
insured 
contractor
is
at
least
partially
responsible.
In
that
case,
a
contractor
that
accepts
a
broad
form
indemnity 
provision
is
exposing
its
entire
balance
sheet
to
the
satisfaction
of
its
contractual
liabilities. 
Comparative
Form
Indemnity
At
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
is
the
comparative
fault
form
of
indemnity.
As
its
name
implies,
this 
agreement
obligates
the
indemnitor
only
to
the
extent
of
its
own
fault.
For
example,
if
the
indemnitor
was 
20
percent
at
fault
and
the
indemnitee
was
80
percent
at
fault,
the
indemnitee
would
be
entitled
to 
indemnification
of
20
percent
of
its
loss
from
the
indemnitor. 
For
the
indemnitor,
comparative
(limited)
form
indemnity
is
the
most
favorable
type
of
indemnity 
provision.
Each
party
bears
the
risk
of
loss
arising
out
of
its
own
negligence,
which
is
the
same
standard 
applied
under
common
law.
Many
risk
professionals
consider
this
the
most
equitable
allocation
of
risks, 
but
many
indemnitees
view
comparative
form
indemnity
as
inadequate
protection
against
certain
types
of 
claims,
such
as
third-party-over
actions.
Injured
workers
routinely
seek
to
recover
damages
in
excess
of 
their
statutory
workers
compensation
benefits
by
making
a
claim
against
another
party.
Even
if
the
claim 
proves
groundless,
the
cost
of
defending
these
claims
can
be
significant. 
At
first
glance,
it
may
appear
that
the
comparative
fault
form
of
indemnification
does
little
to
increase
a 
contractor’s
liability
beyond
the
general
principles
of
common
law.
However,
the
inclusion
of
a 
comparative
fault
indemnification
provision
does
expand
the
indemnitor’s
exposure
with
regard
to 
employee
injuries.
In
addition
to
its
statutory
liability
for
workers
compensation
benefits,
the
indemnitor 
may
be
responsible
under
the
indemnification
agreement
for
a
portion
of
damages
owed
to
the
employee 
by
another
party.
(See
the
earlier
discussion
of
third-party-over
actions.)
Thus,
even
comparative
fault 
indemnification
represents
an
increase
in
the
contractor’s
liability
under
the
contract. 
Intermediate
Form
Indemnity
An
intermediate
form
indemnity
agreement
represents
a
middle
ground.
Under
this
type
of
agreement,
the 
indemnitor
assumes
responsibility
for
the
indemnitee’s
liabilities
except
where
the
injury
or
damage
is
the 
result
of
the
indemnitee’s
sole
negligence.
Liability
for
damages
is
not
apportioned
according
to
the 
relative
fault
of
each
party.
Any
amount
of
fault
on
the
part
of
the
indemnitor
obligates
the
indemnitor
to 
indemnify
for
the
total
amount
of
damages.
In
other
words,
whether
the
indemnitor
was
10
percent
at 
fault
or
90
percent
at
fault,
it
nevertheless
must
provide
indemnification
for
100
percent
of
the
damages.
14Thus,
under
an
intermediate
form
indemnity
agreement,
a
contractor
would
be
relieved
of
its
contractual 
obligation
to
indemnify
only
when
the
indemnitee
is
solely
at
fault
for
the
loss. 
While
broad
form
indemnity
is
strongly
resisted
by
many
contractors,
intermediate
form
is
generally 
acceptable.
Further,
the
standard
liability
insurance
policies
will
respond
to
this
scope
of
liability
transfer. 
Statutory
Limitations
Most
states
have
statutes
that
restrict
the
contractual
transfer
of
liability
for
one’s
own
negligence
on
the 
grounds
that
it
violates
public
policy.
The
theory
is
that
to
relieve
a
party
of
the
financial
consequences
of 
negligent
or
even
reckless
behavior
weakens
the
incentive
to
exercise
the
appropriate
degree
of
care
to 
prevent
accidents
or
injuries.
The
extent
of
the
indemnification
restrictions
varies
by
state
and
in
some 
cases
by
the
type
of
contract.
Statutes
also
differ
with
respect
to
the
type
of
indemnity
that
is
prohibited, 
with
some
states
prohibiting
any
transfer
of
liability
for
one’s
own
negligence
and
others
prohibiting
only 
the
transfer
of
liability
for
one’s
sole
negligence.
A
few
states
have
no
statute
at
all,
making
broad
form 
indemnity
clauses
permissible. 
Because
state
laws
vary
so
widely,
energy
firms
must
be
aware
of
the
restrictions
that
apply
to
every 
contract
they
sign,
particularly
those
in
which
they
are
the
primary
beneficiary
of
the
indemnification 
provisions
(i.e.,
the
indemnitee).
Courts
are
not
hesitant
to
void
a
clause
that
exceeds
the
statutory 
limitations,
which
means
they
expected
that
risk
allocations
would
be
unenforceable.
Some
contracts 
include
language
providing
that
the
indemnification
agreements
apply
to
the
fullest
extent
provided
by 
state
law.
This
type
of
qualifier
may
avoid
the
nullification
of
the
entire
provision
and
preserve
the
right 
to
indemnification
that
does
not
exceed
the
statute’s
allowable
indemnification. 
Limitation
of
Liability
A
limitation
of
liability
clause
does
not
eliminate
liability
but
merely
limits
it
to
a
predetermined
amount 
or
to
a
specified
type
of
damages.
By
limiting
the
liability
of
the
party
in
whose
favor
it
operates,
the
risk 
of
loss
above
that
limitation
is
transferred
to
the
other
contracting
party. 
The
justification
for
use
of
a
limitation
of
liability
clause
is
simple.
Contractors
and
design
professionals 
commonly
face
liability
exposures
that
far
exceed
the
relatively
small
profit
or
fee
they
receive
for
their 
performance
of
a
contract.
For
example,
a
well
service
contractor
may
have
liability
exposures
in
the 
millions
of
dollars
for
services
for
which
the
contractor
receives
$100,000.
A
limitation
of
liability
clause 
can
equalize
the
imbalance
between
the
potential
benefits
of
undertaking
a
contract
for
services
and
the 
potential
liabilities. 
Types
of
Limitations
Limitation
of
liability
clauses
can
be
categorized
based
on
the
method
by
which
they
limit
liability. 
•
The
most
widely
used
type
of
limitation
puts
a
cap
on
the
amount
of
damages
for
which
a
party
can 
be
held
liable
to
the
other
contracting
party
with
respect
to
its
performance
of
the
contract.
In
many 
instances,
the
limit
is
equal
to
the
fee
received
for
services
performed
or
to
the
amount
of
insurance 
available
to
cover
these
liabilities.
•
In
other
cases,
the
limitation
may
be
a
stipulated
dollar
amount.
•
Another
approach
is
to
limit
a
party’s
liability
with
respect
to
the
type
of
damages
sustained.
For 
example,
contracts
sometimes
contain
a
limitation
of
liability
for
consequential
damages,
such
as 
lost
revenues.
Enforceability
As
with
any
contract
risk
allocation,
in
order
for
the
limitation
of
liability
provision
to
operate
as 
intended,
it
must
be
valid
and
enforceable
from
a
legal
standpoint.
Because
they
often
favor
one
party 
dramatically,
limitation
of
liability
clauses
are
strictly
construed,
and
the
burden
of
clarity
always
resides 
with
the
party
that
obtains
the
benefit
of
the
provision.
Any
ambiguity,
therefore,
could
nullify
the 
limitation
and
expose
its
intended
beneficiary
to
unlimited
liability.
Exhibit
2.2
outlines
the
elements
that
15are
typically
required
for
a
limitation
of
liability
clause
to
be
enforced. 
16Exhibit
2.2
 
Elements
of
an
Enforceable
Limitation
of
Liability
Provision
Opportunity
To
Negotiate
Does
not
require
that
an
actual
negotiation
took 
place
on
this
issue
but
rather
that
both
parties 
had
the
opportunity
to
negotiate.
Limits
of
the
Limitation
The
limitation
must
be
clearly
defined
with 
respect
to
the
amount
or
types
of
damages.
Designation
of
Persons
Covered
The
provision
must
clearly
and
unambiguously 
state
the
parties
to
which
it
applies,
including 
employees,
agents,
or
subcontractors,
if 
applicable.
Failure
to
include
those
acting
on
the 
entity’s
behalf
could
render
the
limitation
of 
liability
clause
useless.
Description
of
Risks
Covered
All
types
of
risks
to
which
the
provision
is 
intended
to
apply
must
be
clearly
and 
unambiguously
set
forth.
Some
firms
draft
their
standard
service
contracts
such
that
their
liability
to
the
other
party
is
limited,
but 
they
include
an
“escape
provision”
under
which
the
other
party
can
elect
to
pay
an
additional
fee
to
avoid 
the
limitation.
The
extra
fee
compensates
the
beneficiary
of
the
provision
for
forgoing
the
limitation
and 
can
be
used
to
purchase
insurance
to
cover
the
risk
or
to
finance
the
retention
of
the
risk.
Courts
tend
to 
enforce
limitation
of
liability
clauses
unless
they
are
statutorily
prohibited. 
Waiver
of
Recovery
Rights/Waiver
of
Subrogation
Sometimes,
in
order
to
ensure
a
transfer
of
risk,
parties
will
waive
their
rights
of
recovery
against
one 
another.
That
is,
they
voluntarily
give
up
their
right
to
pursue
recovery
from
the
other
party
for
amounts 
they
are
legally
entitled
to
collect.
In
some
cases,
this
waiver
is
absolute,
while
in
others,
it
is
conditioned 
on
the
availability
of
insurance
coverage.
In
virtually
all
cases,
the
waiver
is
limited
to
certain
types
of 
damages,
such
as
injuries
to
employees,
damage
to
the
project,
or
consequential
damages.
To
the
extent 
insurance
coverage
applies,
a
party
that
waives
its
right
to
recovery
effectively
waives
the
insurer’s
right 
to
recover
amounts
paid
under
the
policy
from
the
negligent
party—that
is,
the
insurer’s
right
of 
subrogation.
For
this
reason,
these
types
of
provisions
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
“waiver
of 
subrogation
provisions.” 
The
idea
behind
many
of
these
waivers
is
to
confine
responsibility
for
the
specific
types
of
loss
addressed 
to
one
insurance
policy
and
thereby
minimize
the
possibility
of
litigation
between
the
contracting
parties. 
Contractors
must
be
careful
in
agreeing
to
give
up
their
rights
of
recovery
against
other
parties
when
they 
are
relying
on
their
own
insurance
to
cover
the
damages.
While
most
insurance
policies
allow
the
insured 
to
waive
the
insurer’s
subrogation
rights
prior
to
the
occurrence
of
a
loss,
some
policies
prohibit
it.
If
the 
contractor
violates
this
provision,
it
may
forfeit
its
right
to
collect
under
the
policy. 
17Chapter
3
 
Insurance
Requirements
Since
a
promise
to
be
financially
responsible
for
losses
is
only
as
good
as
the
promisor’s
ability
to
fulfill 
its
obligation,
most
indemnitees
(the
parties
that
receive
the
benefit
of
the
risk
transfer)
require 
indemnitors
to
purchase
appropriate
amounts
and
types
of
insurance.
Requiring
certain
coverages
to
be 
purchased
protects
both
parties
against
the
negative
impact
of
losses
on
the
other
party’s
financial 
position
and
thus
its
ability
to
complete
the
contract.
That
is,
the
financial
protection
provided
by
the 
insurance
makes
it
less
likely
that
the
insured
will
encounter
financial
troubles.
This
protects
the 
indemnitee
against
the
risk
of
the
indemnitor’s
default,
which
can
increase
both
the
time
and
cost
of 
completing
the
project.
Likewise,
the
indemnitor
is
protected
against
the
risk
of
nonpayment
for
its
work 
under
the
contract
as
a
result
of
an
uninsured
loss
for
the
indemnitee. 
Most
energy
contracts
therefore
include
a
section
on
insurance
that
outlines
the
coverages
each
party 
agrees
to
provide
with
respect
to
the
project.
These
requirements
stipulate
the
types,
minimum
amounts, 
and
scope
of
coverage
that
are
to
be
purchased.

Contractual
Insurance
Requirements
Exhibit
3.1
summarizes
the
types
of
specifications
that
are
commonly
found
in
a
contract’s
insurance 
requirements. 
18Exhibit

Insurance
Requirements
Specifications
•
Coverages
to

•
Evidence
of
compliance
Because
they
are
designed
to
apply
to
a
variety
of
types
of
projects,
standard
contract
insurance 
requirements
are
not
usually
overly
stringent.
As
a
result,
modifications
and
additions
to
this
section
of
a 
contract
are
commonly
included
in
supplementary
documents. 
Given
the
importance
of
insurance,
it
is
sometimes
surprising
how
little
attention
the
insurance 
requirements
receive
during
contract
negotiations.
Many
operators
and
contractors
forward
this
portion
of 
the
signed
contract
to
their
agent
or
broker
for
review,
but
even
that
basic
step
is
frequently
overlooked. 
The
types
of
insurance
typically
required
in
energy
contracts
are
commercial
general
liability
(CGL) 
insurance,
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance,
and
auto
liability
insurance.
Many 
contracts
also
require
control
of
well
insurance,
which
pays
the
expenses
of
controlling
a
well
that
is
out 
of
control
(a
blowout),
along
with
other
related
costs,
such
as
the
cost
of
redrilling
the
well. 
In
this
section,
we
examine
the
application
of
these
specifications
with
respect
to
each
required
coverage 
line.
Certain
specifications,
including
acceptability
of
insurers,
evidence
of
compliance,
and
waivers
of 
subrogation,
apply
similarly
across
all
coverage
lines
and
therefore
are
addressed
separately
rather
than 
within
each
coverage
section. 
Liability
Insurance
Liability
insurance
serves
two
main
purposes
on
an
exploration
and
drilling
project. 
•
It
provides
some
protection
for
damage
to
the
drilling
rig
or
other
property.
(The
drilling 
contractor’s
insurance
is
the
primary
source
of
recovery
for
damage
to
its
rig,
but
there
might
be 
situations
where
that
policy
will
not
respond.
In
that
instance,
some
coverage
may
be
available 
under
a
service
contractor’s
liability
insurance
policies
if
the
contractor
can
be
held
liable
for
the 
rig’s
damage.)
•
More
importantly,
liability
insurance
provides
protection
against
third-party
bodily
injury
and 
property
damage
claims.
Rather
than
specify
specific
policies
that
must
be
purchased,
some
energy
contracts
stipulate
the
types
of 
claims
for
which
coverage
must
be
provided.
For
example,
each
well
service
contractor
is
generally 
required
to
purchase
coverage
for
claims
involving
injury
to
its
own
employees,
third-party
injury
or 
damage,
claims
arising
out
of
the
contractor’s
use
of
vehicles,
etc.
Further,
contractors
are
routinely 
required
to
ensure
coverage
that
will
respond
to
completed
operations
claims
and
to
their
contractual 
indemnification
obligations.
The
contractor
is
responsible
for
determining
what
coverages
need
to
be 
purchased
to
satisfy
these
requirements.
While
umbrella
liability
insurance
is
not
specifically
required, 
many
contractors
need
this
coverage
to
meet
the
minimum
required
limits.
(Workers
compensation
and 
employers
liability
insurance
cover
a
separate
and
distinct
exposure
and
are
therefore
discussed
separately 
below.) 
Who
Is
Covered
19Liability
insurance
policies
cover
the
named
insured
(the
party
purchasing
the
coverage)
as
well
as
certain 
other
categories
of
insureds,
such
as
employees
and
stockholders.
Liability
policies
also
allow
many
other 
parties
to
be
added
as
“additional
insureds.”
Indemnitees
under
energy
contracts
routinely
require 
additional
insured
status
under
indemnitors’
liability
policies. 
Additional
insured
status
serves
as
a
backup
to
the
indemnity
agreement,
in
which
the
indemnitor
agrees 
to
hold
the
indemnitee
harmless
for
claims
brought
against
the
indemnitee
party
for
damages
arising
out 
of
the
operations
involved
in
the
contract.
That
is,
even
if
a
court
declares
the
hold
harmless
agreement 
void,
the
indemnitee,
as
an
insured
under
the
indemnitor’s
policy,
can
submit
the
claim
directly
to
the 
indemnitor’s
insurer.
Additional
insured
status
also
guarantees
a
defense
for
such
claims,
the
cost
of 
which
is
outside
the
policy
limits. 
For
liability
coverages,
the
required
limits
will
vary
based
on
the
size
of
the
project,
the
nature
of
the 
project,
and
the
specific
trade(s)
involved.
Because
of
this
variation,
liability
limits
are
usually
stipulated 
in
supplementary
provisions
rather
than
in
the
basic
contract. 
Minimum
Scope
of
Coverage
Sometimes
a
standard
policy
form
will
be
specified
as
a
minimum
acceptable
scope
of
coverage.
Because 
some
insurers
use
adapted
versions
of
standard
forms
and
use
an
internal
numbering
system,
this
type
of 
requirement
will
usually
specify
only
that
the
scope
of
coverage
must
be
“at
least
as
broad
as”
the 
standard
form
and
will
typically
include
the
applicable
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO),
form 
number
and
edition
date
to
clarify
the
expected
scope
of
coverage.
For
example,
if
the
policy
specifies 
that
the
CGL
policy
must
be
a
standard
CG
00
01
04
13
form
or
equivalent,
the
contractor
is
required
to 
purchase
a
policy
that
provides
coverage
that
is
at
least
as
broad
as
the
April
2013
edition
of
the
ISO 
occurrence-based
CGL
policy.
(The
edition
is
specified
by
04
13,
and
the
occurrence
trigger
is
specified 
by
form
number
00
01.) 
As
stated
above,
the
liability
insurance
requirement
may
not
require
specific
policies
but
instead
stipulate 
that
the
policy
must
provide
coverage
for
certain
types
of
claims,
such
as
completed
operations
claims 
and
contractual
liability
claims. 
Virtually
all
unmodified
CGL
policies
automatically
include
these
coverages.
However,
it
is
possible
to 
remove
completed
operations
or
contractual
liability
coverages
by
endorsement.
Stipulating
that
the 
policy
must
provide
such
coverages
puts
the
onus
on
the
contractor
to
make
sure
the
coverages
exist
on
its 
policies
or
else
be
in
breach
of
the
contract. 
Contractors
are
frequently
required
to
make
other
parties
additional
insureds
under
their
liability
policies. 
The
primary
purposes
of
requiring
additional
insured
status
are
to
provide
a
backup
to
the
indemnity 
provision
and
to
obtain
a
right
to
an
insurer-provided
defense
against
claims.
The
scope
of
coverage
under 
standard
and
nonstandard
additional
insured
endorsements
has
been
significantly
reduced
over
the
past
2 
decades.
In
1993,
the
additional
insured’s
coverage
for
completed
operations
claims
was
removed,
and
in 
2004,
coverage
for
injury
or
damage
caused
by
the
additional
insured’s
sole
negligence
was
removed. 
Additional
insured
coverage
for
completed
operations
requires
a
separate
endorsement,
which
is
available 
at
the
insurer’s
option.
The
2013
editions
of
standard
additional
insured
endorsements
limit
the
additional 
insured’s
coverage
to
the
lesser
of
the
policy
limit
or
the
amount
of
coverage
required
in
the
contract. 
Duration
of
Coverage
CGL
insurance
is
typically
required
for
the
duration
of
the
project
and
for
a
period
of
years
after
the 
project
has
been
completed.
That
is,
the
contractor
is
required
to
continue
to
carry
CGL
insurance
for
a 
stipulated
period
of
time.
This
requirement
reflects
the
fact
that
claims
arising
out
of
the
work
performed 
on
the
project
may
not
arise
until
well
after
the
project
is
completed.
Requiring
liability
insurance
that 
applies
to
the
completed
project
improves
the
odds
that
there
will
be
insurance
to
respond
to
the
claim. 
In
some
cases,
a
contractor
may
be
required
to
provide
completed
operations
coverage
until
the
applicable 
statute
of
repose
expires.
(A
statute
of
repose
stipulates
a
point
in
time
at
which
a
contractor’s
liability 
ends
for
some
or
all
claims
alleging
defective
construction.
Statutes
of
repose
vary
from
4
to
20
years, 
depending
on
the
jurisdiction.)
20Policyholders
automatically
have
coverage
for
their
completed
operations
liability
under
their
ongoing 
CGL
policy
as
long
as
there
is
no
completed
operations
exclusion
on
the
policy.
However,
to
the
extent 
the
completed
operations
coverage
requirement
applies
to
coverage
for
the
additional
insured,
some 
contractors
may
not
be
able
to
meet
this
requirement
because
their
insurer
is
not
willing
to
extend
this 
coverage
to
additional
insureds. 
Auto
liability
insurance
is
generally
required
only
until
the
project
is
completed.
This
is
consistent
with 
the
nature
of
the
exposure.
(That
is,
the
exposure
is
tied
to
the
contractor’s
presence
on
the
site.) 
Order
of
Payment
While
the
indemnitee’s
CGL
policy
will
respond
on
its
behalf
to
claims
arising
out
of
the
indemnitor’s 
work
on
its
behalf,
the
indemnitee’s
objective
is
to
keep
such
claims
out
of
its
own
insurance
program
to 
the
extent
possible.
Consequently,
the
indemnitee
will
normally
take
steps
to
make
sure
its
own
liability 
insurance
is
“coverage
of
last
resort”—that
is,
the
indemnitee’s
insurance
will
be
excess
and
will
only
be 
triggered
after
the
indemnitor’s
policies
have
paid
their
full
limit
of
insurance. 
Some
contracts
stipulate
that
the
indemnitor’s
liability
insurance
must
be
“primary
and
noncontributory” 
with
respect
to
its
work
under
the
contract.
(“Primary”
indicates
it
pays
before
other
applicable
coverage, 
and
“noncontributory”
means
the
insurer
will
not
seek
contribution
from
other
policies
that
are
also 
triggered
by
a
given
loss.)
Standard
CGL
and
auto
liability
policies
meet
these
criteria.
However,
if
both 
the
policy
on
which
the
entity
is
an
additional
insured
and
the
policy
on
which
it
is
the
named
insured
(its 
own
policy)
provide
that
they
are
primary,
disputes
could
arise
as
to
the
order
of
payment. 
The
standard
ISO
CGL
policy
addresses
this
apparent
conflict
by
stipulating
that
the
policy
is
excess
with 
respect
to
other
insurance
available
to
the
named
insured
as
an
additional
insured
under
another
policy. 
This
language
avoids
the
instance
where
both
policies
claim
to
be
primary
and
provides
a
clear
order
of 
payment.
Some
nonstandard
policies,
or
older
editions
of
the
standard
policies,
might
not
include
the 
clarifying
language
with
respect
to
additional
insureds.
In
that
instance,
contractors
should
request
this 
type
of
modification
from
their
own
insurers.
Because
it
reduces
the
insurer’s
exposure,
there
should
be 
no
resistance
to
the
change. 
Some
insurers
resist
adding
“primary
and
noncontributory”
language
to
their
additional
insured 
endorsements
because
they
want
to
preserve
their
right
to
seek
contribution
from
the
policies
of
third 
parties
under
which
the
additional
insured
may
also
have
the
same
status.
An
operator,
for
example,
may 
be
an
additional
insured
under
the
CGL
policy
of
every
contractor.
When
multiple
contractors
share 
responsibility
for
injury
or
damage
that
imposes
liability
on
the
operator,
then
an
insurer
that
has
paid
a 
claim
on
behalf
of
its
additional
insured
operator
could—and
arguably
should—be
able
to
recover
a 
portion
of
the
paid
damages
from
other
insurers
that
have
also
made
the
operator
an
additional
insured. 
This
process
would
not
force
the
operator’s
own
CGL
policy
to
contribute
to
the
settlement
of
the
claim, 
but
it
would
mean
that
the
additional
insured
coverage
in
question
was
not
strictly
“noncontributory.” 
ISO’s
“Primary
and
Noncontributory
Endorsement”
(CG
20
01),
which
was
introduced
in
2013,
enables 
CGL
insureds
to
evidence
compliance
with
contractual
obligations
in
which
they
might
have
to
provide 
another
party
with
additional
insured
coverage
that
is
“primary
and
noncontributory.”
This
endorsement 
states—reiterates,
really—that
the
coverage
provided
to
the
additional
insured
is
on
a
primary
basis. 
However,
it
further
states
that
the
insurer
will
not
seek
contribution
from
any
other
insurance
under
which 
the
additional
insured
is
a
named
insured—in
other
words,
it
will
not
seek
to
force
the
additional 
insured’s
own
CGL
insurer
to
contribute
to
the
settlement
or
payment
of
a
covered
claim.
This
limitation 
would
not
prevent
the
insurer
from
seeking
contribution
from
another
policy
under
which
its
additional 
insured
may
also
have
additional
insured
status. 
Deductibles
Some
contracts
may
stipulate
a
maximum
liability
insurance
deductible,
usually
in
the
supplementary 
provisions.
On
the
surface,
an
indemnitee’s
concern
over
this
point
is
understandable.
A
contractor
that
is 
retaining
more
risk
than
it
can
afford
jeopardizes
its
ability
to
fulfill
its
contractual
obligations.
Further,
as 
an
additional
insured
under
the
policy,
the
indemnitee
might
want
to
limit
the
deductible
that
may
apply
21with
respect
to
a
claim
against
its
company.
As
outlined
below,
in
most
cases,
the
first
concern
above
can 
be
overcome
and
the
second
usually
has
no
legitimate
basis.
Therefore,
contractors
that
have
a
large 
liability
deductible
in
place
can
often
negotiate
the
deductible
limitation
out
of
the
contract. 
The
first
of
the
concerns
stated
above
can
be
legitimate—that
is,
contractors
that
retain
more
risk
may
be 
more
susceptible
to
financial
fluctuations.
However,
that
is
not
a
given
and
is
insufficient
reason
alone
to 
prohibit
a
deductible.
Large,
well-capitalized
companies
may
be
perfectly
able
to
absorb
deductibles
of 
$500,000
or
more.
Because
it
relies
on
the
contractor’s
ability
to
reimburse
it
for
the
deductible,
the 
insurance
company
typically
verifies
the
contractor’s
financial
condition
before
agreeing
to
a
large 
deductible.
Indemnitees
also
benefit
from
this
aspect
of
the
insurer’s
underwriting
process.
The
deductible 
also
reduces
the
premiums
associated
with
the
contractor’s
insurance
program,
which
will
be
reflected
in 
the
bid
price
for
the
contract.
Lastly,
contractors’
policies
are
not
purchased
specifically
for
each
project 
but
rather
on
an
annual
basis,
and
asking
a
contractor
to,
in
effect,
renegotiate
its
insurance
program 
midterm
is
simply
unreasonable. 
The
argument
that
a
party
is
concerned
about
deductibles
applicable
to
claims
against
it
as
an
additional 
insured
generally
has
no
valid
basis
when
the
standard
endorsement
is
used
to
impose
the
deductible.
The 
standard
liability
deductible
endorsement
provides
that
the
deductible
applies
only
to
damages
paid
on
the 
named
insured’s
behalf.
Coverage
for
other
insureds,
including
additional
insureds,
is
not
subject
to
the 
deductible
provision.
As
long
as
the
endorsement
follows
the
standard
endorsement
language,
additional 
insureds
have
no
legitimate
concern
over
this
point.
As
a
practical
matter,
even
if
the
additional
insured’s 
coverage
were
subject
to
a
deductible,
the
contractor
is
usually
still
responsible
for
indemnifying
that 
party,
so
the
contractor’s
CGL
insurer
would
likely
end
up
paying
the
deductible
amount
in
the
form
of
a 
contractual
liability
claim. 
Of
course,
nonstandard
endorsements
that
apply
differently
can
be
used,
and
this
may
be
a
concern. 
However,
this
must
be
balanced
against
the
unreasonableness
of
requiring
a
contractor
to
renegotiate
its 
insurance
program
midstream
to
protect
against
a
relatively
unlikely
event.
Rather
than
addressing
this 
issue
with
a
contract
provision
requiring
no
deductible
exist,
it
is
probably
a
better
approach
to
discuss
the 
issue
with
the
contractor,
determine
how
its
policy
is
structured,
and,
if
necessary,
simply
include
a 
contract
requirement
that
the
contractor
will
reimburse
any
deductibles
imposed
on
the
additional
insured 
by
the
insurer. 
Workers
Compensation
and
Employers
Liability
Insurance
There
are
several
reasons
an
upstream
party
would
require
a
downstream
contractor
to
purchase
workers 
compensation
insurance. 
•
If
the
upstream
party
is
another
contractor,
most
state
laws
will
require
its
insurer
to
pay
workers 
compensation
benefits
to
injured
employees
of
its
uninsured
subcontractor.
•
If
an
injured
employee
has
any
concern
about
being
taken
care
of
following
his
or
her
injury,
as 
would
be
the
case
if
a
contractor
did
not
have
insurance,
he
or
she
is
much
more
likely
to
retain
an 
attorney.
This
substantially
increases
the
possibility
of
a
suit
against
the
upstream
party.
•
Uninsured
claims
against
a
downstream
contractor
may
impair
its
financial
position,
which
would 
increase
the
risk
that
it
will
not
be
able
to
meet
its
project
responsibilities.
Therefore,
most
contracts
require
contractors
to
provide
coverage
for
statutory
benefits
payable
to
injured 
employees
as
well
as
coverage
for
those
rare
circumstances
when
they
(or
their
families)
may
bring
a
tort 
action
against
their
employer.
The
standard
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance 
covers
both
of
these
types
of
claims.
The
workers
compensation
portion
of
the
policy
covers
benefits 
payable
under
covered
statutes,
and
the
employers
liability
section
covers
other
claims
arising
out
of 
injuries
to
employees,
such
as
injuries
not
covered
by
the
statute
or
claims
brought
by
a
relative
of
the 
injured
employee. 
In
some
instances,
the
contract
insurance
requirements
will
not
include
a
separate
section
for
workers 
compensation
coverage.
Rather,
the
exposures
are
included
in
the
list
of
liabilities
for
which
contractors 
are
required
to
provide
coverage.

Who
Is
Covered
Workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance
covers
the
named
insured
employer
for 
liabilities
arising
out
of
injuries
to
its
employees.
Because
coverage
is
based
on
statutory
obligations, 
other
parties
are
not
normally
added
to
the
policy
as
insureds
because
they
have
no
statutory
obligation 
for
such
injuries.
Thus,
there
should
be
no
requirement
for
additional
insured
status
with
respect
to 
workers
compensation
insurance. 
Minimum
Limits
of
Coverage
Workers
compensation
insurance
is
generally
written
on
a
“statutory”
basis.
The
policy
will
pay
whatever 
benefits
the
applicable
workers
compensation
statute
prescribes.
Therefore,
no
specific
dollar
limit
of 
coverage
is
required
in
the
contract.
Rather,
the
contract
will
require
the
contractor
to
provide
coverage 
equal
to
its
statutory
liabilities. 
Even
though
the
contract
may
not
specifically
reference
them,
this
requirement
usually
reaches
special 
workers
compensation
benefits
payable
under
federal
statutes,
such
as
maritime.
The
basic
workers 
compensation
policy
will
not
cover
benefits
payable
under
federal
acts
unless
endorsed
to
do
so.
It
is
up 
to
the
contractor
and
its
insurance
professional
to
determine
whether
these
statutes
apply
and
arrange
the 
appropriate
coverages. 
A
minimum
limit
of
insurance
will
apply
to
employers
liability
coverage,
which
is
written
in
conjunction 
with
the
statutory
workers
compensation
coverage.
The
standard
limits
are
as
follows. 
$100,000
Bodily
injury
by
accident—each
accident
$100,000
Bodily
injury
by
disease—each
employee
$500,000
Bodily
injury
by
disease—policy
limit
24These
limits
are
frequently
increased
to
$500,000/$500,000/$500,000.
In
many
instances,
the
contractor 
will
carry
an
umbrella
policy
that
supplements
the
employers
liability
insurance
limits.
In
that
case,
the 
umbrella
limits
should
be
allowed
to
satisfy
the
contractually
required
limits
of
insurance. 
Minimum
Scope
of
Coverage
As
noted
earlier,
liability
insurance
requirements
often
address
the
types
of
claims
for
which
coverage
is 
required
rather
than
specific
types
of
insurance
policies
that
must
be
purchased.
For
example,
the
contract 
might
specify
that
coverage
must
be
provided
for
damages
associated
with
bodily
injury,
sickness, 
disease,
or
death
of
the
contractor’s
employee.
The
standard
workers
compensation
and
employers 
liability
insurance
policy
provides
coverage
that
satisfies
this
requirement,
including
coverage
for
claims 
brought
by
a
third
party,
such
as
the
spouse
or
child
of
the
injured
employee. 
Note
that
the
employers
liability
portion
of
the
policy
contains
an
exclusion
for
liabilities
assumed
in
a 
contract;
therefore,
it
will
not
respond
to
the
contractor’s
obligation
to
indemnify
another
party
with 
respect
to
an
injury
to
the
contractor’s
employee.
This
avoids
an
overlap
in
coverage
between
the
workers 
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
and
the
CGL
policy. 
Duration
of
Coverage
Workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance
is
required
only
through
the
completion
of
the 
project.
This
is
consistent
with
the
contracting
party’s
interest
in
the
contractor’s
financial
stability. 
Order
of
Payment
The
contract
may
stipulate
that
this
coverage
is
to
be
primary
and
noncontributory,
but
overlapping 
coverage
is
of
little
concern
in
this
line
of
coverage.
The
standard
policy
provisions
are
adequate
for 
handling
this
concern. 
Deductibles
Some
contracts
may
stipulate
a
maximum
workers
compensation
deductible,
usually
in
the
supplementary 
provisions.
Insurers
typically
scrutinize
the
contractor’s
financial
condition
before
agreeing
to
a
large 
deductible.
Indemnitees
also
benefit
from
this
aspect
of
the
insurer’s
underwriting
process. 
Workers
compensation
insurance
is
not
purchased
specifically
for
each
project
but
rather
on
an
annual 
basis.
Insurance
requirements
that
force
a
contractor
to
change
its
insurance
program
midterm,
which
is 
difficult,
time
consuming,
and
potentially
expensive,
are
simply
unreasonable.
As
a
result,
deductible 
limitations
should
not
normally
be
included
in
the
insurance
requirements;
contractors
can
sometimes 
negotiate
changes
in
these
requirements
as
needed. 
Acceptable
Insurance
Companies
An
insurance
policy
is
only
as
reliable
as
the
insurance
company’s
ability
to
honor
its
obligations
under 
the
policy.
Most
contracts,
therefore,
provide
the
upstream
party
with
some
level
of
control
over
the 
insurer
used
by
the
downstream
party.
In
its
simplest
form,
it
might
merely
state
that
the
insurer
must
be 
acceptable
to
the
upstream
party
without
defining
what
“acceptable”
is.
However,
it
is
probably
more 
common
to
stipulate
that
contractually
required
coverages
must
be
purchased
from
an
insurance
company 
with
at
least
a
specified
financial
rating,
such
as
an
A-
or
better
Best’s
rating.
(A.M.
Best
is
a
well-known 
insurance
company
rating
organization.) 
Some
contractors
may
have
difficulty
meeting
this
requirement
due
to
a
lack
of
available
markets.
In 
some
instances,
availability
issues
affect
individual
contractors
(e.g.,
due
to
poor
loss
experience),
and
in 
others,
they
affect
entire
market
segments
(e.g.,
due
to
a
broad
scale
underwriting
withdrawal
from
certain 
classes
of
contractors).
Thus,
upstream
parties
need
to
be
cognizant
of
the
marketplace
and
willing
to
be 
flexible
when
necessary. 
Certificates
of
Insurance
The
most
common
method
of
obtaining
evidence
of
compliance
with
the
contract
insurance
requirements
25is
to
require
a
certificate
of
insurance.
Standard
certificates
of
insurance
allow
the
contractor’s
insurance 
representative
(usually
the
agent
or
broker)
to
provide
confirmation
that
property
or
liability
coverages
are 
in
effect
at
the
time
the
certificate
is
issued,
including
the
coverage
period
and
limits
of
insurance.
When 
an
indemnitee
has
asked
to
be
added
as
an
insured
to
the
indemnitor’s
policy,
compliance
with
that 
request
can
also
be
indicated
on
the
certificate. 
Beyond
these
basic
data,
insurance
certificates
provide
very
limited
information
about
the
actual
scope
of 
coverage
available
in
the
policies.
For
example,
while
certificates
indicate
the
limits
carried,
they
do
not 
reveal
whether
prior
or
pending
claims
have
been
made
under
the
policy,
which
would
reduce
the
amount 
of
remaining
coverage
available
to
pay
claims
arising
out
of
the
certificate
holder’s
project;
nor
do
they 
necessarily
indicate
exclusions
or
other
limitations
in
the
policy
that
could
restrict
the
scope
of
coverage 
available.
Further,
in
most
instances,
the
certificate
is
merely
a
documentation
of
coverage—it
does
not 
actually
create
coverage
or
impose
duties
on
the
insurer
that
do
not
already
exist
in
the
policies
it 
represents.
An
error
on
the
certificate
is
usually
not
binding
on
the
insurance
company. 
Indemnitees
sometimes
try
to
improve
the
quality
and
enforceability
of
information
they
obtain
on
the 
certificate
by
requiring
that
disclaimer
language
be
stricken,
notice
of
cancellation
provisions
be
altered, 
and
a
variety
of
other
modifications
to
the
certificate
language
be
made.
Some
indemnitees
throw
out
the 
standard
certificates
altogether
and
require
contractors
to
have
their
insurance
representative
fill
out
a 
certificate
created
specifically
for
their
own
use
that
strengthens
their
legal
position
with
regard
to
the 
information
provided
on
the
certificate.
Unfortunately,
contractors
are
not
always
able
to
comply
with
this 
request
because
their
insurance
companies
frequently
refuse
to
be
a
party
to
them. 
General
Considerations
In
their
desire
to
ensure
adequate
protection
for
their
risks,
indemnitees
sometimes
attempt
to
impose 
overly
strict
insurance
requirements.
Unfortunately,
all
they
usually
accomplish
is
to
create
more 
difficulty
in
the
contracting
process
(e.g.,
obtaining
bids
that
comply
with
the
specifications),
to
increase 
the
incidence
of
contractor
breach
of
contract,
and
to
increase
legal
costs. 
Problematic
exclusions
cannot
always
be
overcome
by
requiring
contractors
to
delete
the
exclusions
from 
their
policies,
because
the
insurers
may
not
grant
these
requests.
Examples
of
exclusions
insurers
will 
rarely,
if
ever,
modify
to
broaden
the
scope
of
CGL
coverage
include
the
faulty
workmanship
exclusion 
and
the
pollution
exclusion.
To
require
contractors
to
modify
their
CGL
insurance
to
cover
these
risks
is 
to
virtually
ensure
a
breach
of
contract.
Even
if
the
required
modifications
are
technically
obtainable,
the 
price
may
be
more
than
the
parties
are
willing
to
pay. 
Out-of-date
terminology
in
the
contract’s
insurance
requirements
is
a
common
problem.
For
example, 
although
the
comprehensive
general
liability
form
was
withdrawn
in
1986
and
replaced
with
the 
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
form,
many
contracts
still
require
“comprehensive
general
liability 
insurance.”
(Some
may
even
require
older
forms
of
coverage,
such
as
“manufacturers
and
contractors 
(M&C),”
“owners,
landlords,
and
tenants
(OL&T),”
or
“public
liability
insurance”;
the
latter
term
has
not 
been
used
since
the
early
1950s.)
Further,
a
number
of
coverages
that
once
required
endorsements—for 
example,
contractual
liability,
broad
form
property
damage,
and
personal
and
advertising
injury 
liability—are
now
automatically
provided
by
the
standard
CGL
policy
unless
they
are
excluded
by 
endorsement.
Nevertheless,
some
contracts
still
require
that
the
CGL
policy
include
the
old
endorsements. 
Use
of
outdated
terminology
confuses
and
complicates
the
contracting
process.
Someone
with
knowledge 
of
current
insurance
markets,
such
as
the
agent
or
broker,
should
periodically
review
contracts
and
update 
them
to
reflect
current
terminology
and
methods
of
providing
coverage.

liability

Waivers
of
Subrogation
Virtually
all
property
insurance
policies
and
most
liability
insurance
policies
contain
a
subrogation
clause. 
This
clause
entitles
the
insurer,
once
it
has
paid
a
claim,
to
exercise
its
insured’s
right
of
recovery
against 
a
third
party
that
caused
or
contributed
to
the
loss. 
In
property
insurance,
it
is
generally
recognized
that
the
insurer
has
this
right
even
if
it
is
not
specifically 
set
out
in
the
policy.
The
theory
behind
this
is
quite
logical.
Once
the
insured
has
been
“made
whole”
for 
its
loss,
it
no
longer
has
any
reason
to
try
to
recover
the
damages
from
the
negligent
party
that
caused
the 
loss.
In
such
a
case,
the
insurer
stands
in
the
insured’s
shoes
after
paying
the
claim
and
assumes
the 
insured’s
right
to
recover
the
amount
it
paid
its
insured
from
the
negligent
party. 
Policy
Subrogation
Provisions
Technically
speaking,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
is
an
agreement
by
the
insurer
not
to
pursue
recovery
from 
a
negligent
third
party.
Practically
speaking,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
is
an
agreement
between
two 
contracting
parties
to
allocate
certain
losses
to
the
insurer.
That
is,
one
party
waives
its
right
of
recovery 
against
the
other
contracting
party
with
respect
to
specified
losses.
Because
the
first
party’s
right
of 
recovery
has
been
waived,
that
party’s
insurer’s
right
to
subrogate,
which
derives
from
the
insured’s
right 
of
recovery,
has
also
been
effectively
waived. 
For
most
coverage
lines,
insurers
are
generally
willing
to
waive
their
subrogation
rights,
to
a
certain 
extent,
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
contracting
parties
want
the
ability
to
allocate
risks
in
this
manner. 
However,
requiring
a
waiver
of
subrogation
in
the
energy
contract
may
not
be
sufficient
to
effect
a
waiver 
of
subrogation
in
the
insurance
policy.
As
demonstrated
in
Exhibit
3.4,
most
insurance
policies
place
27limits
on
the
insured’s
ability
to
waive
subrogation
without
the
insurer’s
consent.
Some
policies 
absolutely
prohibit
the
insured
from
doing
anything
that
interferes
with
the
insurer’s
subrogation
rights. 
Policyholders
that
violate
this
policy
condition
may
forfeit
the
coverage
they
have
under
the
policy
with 
respect
to
such
a
claim.
On
these
types
of
policies,
the
underwriter’s
consent
should
be
sought
prior
to 
executing
the
contract.
If
the
underwriter
agrees,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
would
be
required 
to
alter
the
provision
and
demonstrate
the
insurer’s
consent.

For
standard
coverage
lines,
this
chart
describes
the
approach
taken
in
the
standard
form,
which 
most
insurers
will
follow.
However,
even
in
standard
lines,
insurers
sometimes
use
their
own
forms, 
which
could
include
different
subrogation
language.
2
For
nonstandard
coverage
lines,
the
approach
will
vary
more
significantly.
This
chart
describes
the 
most
common
approach,
but
the
policy
should
be
checked
carefully
for
the
exact
language.
Other
policies
only
prohibit
the
waiver
of
subrogation
rights
after
a
loss
occurs.
That
is,
these
policies 
allow
the
insured
to
waive
its
rights
of
recovery,
and
thus
the
insurer’s
right
to
subrogate,
as
long
as
the 
waiver
is
given
before
the
loss
occurs.
Some
policies
explicitly
state
that
pre-loss
waivers
of
subrogation 
are
permitted,
while
others
merely
prohibit
the
insured
from
doing
anything
after
a
loss
that
would
impair 
the
insurer’s
subrogation
rights.
By
long-standing
industry
consensus,
both
of
these
types
of
subrogation 
provisions
allow
the
insured
to
waive
recovery
rights
against
others
prior
to
loss.
Contractors
can 
therefore
agree
in
a
contract
to
waive
their
rights
of
recovery
with
respect
to
covered
losses
without 
jeopardizing
their
recovery
under
that
policy—as
long
as
the
contract
is
executed
before
the
loss
occurs. 
In
recent
years,
some
insurers
have
challenged
whether
the
“shall
do
nothing
after
a
loss”
language
does, 
in
fact,
grant
permission
for
pre-loss
waivers
of
subrogation
by
the
insured.
While
the
courts
have
largely
29held
that
it
does,
there
is
always
a
risk
that
specific
facts
may
lead
a
particular
court
in
another
direction. 
For
this
reason,
it
is
wise
to
discuss
this
issue
with
underwriters
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
wish 
to
be
notified
of
waivers
of
subrogation.
Most
underwriters
with
a
large
book
of
energy
business 
understand
that
this
is
a
typical
risk
transfer
tactic
and
will
allow
contractors
to
waive
subrogation
without 
specific
underwriter
consent
or
notification.
A
subrogation
provision
that
affirmatively
grants
the
insured 
this
right
will
avoid
potential
coverage
disputes
on
this
point. 
The
bottom
line
is
that
each
contractor
is
responsible
for
knowing
whether
any
additional
steps
are 
required
to
effect
a
waiver
of
subrogation
as
agreed
to
in
a
construction
contract.
Exhibit
3.4
summarizes 
how
various
types
of
policies
typically
address
the
waiver
of
subrogation
issue
and
provides 
recommendations
for
securing
an
effective
waiver
of
subrogation
under
that
type
of
provision.
See
the 
discussion
below
for
more
information
on
specific
coverage
lines. 
General
Liability
and
Auto
Policies
Standard
CGL
policies
and
business
auto
policies
contain
the
“must
do
nothing
after
loss”
language 
described
above.
Most
nonstandard
policies
do
likewise.
Thus,
waivers
of
subrogation
with
respect
to 
damages
payable
under
these
policies
do
not
void
the
insured’s
coverage
as
long
as
the
contract
with
the 
waiver
was
executed
before
a
loss
occurred. 
Standard
liability
insurance
specifications
usually
do
not
require
that
a
waiver
of
subrogation 
endorsement
be
added
to
the
policy.
However,
there
may
be
provisions
elsewhere
in
the
contract
in
which 
one
party
waives
its
right
of
recovery
against
the
other
party.
In
that
instance,
the
insurer
is
prevented 
from
pursuing
subrogation
to
the
extent
the
waiver
applies. 
Further
protection
against
subrogation
actions
is
provided
if
the
party
seeking
the
waiver
is
an
additional 
insured
under
the
policy.
(Insurers
are
not
permitted
to
subrogate
against
their
own
insureds
as
that
would 
violate
the
purpose
of
insurance.)
Despite
the
automatic
protections
against
subrogation
by
liability 
insurers,
sometimes
a
party
that
receives
the
benefit
of
a
waiver
of
recovery
rights
will
insist
on
evidence 
that
the
insurer
agrees
not
to
subrogate
against
that
party.
A
standard
endorsement
is
available
for
this 
purpose. 
Workers
Compensation
While
waivers
of
subrogation
are
routinely
used
for
many
types
of
claims,
workers
compensation
waivers 
of
subrogation
create
some
unusual
and
interesting
problems. 
Workers
compensation
benefits
are
statutory
and
are
payable
to
injured
employees
for
covered
injuries 
without
regard
to
fault.
In
exchange
for
these
guaranteed
benefits,
employees
give
up
their
right
to
pursue 
claims
against
the
employer
outside
the
amounts
payable
under
the
workers
compensation
act.
However, 
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
well
services
contractor’s
employee
from
bringing
an
action
against
an 
upstream
party,
such
as
the
oil
operator
or
the
drilling
contractor,
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
injury, 
even
if
the
workers
compensation
benefits
covered
the
employee’s
damages
in
full.
In
some
states, 
amounts
paid
under
the
workers
compensation
act
are
not
even
deducted
from
amounts
awarded
to
the 
injured
employee
in
an
action
against
a
third
party. 
The
standard
workers
compensation
policy
published
by
the
National
Council
on
Compensation 
Insurance
(NCCI)
contains
multiple
subrogation
provisions—one
under
each
section
of
the
policy
and 
another
in
the
general
conditions.
Unfortunately,
inconsistent
wording
creates
some
confusion
regarding 
an
insured’s
ability
to
waive
the
insurer’s
right
of
subrogation.
To
be
safe,
always
obtain
a
waiver
of 
subrogation
endorsement
from
the
workers
compensation
insurer
before
a
contractor
signs
a
contract
that 
includes
a
workers
compensation
waiver
of
subrogation
provision. 
The
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy’s
general
conditions
state
that
the
insured
must 
do
nothing
after
a
loss
that
would
interfere
with
the
insurer’s
subrogation
rights.
This
would
appear
to
be 
similar
to
the
provisions
in
the
CGL
policy
and
business
auto
policies
(BAPs).
However,
within
the 
individual
coverage
parts
(Part
One,
which
provides
coverage
for
statutory
workers
compensation 
benefits,
and
Part
Two,
which
provides
coverage
for
other
claims
associated
with
an
employee
injury)
are 
additional
provisions
that
state
the
insured
must
do
“
everything
necessary”
to
protect
the
insurer’s
rights
30of
recovery
and
to
help
enforce
them.
There
is
no
wording
in
this
condition
to
make
it
applicable
only 
after
a
loss
has
occurred.
To
avoid
a
coverage
dispute,
the
safest
strategy
for
waiving
the
insurer’s 
subrogation
rights
is
to
have
a
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
attached
to
the
workers
compensation 
policy. 
Waivers
of
subrogation
are
much
more
controversial
in
workers
compensation
than
in
most
other
lines
of 
coverage
because
they
result
in
an
increased
exposure
for
contractors
and
present
an
opportunity
for 
injured
workers
to
recover
more
than
their
actual
losses.
In
all
states,
workers
compensation
insurers
are 
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
the
injured
employee
with
regard
to
recovery
against
a
negligent
third
party. 
For
example,
if
an
injured
employee
collects
workers
compensation
benefits
from
the
employer’s
insurer 
and
then
files
a
lawsuit
against
the
oil
operator
(not
his
or
her
employer)
for
failure
to
warn
of
known 
hazards,
the
workers
compensation
insurer
is
allowed
to
collect
what
it
already
paid
for
those
injuries 
from
any
recovery
obtained
from
the
negligent
project
owner.
This
prevents
the
injured
employee
from 
recovering
twice
for
the
same
elements
of
loss,
such
as
medical
expenses
or
lost
wages.
However,
if
the 
workers
compensation
insurer’s
right
to
subrogate
has
been
waived
by
the
insured,
it
cannot
recover
such 
amounts
from
the
third-party
suit. 
The
strongest
argument
for
requiring
a
workers
compensation
waiver
of
subrogation
from
a
downstream 
party
is
that
it
prevents
the
insurer
from
initiating
a
subrogation
action
on
its
own—that
is,
when
no
action 
has
been
filed
against
the
owner
by
the
injured
employee.
Practically
speaking,
however,
most
serious 
injuries
do
result
in
third-party
lawsuits;
therefore,
it
is
somewhat
rare
for
a
workers
compensation
insurer 
to
pursue
subrogation
on
its
own.
The
primary
argument
against
requiring
a
waiver
is
that
it
can
be 
difficult
and
costly
to
obtain,
yet
when
all
is
said
and
done,
it
provides
little
protection
to
the
owner 
beyond
what
is
already
provided
in
the
contract.
That
is,
the
waiver
does
nothing
to
prevent
the
injured 
employee
from
filing
an
action
against
the
owner,
and
it
does
not
reduce
the
owner’s
exposure
for
this 
type
of
injury
even
if
the
loss
is
outside
the
indemnification
agreement.
It
is
merely
a
question
of
whether 
the
full
amount
is
paid
to
the
employee
or
a
portion
of
the
award
goes
to
reimburse
the
workers 
compensation
insurer
for
benefits
already
paid.
Contractors
should
attempt
to
use
these
arguments
to 
negotiate
a
workers
compensation
waiver
of
subrogation
requirement
out
of
the
contract. 
In
recent
years,
insurers
have
been
much
more
aggressive
in
pursuing
subrogation.
NCCI’s
standard 
“Waiver
of
Our
Right
To
Recover
from
Others
Endorsement”
(WC
00
03
13),
reproduced
in
Exhibit
3.5, 
can
be
used
to
waive
subrogation
with
respect
to
scheduled
parties.
Unlike
the
CGL
policy,
the 
contractor’s
waiver
must
be
part
of
a
written
contract
for
the
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
to
be 
triggered.
A
blanket
waiver
of
subrogation
provision
would
remove
the
need
to
notify
the
insurer
every 
time
the
contractor
signs
a
contract
that
includes
a
waiver
of
subrogation
requirement.
(There
is
no 
standard
blanket
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
for
workers
compensation
insurance.)
Further 
demonstrating
insurers’
position
that
a
waiver
of
subrogation
changes
their
rights
under
the
policy,
most 
insurers
charge
a
premium
for
this
endorsement,
in
some
cases
as
high
as
2
percent
of
the
policy 
premium.
Several
states
explicitly
disallow
workers
compensation
waivers
of
subrogation
in
contracts, 
even
if
a
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
is
attached
to
the
policy.
Companies
operating
in
these
states 
should
be
careful
not
to
agree
to
provide
a
workers
compensation
waiver
of
subrogation.

Contractors
Equipment
Waivers
of
subrogation
can
eliminate
the
likelihood
of
needless
litigation
when
contractors
lend
and 
borrow
equipment
to
or
from
other
contractors.
Each
contractor
should
carry
insurance
on
its
own 
property
and
not
rely
on
another
contractor’s
coverage
for
any
damage
sustained.
However,
large 
contractors
may
self-insure
this
exposure.
Usually,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
does
not
prevent
self-insured 
contractors
from
making
a
claim
against
a
negligent
contractor
that
damages
their
equipment. 
Contractors
equipment
forms
are
not
standard,
and
forms
vary
with
regard
to
how
they
address
the
issue 
of
subrogation.
Many
equipment
forms
do
allow
contractors
to
waive
their
rights
of
recovery
prior
to
a 
loss,
but
this
should
never
be
assumed
to
be
the
case. 
Owner’s
Other
Property
Being
held
liable
for
potential
damage
to
existing
property
can
be
a
substantial
loss
exposure
for 
contractors.
For
example,
consider
the
property
damage
liability
exposure
of
a
well
service
contractor 
doing
repair
work
to
an
existing
drilling
rig.
While
the
contractor
may
have
$5
million
or
more
in
liability 
insurance,
the
liability
exposure
is
much
higher.
In
essence,
the
contractor
is
betting
its
business
that
no 
loss
will
occur,
and
this
huge
risk
dwarfs
the
potential
profit
for
the
job.
Similar
imbalances
between
the 
risk
and
potential
reward
often
occur
with
respect
to
renovation,
repair,
and
remodeling
work. 
The
most
efficient
solution
to
this
problem
is
to
use
property
insurance
to
cover
the
direct
and
indirect 
(i.e.,
business
interruption)
exposure
for
damage
to
existing
structures.
Since
property
owners
already 
purchase
permanent
insurance
for
their
property,
it
would
be
redundant
for
a
contractor
working
on
the 
property
to
also
insure
it.
Instead,
any
losses
can
simply
be
confined
to
the
owner’s
property
insurance 
through
a
waiver
of
subrogation
in
the
property
owner’s
policy.
The
waiver
of
rights
of
recovery 
generally
is
structured
to
apply
only
to
insured
losses
and
may
apply
outright
or
above
some
mutually 
agreed
on
threshold.
This
approach
leaves
the
property
owner
with
the
right
to
seek
recovery
against
the 
contractor
for
damage
not
covered
under
its
property
insurance.
If
the
waiver
applies
above
a
stipulated 
dollar
threshold,
the
owner
and
its
insurer
would
be
in
a
position
to
recover
the
applicable
deductible
and 
insured
amounts
up
to
the
agreed
threshold. 
Policies
covering
permanent
property
typically
allow
insureds
to
waive
the
insurer’s
subrogation
rights 
prior
to
a
loss,
using
the
“shall
do
nothing
after
a
loss”
language
found
in
the
CGL
policy
and
business 
auto
policy
(BAP).
Some
policies,
including
the
standard
ISO
commercial
property
policy,
go
a
step 
further
by
affirmatively
stating
that,
to
the
extent
the
insured
waives
its
right
of
recovery
in
a
written 
contract
prior
to
a
loss,
the
insurer’s
subrogation
rights
are
also
waived.

Joint
Operating
Agreements
Because
petroleum
exploration
and
production
(E&P)
operations
involve
substantial
risk
and
expense, 
these
operations
are
rarely
conducted
by
a
single
party.
Rather,
companies
typically
explore
and
produce 
hydrocarbons
as
participants
in
a
joint
venture
together
with
other
joint
interest
owners
under
a
contract 
known
as
a
joint
operating
agreement
(JOA). 
Joint
operations
enable
energy
companies
to
take
on
larger,
more
complex,
and
riskier
projects
than
they 
would
be
willing
or
able
to
handle
on
their
own.
However,
the
associated
liability
exposures
create
risk 
management
and
insurance
challenges.
Successfully
addressing
these
challenges
begins
at
the
very 
inception
of
the
joint
venture,
with
the
drafting
of
the
JOA. 
A
JOA
creates
a
framework
for
a
joint
venture
under
which
the
parties
with
an
interest
in
the
project
will 
conduct
petroleum
operations.
The
JOA
sets
out
the
structure
of
the
venture,
the
allocation
of
risks
and 
costs,
and
the
method
for
sharing
production
and
profit. 
Allocation
of
liability
among
co-owners
should
be
clearly
laid
out
in
the
JOA.
Various
standard
forms 
provide
a
foundation
on
which
to
build
a
joint
operation’s
risk
and
insurance
schemes,
but
they
require 
additional
considerations.
This
chapter
provides
a
general
understanding
of
the
risks
and
liabilities
to
be 
recognized
and
addressed
through
the
JOA. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
identify
the
purpose
and
benefits
of
a
JOA,
2.
recognize
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
various
parties
that
participate
in
joint
operations
under
a 
JOA,
3.
recognize
the
deficiencies
of
form
contracts
and
identify
changes
that
improve
their
clarity
and 
avoid
disputes,
4.
recognize
contractual
methods
of
risk
allocation
that
meet
the
contracting
parties’
expectations,
5.
identify
effective
claims
management
strategies
under
a
JOA,
and
6.
recognize
the
effect
of
various
insurance
requirements
under
a
JOA
and
identify
appropriate 
methods
of
addressing
them.
Purpose
of
a
JOA
The
JOA
performs
the
same
role
among
its
parties
as
another
venture’s
partnership
agreement
performs 
between
its
partners.
However,
joint
interest
owners
are
not
partners
in
the
legal
sense. 
The
JOA’s
two
major
functions
are
as
follows. 
•
Providing
a
basis
for
the
sharing
of
rights
and
liabilities.
Rights
and
liabilities
are
shared
in 
proportion
to
each
party’s
percentage
interest.
•
Providing
rules
for
the
conduct
of
operations.
The
JOA
also
clarifies
other
important
matters. 
33Benefits
of
a
JOA
Entering
into
a
JOA
provides
numerous
benefits,
including
the
following. 
•
A
party
that
undertakes
only
a
portion
of
a
project
can
simultaneously
invest
in
several
other 
projects
thereby
achieving
a
spread
of
risks.
•
Because
a
JOA
also
allows
sharing
of
risk
associated
with
hydrocarbon
exploration,
no
single
party 
bears
all
the
risk
of
the
operation.
•
The
claims
management
and
risk
allocation
scheme
of
JOAs
enables
participants
to
team
up
with 
one
another
to
share
the
expenses,
minimize
the
costs,
and
manage
the
perils
associated
with 
exploration
and
production
work.
•
Participation
in
a
joint
venture
allows
the
venturers
access
to
each
other’s
skills,
which
might
be
in 
the
areas
of
management,
geology,
operations,
or
litigation.
The
Players
and
Their
Roles
Various
entities
play
key
roles
in
the
exploration
and
production
business,
especially
with
respect
to
joint 
operations
and
the
JOA.
This
section
of
the
chapter
discusses
the
roles
of 
•
professional
organizations,
•
the
operator,
•
nonoperators,
and
•
government
agencies.
Professional
Organizations
Two
professional
organizations—the
American
Association
of
Professional
Landmen
(AAPL)
and
the 
Council
of
Petroleum
Accountants
Societies
(COPAS)—play
important
roles
in
exploration
and 
production
business,
particularly
in
the
method
of
contracting
for
and
administering
joint
operations. 
The
American
Association
of
Professional
Landmen
(AAPL)
The
most
important
player
in
the
onshore
E&P
business
is
probably
the
AAPL.
The
AAPL
counts
among 
its
members
thousands
of
oil
and
gas
professionals.
One
of
its
significant
functions
is
to
draft
and
publish 
“model”
JOA
forms
for
use
by
its
members.
The
AAPL
was
established
in
1956,
and
it
released
its
first 
form,
JOA
for
onshore
operations,
that
same
year.
The
organization
subsequently
released
revised 
versions
of
the
form
in
1977,
1982,
and
1989. 
The
Council
of
Petroleum
Accountants
Societies
(COPAS)
COPAS
is
a
professional
organization
that
provides
accounting
expertise
specifically
for
the
oil
and
gas 
industry.
Just
as
the
AAPL
publishes
the
benchmark
form
that
has
become
the
main
JOA
document, 
COPAS
publishes
a
set
of
accounting
procedures
that
are
essentially
industry
standards
and
are
typically 
attached
to
each
JOA
as
an
exhibit.
The
intricacies
of
those
accounting
procedures
are
beyond
the
scope 
of
this
course,
but
their
importance
cannot
be
overstated.
They
are
the
basic
tools
for
determining
which 
costs
are
chargeable
to
the
joint
account
and
the
manner
in
which
those
costs
can
be
charged
in 
connection
with
joint
operations
under
the
JOA. 
The
Operator
The
JOA
designates
one
of
the
co-owners
in
the
mineral
lease
as
the
“operator.”
Other
parties
to
the
JOA 
are
known
as
“nonoperators.” 
Within
certain
confines,
the
operator
is
empowered
to
run
the
joint
operations
on
the
co-owned
property. 
The
designation
carries
significant
power
and
responsibility.
Under
the
AAPL
form,
the
operator
“shall 
conduct
and
direct
and
have
full
control
of
all
operations
on
the
Contract
Area
as
permitted
and
required
34by,
and
within
the
limits
of
this
agreement.” 
The
operator
has
the
roles
and
responsibilities
listed
below. 
•
Coordinator:
The
operator’s
most
important
role
is
that
of
facilitator
and
coordinator,
controlling 
the
action
of
multiple
parties
and
entities—some
with
the
joint
venture
and
some
without,
such
as 
identifying
and
contracting
with
land
owners,
drillers,
service
contractors,
and
regulatory
agencies.
•
Banker:
In
some
ways,
the
operator
acts
as
a
bank,
fronting
expenses
for
the
nonoperators. 
However,
many
oil
and
gas
companies
that
act
as
an
operator
would
bristle
at
the
suggestion
that
it 
is
their
role
to
carry
any
costs
incurred
on
behalf
of
a
nonoperator
beyond
the
period
allowed
for
in 
the
JOA
or
in
COPAS
procedures.
•
Accountant:
An
operator
also
acts
as
an
accountant,
tracking
expenditures
and
billing
the
correct 
portion
of
expenditures
back
to
the
nonoperators
through
a
joint
interest
bill
(JIB).
•
Contracts
manager:
The
operator
serves
an
extremely
important
role
as
contracts
manager,
which 
includes
acting
as
the
limited
agent
of
the
joint
account
when
hiring
and
dealing
with
suppliers, 
drillers,
service
contractors,
property
owners,
etc.
•
Reporter/Compliance
officer:
The
operator
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
reporting
to
regulators, 
nonoperators,
or
the
operator’s
own
shareholders
or
owners
and
complying
with
regulations 
promulgated
by
those
agencies.
•
Claims
handler/Litigator:
An
operator
must
be
ready
to
handle
claims,
including
analyzing
and 
paying
land
owners’
claims,
retaining
attorneys,
monitoring
litigation,
and
keeping
the
balance
of 
the
interest
owners
informed.
In
many
ways,
the
operator’s
role
resembles
that
of
a
general
contractor
on
a
construction
project.
The 
operator
hires
the
drilling
and
service
contractors,
and
it
sometimes
obtains
insurance
for
the
entire 
project.
More
important,
however,
the
operator
is
responsible
for
equipment
purchases,
hiring
of 
accountants,
and
filing
the
appropriate
and
necessary
permits.
The
operator
role
also
includes 
administrative
tasks
such
as
entering
into
contracts
for
joint
operations,
hiring
geologists,
obtaining 
seismic
data,
procuring
licenses,
and
paying
taxes
applicable
to
joint
operations,
along
with
all
of
the 
operational
components.
(For
example,
the
operator
is
responsible
for
getting
wells
drilled,
sidetracked, 
producing,
worked
over,
plugged,
and
abandoned.) 
Most
operators
own
a
relatively
large
percentage
of
the
property
subject
to
the
JOA.
They
accept
the
role 
of
operator
for
various
reasons,
including
the
following. 
•
Control:
The
interest
owner
that
accepts
the
role
of
operator
is
in
charge
of
the
day-to-day 
operation
of
the
property,
decides
in
the
first
instance
how
to
confront
the
daily
challenges 
involved
in
the
operation,
usually
decides
with
whom
to
contract
and
on
what
basis
(including
the 
specific
content
of
written
contracts),
and
typically
has
the
discretion
to
retain
consultants, 
including
so-called
company
men,
engineers,
landmen,
and
consulting
engineers.

Expertise/Reputation:
Some
operators
accept
the
job
because
they
are
good
at
it;
they
are
skillful 
managers
and
money
handlers
and/or
they
have
particular
expertise
in
the
contract
area
and
the 
type
of
operations
to
be
performed.
Serving
as
an
operator
for
a
successful
project
also
enhances 
the
operator’s
reputation
as
an
expert
in
the
field.
•
Economic
incentives:
Within
COPAS
rules,
some
operators
seek
to
lay
off
some
wider 
administrative
costs
among
the
joint
account.
Some
operators
even
receive
an
administrative
fee 
from
the
balance
of
interest
owners
as
an
incentive
to
take
on
a
leadership
role.
The
operator
assumes
much
of
the
responsibility
of
the
joint
operation.
However,
most
JOAs
protect
the 
operator
from
the
risks
associated
with
this
elevated
level
of
responsibility.
Under
most
JOAs,
the 
operator
is
exculpated
from
all
liability,
except
to
the
extent
caused
by
its
own
gross
negligence
or
willful 
misconduct. 
35Outsider
as
Operator
Sometimes
the
co-owners
will
hire
an
outsider
(i.e.,
a
non-interest
owner)
to
perform
the
operator
role. 
For
practical
purposes,
the
parties
can
accomplish
that
arrangement
at
least
three
different
ways. 
Non-Interest-Owning
Operator
Enters
the
JOA
One
approach
is
to
have
the
non-interest-owning
operator
enter
into
the
JOA.
The
AAPL
form
generally 
does
not
provide
for
that
arrangement.
Under
the
AAPL
form,
even
when
the
operator
resigns
or
is 
removed,
the
form
provides
that
“the
successor
operator
shall
be
selected
from
the
parties
owning
an 
interest
in
the
Contract
Area
at
the
time
such
successor
Operator
is
selected.”
If
the
operator
subsequently 
“no
longer
owns
an
interest
[under
the
JOA]
in
the
Contract
Area
...
Operator
shall
be
deemed
to
have 
resigned.”
The
primary
reason
for
this
peculiarity
is
to
ensure
that
the
party
responsible
for
conducting
the 
joint
operations
has
some
skin
in
the
game.
Parties
rest
easier
when
the
operator
shares
their
interest
in 
conducting
a
safe,
efficient,
cost-effective
operation. 
Nevertheless,
under
certain
circumstances,
a
non-interest
owner
may
be
tapped
to
assume
the
operator 
role.
Perhaps
the
original
operator
resigns
or
sells
its
interest
and
no
other
interest
owner
has
the
capacity 
or
willingness
to
perform
the
tasks.
Alternatively,
the
operator
may
have
undergone
a
shift
in
corporate 
structure
and
one
of
its
affiliates
now
owns
its
interest
in
the
contract
area.
The
AAPL
form
does 
recognize
and
allows
the
latter
scenario.
Section
V(B)(1)
provides
that
“[a]
change
of
a
corporate
name
or 
structure
of
Operator
or
transfer
of
Operator’s
interests
to
any
single
subsidiary,
parent
or
successor 
corporation
shall
not
be
the
basis
for
removal
of
Operator.”
And
for
some
larger
E&P
companies,
this 
approach—one
affiliate
owns
the
interest
and
another
is
to
perform
the
operator
function—is
a
standard 
feature
in
their
custom
forms. 
Operator
Hires
a
Contract
Operator
Another
approach
is
for
the
operator
to
hire
a
“contract
operator”
pursuant
to
a
separate
agreement,
under 
which
the
operator
essentially
subcontracts
all
or
a
significant
portion
of
its
operator
duties.
Under
this 
approach,
however,
the
operator
will
remain
bound
to
the
nonoperators
for
performance
under
the
JOA. 
Split
Responsibilities
In
some
rare
instances,
parties
to
the
JOA
will
split
the
operator
responsibilities,
either
under
the
JOA 
itself
or
through
a
side
agreement
that
allocates
certain
operator
responsibilities
to
be
performed
by 
another
interest
owner.
Nontraditional
arrangements
of
this
type
create
risk
allocation
concerns.
No 
matter
who
assumes
the
roles
of
the
operator,
the
parties
must
be
careful
to
ensure
that
the
risks
of
the 
operations
are
allocated
to
the
appropriate
persons,
unique
risk
allocation
concerns
are
not
overlooked, 
and
proper
insurance
is
in
place
to
protect
the
joint
interests. 
Nonoperators
Nonoperators
are
investors
whose
role
is
generally
passive
and
limited.
If
the
operations
run
smoothly, 
nonoperators
pay
their
participating
interest
shares
of
joint
operations,
vote
on
some
major
issues,
and 
(with
any
luck)
collect
revenue.
Otherwise,
the
operator
runs
the
show.
But
if
the
operations
encounter 
problems,
if
large
casualties
occur,
or
if
the
operator’s
management
decisions
become
contentious, 
nonoperators
may
need
to
become
more
involved.
A
well-drafted
JOA
will
dictate
how
the
operator
and 
nonoperator
relationship
works
and
what
role
the
nonoperator
plays
if
problems
arise. 
The
AAPL
form
contains
several
instances
that
require
a
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
interest
owners.
For 
example,
Section
V(B)(1)
of
the
AAPL
form
provides
as
follows. 
 
Operator
may
be
removed
only
for
good
cause
by
the
affirmative
vote
of
Non-Operators
owning 
a
majority
interest
based
on
ownership
as
shown
on
Exhibit
“A”
remaining
after
excluding
the 
voting
interest
of
Operator.... 
Owners
with
the
largest
interests
in
the
project
often
carry
more
influence
than
smaller
interest
owners
do. 
Of
course,
the
larger
interest
owners
also
bear
more
risk,
particularly
if
large
liabilities
arise
out
of
the 
operations.
Conversely,
unless
they
are
also
the
operator,
parties
with
small
ownership
interests
in
the
36joint
drilling
operations
typically
have
relatively
little
power
over
the
operations
themselves. 
With
regard
to
certain
types
of
activities,
all
interested
parties
must
agree
to
participate,
so
even
small 
interest
owners
can
play
an
important
role
in
the
overall
operations.
Conversely,
some
activities
may 
require
only
an
“informational
authority
for
expenditure
(AFE),”
which
merely
lets
the
interest
owners 
know
that
certain
legal
or
contractually
required
operations
will
be
conducted
and
the
interest
owners 
have
no
discretion
in
paying
their
proportionate
share
of
the
costs
from
that
activity. 
Government
Agencies
The
other
major
players
in
the
context
of
joint
operations
are
state
agencies,
such
as
the
Texas
Railroad 
Commission,
the
Louisiana
Department
of
Natural
Resources,
tribal
governments,
and
federal
agencies 
(including
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
the
Occupational
Safety
and
Health 
Administration)
and
their
state
counterparts.
These
agencies
promulgate
and
enforce
rules,
conduct 
inspections,
impose
reporting
requirements,
and
penalize
interest
owners
for
noncompliance. 
Modification
of
Contract
Forms
Given
the
high
stakes
involved
and
the
sizable
risks
they
face,
energy
companies
usually
opt
for 
tried-and-true
methods
of
business.
This
tradition-bound
attitude
extends
to
the
contractual
relationships 
that
joint
interest
owners
form. 
Some
operators
(particularly
large
ones)
use
their
own
JOA
forms.
However,
the
predominant
practice 
throughout
the
onshore
industry
is
to
use
either
an
AAPL
form
or
a
slightly
modified
version
of
it. 
Therefore,
the
provisions
set
forth
in
the
AAPL
form
have
largely
become
the
benchmark
for
the
entire 
industry.
Unless
otherwise
indicated,
our
references
in
this
course
to
the
AAPL
form
refer
specifically
to 
AAPL
Form
610–1989:
Model
Form
Operating
Agreement. 
AAPL
forms
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
industry
as
a
whole,
including
those
entities
that
do
not
use 
the
AAPL
forms.
But
it
does
not
follow
that
operators
should
delegate
all
contract
drafting 
responsibilities
to
the
AAPL.
Not
all
joint
operations
are
the
same.
Each
operation
faces
its
own
set
of 
risks
and
challenges. 
•
Some
operations
take
place
in
a
permissive
regulatory
environment;
some
do
not.
•
Some
drilling
or
production
work
is
technically
difficult;
some
is
easier.
•
Some
operations
are
undertaken
with
cooperative
and
well-known
interest
owners;
sometimes
new 
or
inexperienced
interest
owners
join
the
group.
Due
to
tradition,
a
conservative
attitude,
or
perhaps
just
inertia—joint
interest
owners
can
be
reluctant
to 
modify
the
standard
AAPL
form.
But
the
form
should
be
modified,
both
to
account
for
industry
changes 
and
to
account
for
the
parties’
management
styles,
risk
tolerance,
and
attitudes.
And
to
best
modify
the 
form,
the
parties
must
first
negotiate
with
one
another. 
The
best
approach
for
a
mutually
satisfactory
contract
negotiation
is
to
first
understand
how
the
contract 
is
designed
to
work.
Armed
with
that
knowledge,
one
can
understand
why
certain
changes
are
being 
requested.
For
example,
AAPL
forms
must
be
modified
to
fit
the
parties’
particular
situation
and 
jurisdictional
requirements.
Accordingly,
parties
should
avoid
signing
an
unmodified
AAPL
form
without 
considering
the
particularities
of
their
operations. 
Once
the
JOA
is
in
place,
the
operator
may
enter
into
other
contracts
to
perform
the
operations,
such
as 
drilling
contracts
and
service
contracts
discussed
in
Chapters
5
and
6.
The
various
contracts
must
work 
together,
because
the
structure
of
contracts
in
the
E&P
business
creates
a
situation
in
which
a
promise 
made
in
one
contract
must
often
be
kept
through
another
contract. 
Operators
should
be
careful
not
to
make
promises
in
their
other
contracts
that
conflict
with
the
JOA.
For 
example,
a
standard
feature
of
drilling
contracts
and
service
contracts
is
for
the
operator
to
indemnify
the 
other
party
from
claims
by
the
operator’s
broadly
defined
economic
“group.”
The
operator’s
“group” 
often
includes
its
nonoperating
interest
owners.
As
such,
in
those
service
contracts,
the
operator
is
being
37asked
to
indemnify
its
contractors
from
claims
by
the
nonoperators.
The
operator
should
obtain
specific 
and
sufficient
authority
within
the
JOA
to
bind
the
nonoperators
to
traditional
provisions
in
today’s 
drilling
and
service
contracts;
these
provisions,
which
are
now
traditional,
include
consequential
damages 
waivers,
indemnity/hold
harmless
provisions,
confidentiality,
etc.
The
nonoperators
should,
as
discussed 
later,
waive
claims
against
the
service
contractor
to
the
same
extent
as
the
operator. 
While
language
in
most
JOAs
is
sufficient
to
grant
the
operator
authority
to
bind
the
nonoperators
to
such 
provisions,
it
is
prudent
for
the
operator
to
specifically
confirm
and/or
verify
that
it
has
the
nonoperators’ 
permission
to
make
these
promises.
One
way
to
confirm
that
the
operator
has
sufficient
authority
to
make 
these
promises
on
behalf
of
the
joint
account
is
to
specifically
say
so
in
the
JOA
as
follows. 
 
The
Operator’s
right
and
responsibility
to
conduct
operations
and
activities
in
the
Contract
Area 
includes
contracting
with
service
providers
and
suppliers
on
reasonable
commercial
terms.
Such 
terms
may
include
releases
and
hold
harmless
obligations,
to
which
the
parties
hereby
consent. 
Nonoperators
should
be
more
involved
than
they
usually
are
in
modifying
the
JOA
form.
Nonoperators 
that
sign
the
JOA
exactly
as
offered
by
the
operator
are
often
surprised
by
results
or
by
what
is
simply
not 
addressed
in
the
form.
For
example,
the
JOA
might
fail
to
address
the
following
questions. 
•
On
what
basis
do
the
parties
decide
whether
to
settle
litigation
affecting
the
joint
account?
•
May
a
nonoperator
withhold
payment
of
a
joint
interest
billing
(JIB)
2
when
it
has
a
dispute
with
the 
operator?
•
To
what
extent
may
the
operator
bind
the
nonoperator
to
contractual
limitations
with
suppliers
and 
contractors?
These
questions
should
(and
can)
be
addressed
head-on
in
an
addendum
to
the
JOA
form
and
with
the 
input
of
nonoperators.
Even
if
the
result
of
these
modifications
is
disadvantageous
to
one
party
in
relation 
to
the
others,
the
modification
creates
some
certainty
that
reduces
the
potential
for
internal
disputes, 
increased
third-party
exposure,
wasted
money,
and
broken
relationships. 
Role
of
Insurance
Insurance
plays
a
key
role
in
connection
with
joint
operations
and
the
JOA. 
The
Importance
of
Insurance
Both
operators
and
nonoperators
want
their
liability
exposures
to
be
covered
by
insurance.
Many 
important
issues—such
as
who
is
responsible
for
obtaining
the
insurance,
how
much
insurance
to 
purchase,
who
is
responsible
for
ensuring
that
each
interest
owner
has
enough
insurance,
and
who
is 
responsible
for
ensuring
that
no
one
is
paying
for
duplicative
or
illusory
coverage—should
be
allocated
in 
the
JOA.
It
is
essential
to
coordinate
insurance
programs
among
interest
owners
and
to
record
these 
decisions
in
the
JOA.
However,
the
standard
forms
do
not
adequately
cover
these
details. 
Operator’s
Insurance
Coverage
Standard
JOA
forms,
for
the
most
part,
omit
the
details
concerning
insurance
the
operator
must
maintain 
for
the
benefit
of
the
joint
account.
They
fail
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
insurance
should
be 
procured
jointly
by
the
co-owners
or
carried
severally
by
each
owner
to
cover
its
respective
participating 
interest
shares. 
Sometimes,
all
parties
carry
their
own
insurance.
Often,
however,
nonoperators
rely
primarily
on
the 
operator’s
insurance
program.
JOA
forms
typically
require
the
operator
to
maintain
workers 
compensation
insurance
and
auto
insurance
(if
necessary),
and
often
general
liability
coverages,
but
the 
other
insurance
details
are
left
to
the
parties.
In
some
situations,
general
liability
coverage
is
not
part
of 
the
insurance
program
for
the
joint
account.
Rather,
each
interest
owner
may
be
responsible
for
obtaining 
liability
coverage
for
itself.
Consequently,
the
parties
must
carefully
and
deliberately
analyze
their 
insurance
needs
and
determine
what
coverages
the
operator
is
carrying
and
at
what
limits. 
Unless
they
also
act
as
operators
on
other
wells,
nonoperators
rarely
carry
operators
extra
expense/control
38of
well
(OEE/COW)
coverage.
3
Designed
to
provide
coverage
for
well
control,
redrill,
and
restoration 
expenses
incurred
in
respect
of
drilling
or
nondrilling
wells
(wells
that
are
producing,
suspended,
or 
abandoned),
OEE/COW
coverage
is
critical
to
any
operation,
so
it
is
important
to
spell
out
the
type
and 
amount
of
OEE/COW
insurance
the
operator
must
obtain
for
the
joint
account. 
The
parties
might
also
want
the
operator
to
carry
a
large
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy,
along 
with
umbrella
coverage,
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
any
potential
liability.
Additionally,
if
the 
operations
involve
maritime
exposures,
the
JOA
may
require
maritime
coverages. 
Opt-Ins,
Opt-Outs,
and
Duplicate
Coverage
Some
JOAs
allow
nonoperators
to
opt
into
or
opt
out
of
the
suite
of
coverages
that
the
operator
maintains. 
These
arrangements
are
preferred
when
some
nonoperators
maintain
their
own
extensive
insurance 
programs
and
others
do
not.
However,
nonoperators
should
pay
close
attention
to
whether
the 
arrangement
is
“opt-in”
or
“opt-out.”
If
it
is
an
“opt-in”
arrangement,
those
parties
could
have
no 
protection
against
casualties
for
which
the
other
interest
owners
are
covered. 
Similarly,
if
a
party
maintains
its
own
insurance
coverages
and
the
JOA
contains
an
“opt-out” 
mechanism,
that
party
must
make
sure
that
it
follows
the
opt-out
procedure.
Otherwise,
it
may
have 
duplicate
coverage,
which
not
only
means
the
interest
owner
is
paying
for
double
coverage
but
also 
creates
its
own
set
of
problems.
An
interest
owner
that
maintains
its
own
insurance
coverage
should
be 
careful
to
ensure
that
coverage
maintained
for
the
joint
account
is
primary
to
the
interest
owner’s
own 
coverage
to
the
extent
the
policies
could
cover
the
same
risks.
Otherwise,
two
insurance
companies
and 
two
sets
of
attorneys
may
be
representing
that
interest
owner
in
the
event
of
a
casualty.
This
arrangement 
is
inefficient,
and
it
can
create
conflicts
if
the
two
sets
of
lawyers
have
different
strategies. 
General
Insurance
Concepts
in
the
Context
of
the
JOA
Insurance
should
be
in
place
to
protect
all
the
interest
owners
from
potential
casualties
that
arise
during 
the
operations.
Most
risks
will
be
shared
by
the
interest
owners
in
proportion
to
their
interest
in
the 
applicable
operation,
and
the
parties
should
ensure
that
their
insurance
protections
dovetail
with
that 
arrangement. 
The
“Big
Three”
Protections
for
Joint
Account
Policies
To
adequately
protect
the
joint
account,
all
JOAs
should
include
the
three
critical
insurance
protections 
(the
“big
three”)
discussed
in
this
section. 
•
Insured
status
•
Waiver
of
subrogation
•
Primary
and
noncontributory
coverage
Insured
Status
Nonoperating
interest
owners
should
either
be
named
insureds
on
the
joint
account
policies
or,
at
a 
minimum,
be
named
as
additional
insureds
on
the
joint
account
policies. 
Each
interest
owner
(if
not
a
named
insured)
should
be
named
as
additional
insured
on
any
liability 
coverages
maintained
for
the
joint
account
(other
than
workers
compensation
insurance).
In
the
event
of
a 
casualty,
and
if
there
were
any
allegations
that
the
nonoperators
were
somehow
negligent
in
causing
that 
casualty,
additional
insured
status
(or
actually
having
them
named
as
insureds
on
the
policy)
will
allow 
for
the
protection
of
the
nonoperators
under
the
insurance
procured
for
the
joint
account. 
Additional
insured
protection,
however,
may
not
be
available
for
certain
insurance
coverages,
notably 
workers
compensation
coverage,
operators
extra
expense/control
of
well
(OEE/COW)
coverage, 
first-party
property
policies,
and
professional
liability
policies.
Nevertheless,
additional
insured
status 
should
still
be
obtained
on
any
insurance
coverage
related
to
the
work. 
Parties
should
also
be
careful
to
ensure
that
the
additional
insured
protection
is
not
limited
39inappropriately.
For
example,
some
additional
insured
endorsements
are
narrow
and
only
apply
in
certain 
circumstances. 
Waiver
of
Subrogation
The
second
“big
three”
protection
is
a
waiver
of
subrogation.
This
protection
prevents
the
insurer
of
the 
joint
account
insurance
from
asserting
claims
against
the
parties’
other
insurers.
Although
it
can 
effectively
produce
some
of
the
same
benefits
as
additional
insured
status,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
can 
apply
to
policies
for
which
additional
insured
status
is
unavailable. 
Primary
and
Noncontributory
Coverage
The
final
“big
three”
protection
is
for
the
joint
account
coverage
to
be
“primary
and
noncontributory”
to 
the
parties’
other
insurance
policies.
Most
policies
contain
“other
insurance”
clauses
that
aim
to
share
the 
risk
of
exposure
with
(or
shift
the
entire
risk
to)
other
policies
of
any
party
that
may
cover
the
same
loss. 
Without
a
statement
of
primacy,
the
“other
insurance”
clause
could
frustrate
the
parties’
intent
to
have
the 
joint
account
coverage
respond
to
the
losses
arising
out
of
the
joint
operations. 
Insuring
Contractual
Liability
Nonoperators
generally
have
no
duty
to
third
parties
and,
hence,
cannot
be
sued
in
tort
for
bodily
injury
or 
property
damage
that
results
within
a
contract
area.
But
sometimes
plaintiffs
are
stubborn
or
are
hoping 
for
an
anomaly,
and
they
file
suit
against
the
nonoperators
anyway. 
Under
JOAs,
the
nonoperating
interest
owners
assume
indirect
responsibility
for
losses
by
contractually 
assuming
risk
for
which
they
would
otherwise
not
be
responsible
without
the
contract.
Contractual 
liability
may
be
(and
often
is)
excluded
from
a
general
liability
form.
When
it
is
covered,
contractual 
liability
is
often
covered
only
through
an
exception
to
the
contractual
liability
exclusion.
The
parties 
should
seek
clarity
as
to
the
scope
of
the
contractual
liability
exclusion
for
claims,
expenses,
and
defense 
costs
that
flow
through
the
JOA.
Contractual
liability
coverage
is
typically
provided
through
the
CGL 
policy’s
definition
of
an
“insured
contract,”
which
provides
coverage
for
an
insured’s
obligation
under
a 
contract
or
agreement
to
indemnify
another
for
the
assumption
of
tort
liability.
There
is
a
potential 
problem
with
a
nonoperator’s
insurance
when
the
nonoperator
is
sued
directly,
because
the
insurance
may 
not
provide
coverage
for
the
contractual
indemnity
the
nonoperator
assumed
under
the
JOA. 
When
only
the
operator
is
sued,
the
source
of
the
nonoperator’s
exposure
is
its
contractually
assumed 
obligation
in
the
JOA
to
reimburse
the
operator
for
its
share
of
expenses
(provided
litigation
costs
are 
included
as
“costs”
in
the
JOA).
Because
the
JOA
obligates
the
nonoperator
to
indemnify
the
operator
for 
the
operator’s
negligence,
this
should
be
a
classical
example
of
insured
contractual
indemnity.
This 
coverage
scheme
is
less
than
ideal
and
may
create
more
anxiety
rather
than
comfort.
In
fact,
many
policy 
forms
expose
the
policyholder
to
potentially
catastrophic
uninsured
losses. 
For
example,
some
policy
forms
provide
coverage
only
if
the
named
policyholder
is
partially
at
fault.
This 
proposition
can
be
devastating
for
a
nonoperating
interest
owner
with
a
large
interest
in
the
joint 
operations,
because
the
nonoperating
interest
owner
will
rarely
have
any
fault
but
could
still
have 
significant
exposure.
Interest
owners
should
therefore
be
cautious
about
the
narrow
policy
forms
used
in 
the
insurance
market
and
take
steps
to
avoid
ill
effects.
One
step
is
to
negotiate
specially
tailored 
(manuscript)
contractual
liability
coverage
to
make
it
clear
that
the
liabilities
that
flow
through
the
JOA 
are
covered
under
the
nonoperator’s
CGL
policy. 
Some
insurers
have
tried
to
argue
that
this
obligation
is
simply
a
partnership
arrangement,
not
an 
indemnity
obligation,
and
that
the
losses
are
business
expenses
rather
than
insured
casualty
losses.
At 
least
one
federal
district
court
has
rejected
this
position.
In
Burlington
Res.,
Inc.
v.
United
Nat’l
Ins.
Co., 
481
F.
Supp.
2d
567
(E.D.
La.
2007),
the
federal
Eastern
District
Court
of
Louisiana
held
that
a 
nonoperator
was
covered
under
its
liability
policy
because
its
exposure
for
its
percentage
of
a
casualty 
that
resulted
from
a
well
blowout
arose
out
of
its
contractually
assumed
liability
for
its
proportionate 
interest
under
the
JOA. 
The
Burlington
decision
represents
a
significant
victory
for
nonoperators
seeking
to
protect
themselves
40via
contractual
liability
insurance
coverage.
Nevertheless,
nonoperators
should
still
be
cautious
in
their 
reliance
on
a
decision
by
a
trial
court.
Nonoperators
would
be
wise
to
take
affirmative
steps
to
avoid
the 
risk
that
their
insurer
would
take
a
position
similar
to
that
of
the
insurer
in
the
Burlington
case
by 
obtaining
a
broader
contractual
liability
endorsement. 
Role
of
the
Insurance
Agent
or
Broker
Operators
and
nonoperators
should
involve
their
insurance
agents
or
brokers
to
ensure
that
they
have
the 
proper
protections
in
place.
Agents
and
brokers
can
review
JOAs
(and
other
E&P
contracts)
to
evaluate 
the
types
of
coverage
that
the
participants
need.
An
agent
or
broker
can
also
guide
clients
to
quality 
insurers
that
are
less
likely
to
dishonor
their
coverage
obligations
or
to
press
strained
interpretations
of 
policy
limitations.
Sophisticated
agents
or
brokers
may
even
be
able
to
obtain
manuscript
policy 
endorsements.
For
larger
accounts,
an
agent
or
broker
may
even
have
the
power
to
negotiate
manuscript 
endorsements
that
expressly
cover
some
of
the
risks
for
which
coverage
may
be
questionable
under 
standard
insurance
language.
Taking
this
step
early
can
prevent
or
alleviate
unexpected
exposures
from 
creating
problems
later. 
Analysis
of
Insurance
Limits
and
Insurance
Coverage
The
operator,
with
the
input
of
the
nonoperators,
should
carefully
analyze
the
limits
of
insurance
required. 
The
standard
approach
to
liability
insurance
(perhaps
$1
million
of
general
liability
coverage
or
at
most 
$5
million)
might
not
be
appropriate
in
today’s
litigious
environment.
If
so,
Exhibit
D
(Insurance
and 
Indemnity)
of
the
1989
AAPL
form,
which
describes
the
usual
insurance
limits,
must
be
modified. 
Moreover,
the
parties
should
ascertain
what
the
general
liability
policies
cover
since
not
all
contractually 
assumed
liabilities
are
covered
under
standard
general
liability
policies.
Furthermore,
the
parties
should 
clearly
state
the
scope
and
intent
of
the
insurance
obligations
in
the
JOA
by
addressing
the
following 
questions. 
•
How
much
insurance
is
the
operator
providing?
•
What
coverages
are
the
nonoperators
required
to
provide?
•
What
are
the
applicable
insurance
policies’
limits?
•
Should
any
special
exposures
be
addressed?
•
What
is
the
history
of
well
control
problems
in
the
area,
and
are
the
insurance
limits
sufficient
in 
light
of
those
problems?
The
point
here
is
to
not
rely
on
the
same
old
way
of
doing
business.
The
operator
(with
the
participation 
of
the
nonoperators)
should
consult
an
experienced
insurance
agent
or
broker,
dwell
for
a
while
on
the 
“parade
of
horribles”
(what
bad
things
can
happen,
what
horror
stories
have
been
heard),
and
think
about 
how
to
prevent
them
in
the
future.
In
particular,
the
interest
owners
should
note
the
policy
requirements 
for
the
reporting
of
pollution
events
and,
as
discussed
in
greater
detail
below,
consider
addressing
the 
operator’s
responsibility
for
reporting
these
events
in
the
JOA. 
Pollution
Coverage
A
typical
pollution
buyback
provision
in
a
liability
insurance
policy
starts
with
an
absolute
pollution 
exclusion,
excluding
all
liability
in
any
way
arising
out
of
a
very
broadly
defined
concept
of
pollution. 
Then
the
insurance
company
allows
the
policyholder
to
“buy
back”
limited
pollution
coverage
that
creates 
an
exception
to
the
absolute
pollution
exclusion,
with
the
exception
applying
only
if
strict
discovery
and 
reporting
deadlines
are
met.
The
problem,
of
course,
is
that
sometimes
pollution
events
take
place
without 
the
policyholder’s
knowledge
(either
because
of
internal
communication
challenges
or
because
a 
contractor
or
consultant
fails
to
report
them). 
The
parties
to
a
JOA
should
consider
whether
to
contractually
require
the
operator
to
be
consciously 
aware
of
these
limitations
and
to
specifically
comply
with
the
deadlines
imposed
within
insurance 
policies,
including
notice
of
occurrence,
notice
of
claim,
and
the
reporting
of
pollution. 
41Consideration
should
be
given
regarding
the
type
of
insurance
(OEE/COW,
property
damage,
loss
of 
production
income/business
interruption
coverage).
Obtaining
OEE/COW
insurance
is
usually
required 
and,
frankly,
a
no-brainer.
The
real
issue
is
from
whom
to
buy
the
coverage
and
for
what
limits.
Deciding 
how
much
coverage
to
buy
is
a
function
of
risk,
risk
tolerance,
and
the
ability
to
pay.
But
attempting
to 
save
money
by
reducing
policy
limits
often
turns
out
to
be
a
bad
idea.
A
well
blowout
or
pollution
event 
can
be
extraordinarily
expensive,
easily
surpassing
the
$5
million
liability
of
OEE/COW
many
operators 
normally
carry. 
Risk
Allocation
The
goal
in
the
exploration
and
production
business
is
to
drill
for
and
produce
hydrocarbons
in
paying 
quantities.
For
any
number
of
reasons,
this
goal
is
not
always
accomplished.
Beyond
the
fundamental
risk 
of
drilling
dry
holes,
drilling
and
production
operations
carry
numerous
other
casualty
and
business
risks. 
JOAs
allocate
the
costs,
liabilities,
risks,
and
rewards
of
the
drilling
operations. 
An
overarching
theme
of
the
JOA
is
to
ensure
that
the
amount
of
risk
that
each
party
bears
(financially 
and
legally)
is
commensurate
with
that
party’s
level
of
participation
in
and
contribution
to
the
joint 
operation.
The
default
risk
allocation
provision
of
the
American
Association
of
Professional
Landmen 
(AAPL)
form
states: 
 
Unless
changed
by
other
provisions,
all
costs
and
liabilities
incurred
in
operations
under
this 
agreement
shall
be
borne
and
paid,
and
all
equipment
and
materials
acquired
in
operations
on
the 
Contract
Area
shall
be
owned,
by
the
parties
as
their
interests
are
set
forth
in
Exhibit
“A.”
4 
Although
the
AAPL
form
sets
forth
the
default
rule,
most
costs
and
liabilities
of
the
operations
are
not 
necessarily
borne
by
all
parties
but
rather
only
by
the
parties
participating
in
the
particular
operation
to 
the
extent
of
their
participating
interest
share
of
the
operation
in
question. 
The
parties
should
carefully
consider
what
constitutes
“costs”
under
this
provision.
Certainly,
the
day
rate 
for
the
driller,
the
cost
of
drill
pipe
and
casing,
and
even
attorneys’
fees
are
traditional
“costs”
and
are
not 
subject
to
challenge
if
the
amounts
are
reasonable
for
the
work
performed.
But
what
about
fines, 
penalties,
uninsured
pollution
cleanup
costs,
and
consequential
damages?
While
the
nonoperator’s 
liability
of
its
share
of
such
costs
might
turn
on
the
effect
of
the
exculpatory
clause
(discussed
later), 
based
on
the
parties’
attitudes
and
temperament
or
on
trending
jurisprudence,
the
answer
might
not
be 
clear.
The
better
approach
is
to
specify
in
the
JOA
what
constitutes
“costs.” 
The
operator
will
usually
prefer
a
broader
definition
of
costs
that
allows
it
to
more
effectively
argue
that 
the
nonoperators
are
required
to
pay
their
participating
interest
shares.
Nonoperators
tend
to
prefer
a
more 
limited
definition
of
costs
because
it
may
reduce
their
exposure
to
having
to
pay
for
things
related
to
a 
joint
operation.
Whatever
the
decision,
the
JOA
form
should
be
modified
to
reflect
the
parties’
intent. 
Basic
Commercial
Risks
of
a
JOA:
Consenting
and
Nonparticipating
Parties
When
parties
enter
into
a
typical
JOA,
the
only
drilling
activity
to
which
the
parties
consent
is
drilling
the 
initial
well
(and
subsequently
plugging
and
abandoning
it).
Beyond
that,
additional
activity
in
the
contract 
area
is
largely
elective.
The
costs
and
liabilities
of
these
elective
operations
are
shared
by
the
“consenting 
parties”
(i.e.,
the
parties
that
agreed
to
participate
in
the
particular
operation). 
For
operations
in
which
only
some
of
the
interest
owners
elect
to
participate,
“[t]he
entire
cost
and
risk
of 
conducting
such
operations
shall
be
borne
by
the
Consenting
Parties
in
the
proportions
they
have
elected 
to
bear”
for
that
operation.
5
This
is,
in
theory,
a
simple
approach.
But
sometimes,
responsibility
for
costs 
or
liabilities
can
vary
over
the
course
of
an
operation
(e.g.,
when
a
consenting
party
elects
to 
“nonconsent”
to
a
subsequent
operation
or
a
supplemental
AFE),
creating
complex
liability
and 
accounting
issues
and
certain
disharmony
among
the
interest
owners. 
Although
they
may
avoid
the
costs
and
risks
of
the
drilling
operations
in
which
they
elect
not
to 
participate,
nonconsenting
parties
run
the
risk
that
the
consenting
parties
hit
it
big.
For
example,
when 
coworkers
pool
their
money
together
and
buy
lottery
tickets
for
a
particularly
large
jackpot,
the
prospect 
that
one’s
colleagues
might
win,
thus
leaving
out
any
nonparticipant,
could
influence
one’s
decision
to
42contribute
money
to
purchase
lottery
tickets.
One
might
not
otherwise
be
inclined
to
spend
money
on
the 
lottery.
JOAs
have
similar
pressures
built
into
them.
If
an
operation
produces
in
paying
quantities,
the 
consenting
parties
collect
the
nonconsenting
parties’
share
of
the
proceeds
up
to
a
substantial
amount. 
When
a
party
consents
to
an
operation,
however,
it
is
typically
not
just
consenting
to
a
specified
dollar 
amount.
Rather,
it
is
consenting
to
the
operation
itself,
regardless
of
the
expense.
An
authority
for 
expenditure
(AFE)
6
is
the
mechanism
used
to
request
authority
to
undertake
operations
under
the
JOA. 
The
AFE
is
a
document,
usually
prepared
by
the
operator,
listing
the
estimated
cost
of
drilling
a
well
to
a 
specified
point
and
then
either
completing
or
abandoning
the
well.
AFEs
typically
contain
estimates 
rather
than
firm
bids
or
fully
itemized
costs.
So,
in
some
ways,
the
consenting
parties
may
be
writing 
what
is
essentially
a
blank
check.
One
way
to
protect
against
the
risks
associated
with
this
scheme
is
for 
the
nonoperating
interest
owners
to
insist
on
a
cap
of
the
expenses.
The
standard
form
does
not
provide 
any
type
of
ceiling,
so
this
is
something
that
the
parties
will
have
to
negotiate. 
Nonjoint
Losses,
Costs,
and
Expenses
It
is
important
to
consider
subsequently
created
interests
and
the
cost
of
title
examinations,
defects,
and 
renewals
when
parties
are
negotiating
the
JOA,
including
whether
the
AAPL
form’s
approach
to
these 
issues
should
be
modified. 
Subsequently
Created
Interests
When
a
party
contributes
a
lease
or
other
mineral
interest
to
the
joint
operations,
the
assumption
is
that
it 
will
not
be
later
burdened
by
priority
interests.
If
this
occurs,
the
party
that
contributed
the
interest
that
is 
later
burdened
by
a
subsequently
created
interest
“shall
assume
and
alone
bear,
pay
and
discharge
the 
Subsequently
Created
Interest
and
shall
indemnify,
defend
and
hold
harmless
the
other
parties
from
and 
against
any
liability
therefor.”
7 
Cost
of
Title
Examinations,
Defects,
and
Renewals
Under
the
standard
AAPL
form,
the
consenting
parties
are
responsible
for
the
cost
of
title
examinations 
performed
in
connection
with
each
well.
But
if
title
to
any
interest
is
defective,
the
party
responsible
for 
providing
that
interest
is
responsible
for
all
necessary
curative
work
to
secure
title.
Under
the
AAPL
form, 
the
responsible
party
has
90
days
to
cure
title.
If
no
party
is
responsible
for
the
loss
or
failure
of
title
as 
provided
under
the
JOA,
then
the
loss
or
failure
is
borne
equally
by
all
parties. 
Importance
of
the
Exculpatory
Clause
Under
most
JOAs,
the
operator
is
exculpated
from
all
liability,
except
to
the
extent
caused
by
its
own 
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct.
In
the
same
way,
all
consenting
parties
in
a
joint
operation
will
be 
responsible
for
their
participating
interest
share
of
the
costs
and
liabilities
that
flow
from
that
operation, 
even
if
the
operator
was
negligent
in
conducting
those
operations. 
The
AAPL
form’s
exculpatory
clause
states
as
follows. 
 
Operator
shall
conduct
its
activities
under
this
agreement
as
a
reasonable
prudent
operator,
in
a 
good
and
workmanlike
manner,
with
due
diligence
and
dispatch,
in
accordance
with
good
oilfield 
practice,
and
in
compliance
with
applicable
law
and
regulations,
but
in
no
event
shall
it
have
any 
liability
as
Operator
to
the
other
parties
for
losses
sustained
or
liabilities
incurred
except
such
as 
may
result
from
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct.
8 
The
exculpatory
clause
provides
enormous
protection
for
the
operator
because,
regardless
of
the 
applicable
law,
gross
negligence
is
difficult
to
establish.
The
law
throughout
most
jurisdictions
is
similar: 
Mere
inadvertence
or
an
honest
mistake
does
not
qualify
as
gross
negligence.
Rather,
gross
negligence
is 
willful,
wanton,
and
reckless
conduct
that
falls
between
intent
to
do
wrong
and
ordinary
negligence. 
Both
Texas
and
Louisiana
courts
have
ruled
that
there
is
little
distinction
between
willful
misconduct
and 
gross
negligence. 
As
a
practical
matter,
proving
gross
negligence
is
difficult.
Complicating
the
issue
is
confusion
over
43whether
the
exculpatory
clause
protects
the
operator
from
negligence,
not
only
in
the
operational
sense 
but
also
in
the
conduct
of
so-called
administrative
matters.
For
example,
an
operational
mistake
may 
include
drilling
on
the
wrong
property,
allowing
accidents
to
occur
during
the
operation,
delays
in
drilling 
or
producing
hydrocarbons,
and
wasting
money.
Administrative
errors
include
negotiating 
disadvantageous
service
contracts,
losing
leases
due
to
delays
or
other
errors,
and
bad
accounting 
practices. 
For
years,
debate
raged
as
to
whether
the
exculpatory
clause
protected
the
operator
from
all
errors, 
meaning
both
operational
and
administrative
errors
or
operational
negligence
only.
In
2012,
the
Texas 
Supreme
Court
held
in
Reeder
v.
Wood
Cnty.
Energy
LLC
,
395
S.W.3d
789
(Tex.
2012),
opinion 
supplemented
on
reh’g
(Mar.
29,
2013),
that
the
exculpatory
clause
applies
to
both
operational
and 
administrative
activities
undertaken
by
the
operator.
Consequently,
the
rule
in
Texas
is
that
under
the 
current
(and
unmodified)
AAPL
form,
the
operator
is
not
subject
to
liability
for
its
operational
and 
administrative
errors
absent
gross
negligence—a
hard
standard
for
a
plaintiff
to
meet. 
Whether
the
Reeder
court’s
logic
will
be
followed
by
other
courts
remains
to
be
seen,
but
its
holding
is
at 
least
not
illogical.
Modifying
the
contract
form
would
remove
any
doubt
as
to
the
scope
of
the
operator’s 
protection
under
the
exculpatory
clause.
One
possible
change
is
as
follows. 
 
Operator
shall
conduct
its
activities
under
this
agreement
as
a
reasonable
prudent
operator,
in
a 
good
and
workmanlike
manner,
with
due
diligence
and
dispatch,
in
accordance
with
good
oilfield 
practice,
and
in
compliance
with
applicable
law
and
regulations,
but
in
no
event
shall
it
have
any 
liability
as
Operator
to
the
other
parties
for
losses
sustained
or
liabilities
incurred
in
connection 
with
any
operational
and/or
administrative
matter
pertaining
to
its
activities
under
this
agreement 
except
such
as
may
result
from
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct. 
This
change
confirms
that
all
activities
undertaken
by
the
operator
are
subject
to
the
gross
negligence 
standard.
It
also
removes
the
requirement
to
perform
in
a
“good
and
workmanlike
manner.”
Whether
any 
obligation
for
the
operator
to
perform
in
a
“good
and
workmanlike”
manner
is
still
useful
is
subject
to 
serious
question.
If
the
operator’s
standard
of
conduct
is
to
be
expressed
in
negative
terms
(i.e.,
unless 
caused
by
gross
negligence),
the
affirmative
duty
to
perform
in
a
good
and
workmanlike
manner
would 
seem
superfluous. 
Removing
the
Operator
Once
the
operator
has
been
selected,
it
typically
cannot
be
removed
without
“good
cause.”
Specifically, 
Article
V.A.,
“designation
and
responsibilities
of
operator,”
page
4
of
the
AAPL
Form
610–1989:
Model 
Form
Operating
Agreement,
provides,
“Operator
may
be
removed
only
for
good
cause
by
the
affirmative 
vote
of
Non-Operators
owning
a
majority
interest
based
on
ownership
...
remaining
after
excluding
the 
voting
interest
of
Operator.”
9
“Good
cause”
is
defined
under
the
form
as
“not
only
gross
negligence
or 
willful
misconduct
but
also
the
material
breach
of
or
inability
to
meet
the
standards
of
operation
contained 
in
Article
V.A.
or
material
failure
or
inability
to
perform
its
obligations
under
this
agreement.”
10
This 
standard
is
a
relatively
onerous
one,
as
the
nonoperators
cannot
simply
remove
operators
that
fall
into 
disfavor,
even
with
a
majority
vote
of
the
nonoperating
interest
owners.
Accordingly,
the
clear
message
to 
the
nonoperators
is
to
be
careful
when
entering
into
a
JOA
with
a
particular
operator
and,
whenever 
possible,
to
choose
the
operator
very
carefully.
As
with
all
contracts,
one
should
only
enter
into 
agreements
with
trustworthy
parties. 
The
Operator
as
“Independent
Contractor”
Under
the
JOA,
the
operator
functions
as
an
independent
contractor.
In
the
context
of
a
JOA,
the 
independent
contractor
provision
provides
an
important
protection
to
the
nonoperating
interest
owners—it 
can
help
to
minimize
the
risk
that
a
court
would
determine
that
any
nonoperating
interest
owner
acted 
negligently
in
causing
an
injury
or
other
casualty.
The
independent
contractor
language
in
the
AAPL
form 
states
as
follows. 
 
In
its
performance
of
services
hereunder
for
the
Non-Operators,
Operator
shall
be
an
independent 
contractor
not
subject
to
the
control
or
direction
of
the
Non-Operators
except
as
to
the
type
of
44operation
to
be
undertaken
in
accordance
with
the
election
procedures
contained
in
this 
agreement. 
A
successful
“independent
contractor
defense”
exculpates
nonoperators
from
liability
when
the
operator 
(their
independent
contractor)
handles
the
details
of
operations.
Although
a
nonoperator
generally
will
not 
have
tort
liability
to
a
third
party,
if
a
nonoperator
is
brought
into
a
lawsuit
along
with
the
operator,
the 
nonoperator
can
point
to
the
former’s
independent
contractor
status
as
a
defense
to
liability. 
While
the
independent
contractor
provision
in
the
AAPL
form
is
probably
sufficient,
the
careful 
nonoperator
interest
owner
may
wish
to
modify
it
to
a
more
robust
version.
The
following
provides
an 
example
of
one
such
modification. 
 
In
its
performance
of
services
here
under
this
agreement
for
the
Non-Operators
,
Operator
shall
be 
an
independent
contractor
not
subject
to
the
control
or
direction
of
the
Non-Operators
except
as
to 
the
type
of
operation
to
be
undertaken
in
accordance
with
the
election
procedures
contained
in 
this
agreement;
and
Operator
shall
have
control
and
management
of
all
operations,
the
selection 
of
employees
and
the
fixing
of
their
hours
of
labor,
and
no
right
is
reserved
to
any
Non-Operator 
to
direct
or
control
the
manner
in
which
the
operations
are
performed,
as
distinguished
from
the 
result
to
be
accomplished
. 
Although
the
operator
functions
as
an
independent
contractor,
the
parties
would
be
unwise
to
ignore
the 
talents
and
opinions
of
the
nonoperators;
after
all,
their
collective
expertise
and
experience
is
one
of
the 
reasons
the
owners
banded
together
in
the
first
place.
And
while
every
organization
needs
a
leader, 
nonoperators
should
involve
themselves
in
setting
certain
standards
and
expectations
for
the
operator. 
Therefore,
the
nonoperators
should
investigate
and
comment
on
the
qualifications
of
consultants
that
are 
hired,
the
protections
included
with
service
contracts,
and
the
operator’s
compliance
with
regulatory 
agencies’
directives.
The
added
attention—provided
it
is
not
overly
aggressive
or
disruptive—will
likely 
increase
protection
for
the
joint
account
and
reduce
the
chances
for
unwelcome
surprises. 
Claims
Management
The
standard
form
JOA
does
not
specify
how
the
potentially
numerous
strategy
decisions
concerning 
litigation
should
be
made.
This
silence
can
cause
the
interest
owners
to
become
misaligned
in
third-party 
litigation.
Even
the
first
step
in
any
lawsuit—selecting
an
attorney—can
be
difficult
when
interest
owners 
likely
have
their
own
attorney
contacts
and
often
have
differing
opinions
as
to
who
should
represent
their 
interests. 
The
parties
should
acknowledge
at
least
the
theoretical
potential
for
litigation,
including
the
possibility
of 
misalignment
among
the
interest
owners
that
can
result.
The
best
way
to
address
that
concern
is
to
modify 
the
JOA
with
a
claims/litigation
annex
that
addresses
numerous
issues
that
arise
in
the
context
of 
third-party
claims,
including
decision
making,
document
production,
third-party
statements,
settlement 
authority,
and
internal
disputes.
The
JOA
should
be
adjusted
to
account
for
the
parties’
risk
tolerance
and 
management
styles.
While
there
is
no
right
answer,
the
parties
may
wish
to
address
issues
similar
to
the 
following. 
•
Method
of
communication
with
the
joint
account
attorney
•
Protocol
for
dealing
with
subpoenas
and
document
requests
•
Statements
made
to
the
media
and
in
court
documents
•
Postponing
the
gross
negligence
determination
•
Private
arbitration
•
Confirming
rules
on
joint
interest
bill
(JIB)
payments
•
Providing
reasonable
control
and
settlement
authority
up
front
Each
of
these
issues
is
discussed
below
in
greater
detail. 
45Decide
the
Method
of
Communication
with
the
Joint
Account
Attorney
The
operator
may
serve
as
a
single
point
of
contact
between
the
interest
owners
and
the
attorney.
This 
approach
will
often
provide
the
added
benefit
of
a
helpful
collaboration
between
the
attorney
and
the 
entity
with
the
best
access
to
documents
and
witnesses
necessary
for
most
litigation.
The
operator, 
however,
may
have
little
or
no
ownership
interest,
leaving
the
operator
unauthorized
to
direct
the 
attorney’s
handling
of
the
case.
The
lawyer
for
the
joint
account
may
also
face
a
complicated
relationship 
with
multiple
clients. 
Various
interest
owners
can
also
bring
value
to
litigation
with
their
assorted
resources,
contacts,
and 
experience.
Many
interest
owners
have
already
experienced
litigation
and
can
recommend
competent 
attorneys
from
prior
cases.
Additionally,
interest
owners
may
have
accountants
or
other
experts
in-house 
or
as
vendors
that
can
provide
helpful
assistance
to
a
case
and
perhaps
are
already
familiar
with
the 
relevant
facts
of
the
litigation. 
Create
a
Protocol
for
Dealing
with
Subpoenas
and
Document
Requests
In
the
context
of
an
underlying
third-party
lawsuit,
nonoperators
will
likely
have
to
respond
to
subpoenas. 
The
nonoperators
should
be
required
to
pass
all
subpoenas
to
the
operator’s
legal
counsel
for
response
or, 
alternatively,
must
agree
to
allow
to
have
their
responses
screened
for
privilege.
Moreover,
the
operator 
should
be
free
to
cooperate
with
governmental
organizations,
including
producing
sensitive
documents 
where
required.
The
JOA
can
provide
that
the
operator
may
do
so,
as
long
as
appropriate
confidentiality 
concerns
are
addressed. 
Be
Careful
with
the
Statements
Made
to
Media
and
in
Court
Documents
In
the
context
of
an
underlying
third-party
claim
and
a
concurrent
(or
at
least
possible)
nonoperator 
lawsuit
against
the
operator,
nonoperators
sometimes
indirectly
harm
their
own
interests
by
making 
statements
(either
in
the
media
or
in
pleadings
filed
by
their
attorneys
in
separate
litigation)
that
are 
critical
of
the
operator.
This
approach
should
be
avoided.
It
behooves
the
joint
account
to
maintain
a 
united
front
(i.e.,
not
airing
dirty
laundry
in
front
of
underlying
plaintiffs,
maintaining
confidentiality,
and 
not
creating
“bad”
documents). 
Certainly,
a
nonoperator
that
thinks
that
the
operator
breached
its
duty
has
a
right
and
perhaps
an 
obligation
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
an
operator.
But
all
of
the
parties
to
the
JOA
can
protect
themselves 
by
agreeing
in
advance
to
a
protocol
that
minimizes
damage
to
the
joint
account
while
preserving
all
of 
the
parties’
rights.
The
ultimate
goal
here
is
for
the
joint
account,
despite
what
internal
differences
it
may 
have,
to
speak
with
one
voice. 
A
process
should
be
developed
by
which
any
press
releases
are
made
only
by
the
operator
and
always 
with
the
express
agreement
of
the
nonoperator’s
representatives. 
Postpone
the
Gross
Negligence
Determination
Some
important
questions
surrounding
gross
negligence
allegations,
especially
when
brought
by
an 
underlying
third-party
plaintiff,
should
be
addressed
proactively
in
the
JOA.
For
example,
the
JOA
should 
address
where
it
is
to
be
decided
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
gross
negligence
standard.
Is
it
the 
jury
or
judge
in
the
underlying
third-party
case?
Or
should
it
be
the
judge
or
the
jury
in
a
concurrent
(or 
later)
lawsuit
between
the
operator
and
nonoperators?
Relatedly,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
as
to
whom
the 
operator’s
duty
is
owed.
Does
the
operator
owe
third
parties
a
specific
duty
that
is
judged
under
the
gross 
negligence
standard,
or
is
that
standard
only
applied
to
nonoperators?
While
this
issue
cannot
be 
completely
controlled
within
the
JOA,
some
clarity
within
the
exculpatory
clause
could
be
achieved. 
Perhaps
the
most
important
issue
to
be
addressed
in
a
JOA’s
dispute
resolution
provision
is
whether
any 
gross
negligence
determination
that
may
be
sought
by
either
the
operator
or
the
nonoperators
is 
specifically
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
final
outcome
of
any
underlying
third-party
trial.
That
way, 
parties
to
the
JOA
will
not
feel
compelled
to
marshal
evidence
and
make
assertions
regarding
the 
operator’s
gross
negligence;
that
would
only
inure
to
the
underlying
plaintiffs’
benefit
and
ultimately 
increase
the
exposure
of
all
of
the
parties
to
the
JOA
if
the
operator
is
not
found
to
be
grossly
negligent
in
46the
third-party
proceeding. 
Plan
for
Private
Arbitration
The
JOA
could
contain
a
dispute
resolution
provision
under
which
the
parties
contractually
reserve
the 
right
to
bring
gross
negligence
claims
against
the
operator
until
such
a
time
as
the
plaintiffs
would
not 
benefit
from
that
action.
The
parties
could
even
agree
to
file
for
private
arbitrations
with
a
preselected 
panel
or
potential
panel,
with
the
requirement
that
the
arbitration
proceedings
are
stayed
pending
a
final 
outcome
of
the
underlying
suit.
That
way,
no
one
has
to
worry
about
losing
any
rights
due
to
a
statute
of 
limitations
(also
known
as
prescription
under
Louisiana
law). 
Confirm
the
Rules
on
JIB
Payments
One
very
practical
matter
that
should
be
determined
contractually
is
to
decide
whether
the
payment
of 
joint
interest
bills
(JIBs)
continues
when
an
underlying
third-party
claim
is
ongoing.
Some
nonoperators 
believe
that
it
is
practical
and
just
to
withhold
payment
of
JIBs
where
they
believe
the
operator’s
grossly 
negligent
conduct
caused
damages
to
the
nonoperators.
Operators,
on
the
other
hand,
contend
that
they 
should
not
have
to
front
money
and
carry
nonoperators
based
only
on
the
mere
allegation
of
grossly 
negligent
conduct. 
An
operator-centric
addition
to
a
JOA
would
require
the
payment
of
JIBs
pursuant
to
the
JOA
and/or 
Council
of
Petroleum
Accountants
Societies
(COPAS)
without
any
attempted
“setoff”
(“compensation” 
under
Louisiana
law)
and
with
all
of
the
parties’
rights
to
reimbursement
preserved
until
disposition
of
the 
underlying
third-party
claim.
Many
nonoperators,
especially
those
with
significant
litigious
experience, 
might
initially
reject
this
approach.
But
from
a
utilitarian
standpoint,
it
makes
sense
for
all
of
the
parties 
to
continue
to
contribute
their
proportionate
shares
of
expenses,
which
ensures
that
the
joint
account 
remains
solvent
and
that
the
operator
does
not
either
run
out
of
money
itself
or
decline
to
pay
any
further 
bills;
either
approach
would
cause
damage
to
the
joint
account. 
Provide
Reasonable
Control
and
Settlement
Authority
Up
Front
The
parties
to
a
JOA
should
decide—well
before
litigation
or
other
disputes
occur—how
decisions 
regarding
the
litigation
or
disputes
will
be
made
and
how
much
authority
will
be
provided
to
the
operator. 
When
handling
the
logistics
of
third-party
claims,
most
JOAs
specify
that
the
nonoperator
may
not 
“unreasonably”
withhold
consent
to
settlement.
Even
when
not
specified
in
the
JOA,
some
courts
have 
implied
this
duty.
The
practical
key
here
is
to
give
the
operator
reasonable
settlement
authority;
$5,000
or 
even
$25,000
in
authority
simply
does
not
make
sense
when
settlement
of
most
third-party
claims
will 
exceed
such
amounts.
If
the
operator
is
to
be
firmly
in
control
of
the
day-to-day
operations,
including 
handling
the
logistics
of
third-party
claims,
it
should
be
given
the
realistic
authority
to
do
that
job. 
Experience
teaches
that
an
operator
that
becomes
subject
to
micromanagement
in
the
handling
of
claims 
is
less
efficient
and
sometimes
less
effective
(due
to
the
effect
of
decision
making
by
committee). 
Consequently,
a
claims
management
plan
should
answer
the
following
questions. 
•
Can
the
operator
make
the
initial
settlement
decision,
subject
only
to
veto
of
a
supermajority
of 
nonoperators?
•
Or,
should
every
decision
be
the
subject
of
a
vote?
•
And,
if
a
vote
is
to
be
made,
do
the
parties
merely
calculate
voting
power
based
on
percentage
of 
ownership?
The
latter
approach
might
favor
the
biggest
block
of
like-minded
interest
owners;
but
it
often
leads
to 
myopic
decision
making
and
does
not
take
account
of
the
broad
experience
of
other
nonoperators.
When 
decisions
are
made
by
a
majority
vote
according
to
ownership
interest,
this
often
means
the
one
or
two 
interest
owners
with
the
largest
percentage
of
ownership
will
end
up
driving
all
litigation
decisions.
If
10 
owners
each
own
a
10
percent
interest,
however,
the
litigation
can
become
difficult
to
manage
absent
a 
consensus
about
how
to
defend
or
prosecute
a
case.
Setting
some
ground
rules
in
the
JOA
regarding 
control
of
third-party
claims
and
settlement
authority
for
such
claims
is
a
practical
way
to
ensure
claims 
are
handled
effectively
and
efficiently.

Drilling
Contracts
Oil
and
gas
drilling
operations
present
the
potential
for
significant
bodily
injury,
property
damage,
and 
lost
revenue.
In
the
absence
of
a
contract
controlling
the
parties’
rights
and
responsibilities,
a
judge
or
a 
jury
will
allocate
any
damages
that
result
from
those
operations
based
on
applicable
law.
Many 
companies
involved
in
drilling
operations,
however,
are
uncomfortable
with
the
uncertainty
of
such
an
“at 
law”
risk
allocation
model
for
several
reasons. 
•
Exactly
what
is
the
applicable
law
is
not
always
clear.
States
apply
various
formulations
for 
determining
which
law
should
apply
to
a
controversy,
and
the
law
that
ultimately
applies
to
a 
controversy
can
significantly
impact
the
outcome.
•
Determinations
by
juries
and
judges
can
be
unpredictable,
creating
additional
uncertainty
as
to 
both
the
amount
of
the
loss
and
its
allocation.
•
Allocating
risk
of
loss
through
a
contract
reduces
uncertainty
and—when
the
contract
works
as 
designed—keeps
legal
costs
low.
Consequently,
many
opt
to
allocate
the
risk
of
the
operations
by
means
of
a
written
contract.
No
contract 
or
insurance
program
can
eliminate
risk,
but
understanding
the
risks
can
allow
for
proper
planning
and 
mitigation
through
insurance
and
contractual
risk
transfer. 
Drilling
contracts
do
not
stand
alone,
however,
and
other
supporting
contracts
must
be
consistent
in
terms 
of
risk
allocation
mechanisms
and
approach
to
avoid
potentially
dangerous
gaps
in
protection.
Standard 
contract
forms
should
be
modified
to
account
for
the
parties’
expectations.
And
indemnity
obligations 
must
be
backed
up
with
the
correct
insurance,
including
the
basic
insurance
protections
required
for
all
oil 
and
gas
industry
service
contracts,
as
well
as
the
insurance
for
the
particular
risks
presented
by
drilling 
operations. 
This
chapter
explains
customary
risk
allocation
arrangements
in
contracts
between
operators
and
drilling 
contractors,
pitfalls
in
drafting
those
arrangements,
and
the
insurance
protections
that
dovetail
with
those 
arrangements.

The
Role
of
Custom
in
Drilling
Contracts
Throughout
the
years,
operators
and
drilling
contractors
have
developed
a
general
understanding 
regarding
which
party
will
assume
responsibility
for
certain
risks.
These
customary
approaches
to
risk 
allocation
have
both
positive
and
negative
implications.
On
the
one
hand,
when
the
operator
and
drilling 
contractor
enter
into
negotiations,
each
party
understands
the
broad
categories
of
risk
that
the
other
will 
likely
seek
to
allocate.
Industry
tradition
has
thus
created
a
largely
well-defined
starting
point
that
shapes 
the
parties’
expectations
from
the
beginning
of
the
negotiation.
On
the
other
hand,
some
parties
remain 
unyielding,
even
formulaic,
in
their
approach
to
negotiating
risk
allocation
provisions.
Some
parties 
automatically
resist
any
modification
whatsoever
to
their
desired
risk
structure.
This
mind-set
could 
stymie
negotiations. 
It
would
be
unfair
and
overly
simplistic
to
categorize
the
tendency
to
resist
modifications
in
risk
structure 
as
mere
obstinacy.
There
are
at
least
two
very
good
reasons
to
refuse
even
slight
modifications
in
risk 
allocation. 
•
Risk
allocation
in
one
contract
impacts
a
party’s
exposure
in
others
(and
vice
versa).
•
Courts
and
legislatures
have
created
rules
regarding
risk
allocation
that
require
strict
adherence
to 
formulaic
approaches
or
specific
language.
These
issues
are
discussed
in
more
detail
later
in
the
chapter. 
Despite
their
power,
custom
and
tradition
have
left
significant
risk
allocation
issues
unsettled.
Parties
to
a 
drilling
contract
must
be
prepared
to
approach
risk
allocation
issues
with
attention
to
detail
and
a
deep 
understanding
of
both
the
oil
and
gas
industry
and
the
law
surrounding
it. 
The
Significant
Impact
of
the
IADC
The
International
Association
of
Drilling
Contractors
(IADC),
briefly
mentioned
in
Chapter
1,
is
a 
worldwide
trade
organization
for
drilling
contractors.
One
of
its
many
functions
is
to
provide
contract 
forms
for
daywork,
turnkey,
and
footage
drilling
contracts. 
•
Daywork
contract:
The
contractor
gets
paid
a
fixed
amount
per
day
regardless
of
how
many
feet 
are
drilled.
•
Turnkey
contract:
The
contractor
must
drill
to
a
certain
depth
in
order
to
get
paid.
•
Footage
contract:
The
contractor
gets
paid
per
foot
drilled.
The
latest
versions
of
these
contract
forms
were
published
in
2013,
but
the
2003
form
discussed
in
this 
chapter
is
still
the
form
most
commonly
used.
These
forms
are
available
for
purchase
to
members
and 
nonmembers
of
the
IADC.
They
establish
an
overarching
framework
and
starting
point
that
allow
the 
parties
to
insert
their
own
commercial
terms
and
other
modifications
that
meet
the
parties’
particular 
needs. 
It
would
be
naïve
and
impractical
to
ignore
the
significant
presence
of
IADC
forms
in
the
drilling
contract 
market.
IADC
contract
forms—particularly
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract
—serve
as
the
basis
of
the 
vast
majority
of
negotiated
drilling
contracts,
along
with
other
contract
documents
that
are
similar
to
the 
IADC
form.
Larger
exploration
and
production
companies
have
their
own
forms,
but
even
these
forms
49implicitly
acknowledge
the
IADC
forms
with
parallel
provisions.
Consequently,
this
section
addresses 
issues
common
to
the
IADC
forms
and
uses
them
as
a
frame
of
reference. 
The
IADC
contract
forms
provide
an
excellent
framework
for
risk
allocation.
However,
these
contract 
forms
must
be
modified
to
fit
the
parties’
particular
situation
and
jurisdictional
requirements.
Moreover, 
the
IADC
forms
are
fraught
with
potential
ambiguities
regarding
liability
to
third
parties,
damage
to
the 
drilling
rig
due
to
a
faulty
drilling
site,
pollution,
and
other
issues.
The
insurance
requirements
listed
in 
Exhibit
A
of
the
forms
provide
only
a
starting
point.
Consequently,
parties
should
avoid
signing
an 
unmodified
IADC
contract. 
Satisfactory
contract
negotiation
begins
with
understanding
how
the
contract
is
designed
to
work.
Only 
then
can
one
explain
why
certain
changes
are
being
requested. 
Basic
Principles
of
Risk
Allocation
In
a
drilling
operation,
the
drilling
contractor’s
employees
and
costly
equipment—including
the
drilling 
rig—are
all
at
risk.
The
operator
generally
has
fewer
direct
employees
and
less
equipment
at
the
drilling 
site,
but
its
investment
in
the
entire
project
(including
initial
research
and
well
planning)
is
at
stake.
The 
operator’s
rights
in
the
lease
(including
the
reservoir
of
hydrocarbons
and
the
legal
right
to
explore
for 
and
extract
those
hydrocarbons
from
the
ground)
are
also
at
stake.
Moreover,
once
the
operation
has 
begun,
the
operator’s
cumulative
payments
toward
the
entire
operation—payments
to
the
drilling 
contractor
and
other
service
contractors—are
all
at
risk.
Considering
the
stakes
for
all
the
players
and
the 
inherent
danger
in
the
operations,
the
significant
attention
that
risk
allocation
provisions
receive—or,
at 
least,
should
receive—is
well
founded. 
Uncertainty
of
the
“At
Law”
Framework
Casualties
often
occur
in
the
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
industry.
Consequently,
litigation
is 
also
common.
The
legal
landscape
in
most
jurisdictions
requires
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
contract,
each 
party
is
liable
for
the
damages
that
result
from
its
fault.
This
arrangement
is
commonly
referred
to
as
“at 
law”
risk
allocation. 
It
is
often
difficult
and
very
expensive
to
determine
the
extent
of
each
party’s
fault
in
causing
a
particular 
casualty.
Even
when
fault
has
been
determined,
the
amount
of
damages
ultimately
payable
may
depend 
on
an
unpredictable
jury’s
perception
of
an
individual’s
loss
or
which
party’s
expert
is
more
persuasive
to 
the
judge.
As
a
result,
oil
and
gas
casualty
litigation
is
usually
very
expensive,
time
consuming,
and 
uncertain. 
The
Industry’s
Desire
for
Certainty
Major
participants
in
the
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
industry
found
that
allocating
risk
on
the 
basis
of
ownership
of
the
people
and
property
involved
in
the
casualty,
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
fault, 
could
introduce
a
moderate
level
of
certainty,
time
savings,
and
cost
reduction
in
the
handling
of 
litigation. 
The
method
chosen
to
implement
this
plan
was
to
allocate
risks
without
regard
to
fault
and
assign
risks
of 
casualty
to
the
employer
of
the
injured
personnel
or
the
owner
of
the
damaged
property.
As
with
other 
no-fault
schemes,
the
expectation
was
that,
if
each
participant
in
the
operation
accepted
responsibility
for 
any
loss
to
its
equipment
or
personnel
without
regard
to
fault,
then
in
the
event
of
an
accident,
there 
would
be
no
squabbling
over
fault,
litigation
could
be
avoided,
executives’
and
senior
officers’
time 
would
not
be
wasted
in
depositions,
legal
costs
would
be
reduced,
and
business
relationships
would
be 
preserved.
Moreover,
each
party
would
have
a
better
idea
of
the
type
and
limits
of
insurance
coverage
that 
it
needs. 
“Knock-for-Knock”
Indemnity
With
guidance
from
the
courts,
the
oil
and
gas
industry
arrived
at
various
contractual
formulations
to 
implement
the
intent
that
each
party
would
ultimately
bear
the
cost
of
any
loss
to
its
own
personnel
or 
property.
Over
time,
this
arrangement
began
to
be
known
loosely
as
a
“knock-for-knock”
indemnity.
50Knock-for-knock,
however,
means
different
things
to
different
people,
and
there
are
various
forms
of 
so-called
knock-for-knock
indemnities. 
The
industry
shorthand
for
a
knock-for-knock
indemnity
is,
“You
take
your
people
and
property,
and
I 
take
mine.”
That
description
begs
two
critical
questions
about
the
scope
and
breadth
of
the
indemnity 
obligation. 
•
First,
who
are
“your
people”
and
who
are
“mine”?
In
other
words,
is
each
party’s
obligation 
limited
to
indemnifying
the
other
party
for
injury
to
the
former’s
own
payroll
employees
and 
damage
only
to
property
actually
in
the
party’s
name?
Or
does
the
obligation
extend
to 
indemnifying
for
injury
or
damage
to
the
contractors
and
subcontractors
of
the
indemnitor
and 
their
employees
as
well?
•
Second,
the
shorthand
description
also
fails
to
answer
the
question,
“Whom
does
each
party
have 
to
indemnify?”
Only
the
other
party
itself?
Or
the
other
party
and
its
contractors,
subcontractors, 
and
joint
venturers?
The
breadth
of
the
indemnity
obligations
and
the
impact
on
each
party’s
overall
risk
allocation
program 
(the
interplay
between
and
among
all
of
the
parties’
contracts)
depend
on
the
answers
to
those
two 
questions.
Which
of
three
knock-for-knock
indemnity
models
the
parties
will
choose
depends
on
factors 
such
as
each
company’s
contracting
philosophy,
its
market
leverage,
its
other
contracts,
the
availability
of 
insurance
coverage,
and
the
law
likely
to
be
applied
to
a
casualty. 
Models
of
Knock-for-Knock
Indemnity
There
are
essentially
three
models:
a
narrow
reciprocal
indemnity,
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity,
and
a 
modified
reciprocal
indemnity.
11
In
sum,
these
models
work
as
follows. 
•
Narrow
reciprocal
indemnity
:
Each
party
accepts
responsibility
for
loss
to
its
own
people
and 
property.
The
protection
only
covers
claims
for
injury
or
property
damage
to
the
parties
and
their 
direct
employees.
Protection
is
extended
to
the
indemnitee
only;
the
indemnitee’s
contractors
and 
subcontractors
do
not
receive
the
benefit
of
the
indemnity.
Under
this
approach,
the
parties
elect
to 
answer
both
of
the
above
questions
narrowly.
•
Broad
reciprocal
indemnity
:
Each
party
accepts
responsibility
for
loss
to
its
own
people
and 
property
and
for
the
people
and
property
of
its
contractors
and
subcontractors.
Additionally,
the 
protection
is
extended
to
the
other
party
(as
indemnitee)
as
well
as
its
contractors
and 
subcontractors.
Pursuant
to
this
arrangement,
the
parties
answer
both
of
the
above
questions
by 
providing
broad
protections.
Even
within
the
framework
of
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity,
the 
parties
may
make
the
protections
more
or
less
broad.
For
example,
some
broad
reciprocals
include 
customers,
clients,
invitees,
or
others
within
the
scope
of
one
or
both
sides
of
the
equation. 
Therefore,
parties
must
not
only
determine
whether
the
indemnity
is
a
broad
reciprocal
but
also 
answer
the
question,
“How
broad
is
it?”
•
Modified
reciprocal
indemnity
:
This
is
a
catchall
term
for
a
hybrid
of
the
two
models
discussed 
above.
It
has
some
elements
of
a
broad
reciprocal
and
some
elements
of
a
narrow
reciprocal.
In
one 
version,
one
party
accepts
responsibility
only
for
loss
to
its
own
people
and
property
and
extends 
that
protection
to
the
indemnitee
as
well
as
its
contractors
and
subcontractors.
The
other
party, 
however,
indemnifies
a
broad
group
of
indemnitees
for
loss
to
the
indemnitor’s
own
people
and 
property,
as
well
as
the
people
and
property
of
its
contractors/subcontractors.
Sometimes
contracts
include
subtle
modifications
to
the
overarching
model.
At
first
glance,
an
indemnity 
provision
may
appear
to
provide
a
straightforward
approach
(either
narrow
or
broad),
but
hidden
in
the 
details
is
a
modification
that
drastically
changes
the
scope
of
one
party’s
protection
and/or
the
other’s 
obligation.
Some
of
these
exceptions,
or
carve-outs,
are
discussed
later
in
the
chapter. 
Third-Party
Claims:
People
and
Property
That
Are
Neither
Yours
Nor
Mine
The
knock-for-knock
approach
does
not
address
claims
for
injury
or
damage
to
true
third
parties,
i.e.,
51nonparties
to
the
contract
and
other
entities
that
are
not
included
within
the
breadth
of
the
indemnity.
This 
may
include
governmental
agents,
neighboring
land
owners,
passersby,
and
even
trespassers.
For
the
most 
part,
both
drilling
contractors
and
operators
expect
that
responsibility
for
claims
by
true
third
parties
will 
remain
“at
law.”
Some
drilling
contractors,
however,
seek
to
shift
responsibility
for
all
third-party
claims 
to
the
operator
regardless
of
fault,
arguing
that
the
operator’s
return
on
the
drilling
operation
justifies
this 
shift
of
responsibility.
Operators,
on
the
other
hand,
typically
oppose
that
type
of
broad
shift
because,
as 
relates
to
claims
by
third
parties
due
to
the
drilling
contractor’s
fault,
the
operator
has
no
control
over 
either
the
drilling
contractor’s
methods
or
the
tort
victim
and
thus
may
not
be
able
to
insure
the
risk. 
One
typical
approach
is
to
have
reciprocal
provisions
in
which
each
party
simply
agrees
to
indemnify
the 
other
for
such
third-party
damage,
essentially
leaving
allocation
of
third-party
damage
to
the
statutory
or 
jurisprudential
law
selected
by
the
parties.
Depending
on
the
jurisdiction,
that
approach
may
be 
acceptable.
However,
it
is
probably
a
better
idea
to
specifically
say
that
each
party
shall
be
responsible
for 
third-party
damage
but
only
to
the
extent
it
is
caused
by
that
party. 
Depending
on
the
companies’
philosophies,
this
dispute
can
destroy
the
negotiations.
In
most
situations, 
however,
the
parties
agree
to
allocate
responsibility
only
for
certain
categories
of
third-party
claims,
such 
as
pollution. 
“Magic
Language”:
Drafting
Indemnification
Provisions
That
Apply
Regardless
of 
Fault
Once
the
parties
have
agreed
on
the
risk
allocation,
they
need
to
ensure
that
(to
the
extent
possible
under 
applicable
law)
the
language
effectively
applies
to
all
claims
regardless
of
fault,
even
the
fault
of
the 
indemnitee.
Originally,
the
contractual
formulation
for
expressing
that
intent
was
simple
and
rather 
straightforward,
as
follows. 
 
Each
party
to
this
Contract
shall
be
responsible
for
and
indemnify
the
other
for
all
claims
of 
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising
out
of
the
contract,
howsoever
caused. 
The
parties
expected
that
this
language
effectively
expressed
their
intent
that
responsibility
for
any 
casualty
belongs
to
the
owner
of
the
damaged
property
or
to
the
employer
of
the
injured
personnel. 
Courts,
however,
demonstrated
a
general
hostility
toward
any
provision
in
which
any
party
was
to
be 
indemnified
for
the
consequences
of
its
own
fault.
Construing
indemnity
obligations
strictly
against
the 
indemnitee,
courts
began
to
promulgate
strict
drafting
standards
(which
vary
by
jurisdiction)
to
create
an 
enforceable
indemnity
arrangement.
The
language
that
satisfies
that
standard
is
often
called
“magic 
language.”
The
standards
promulgated
by
the
courts,
particularly
Louisiana,
Texas,
and
the
U.S.
Fifth 
Circuit,
do
not
require
the
use
of
specific
words
or
phrases.
The
intent
for
one
party
to
indemnify
the 
other
for
its
own
negligence,
however,
must
be
expressed
in
clear
and
unequivocal
language.
The
2003 
IADC
Daywork
Contract
provides
language
in
paragraph
14:13
that
would
satisfy
all
jurisdictions.
It
is 
shown
in
Exhibit
5.1.

Daywork
Drilling

U.S.
April
2003,
Paragraph
14.13.
Texas
courts
maintain
the
most
stringent
standards.
Under
the
Texas
Fair
Notice
Doctrine,
the
intent
to 
indemnify
another
party
for
its
own
negligence
must
be
stated
in
clear
and
unequivocal
terms,
with
the 
particular
provision
meeting
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code
definition
of
“conspicuous,”
typically 
requiring
bold
fonts,
separate
headings,
and
other
visual
devices
designed
to
draw
the
reader’s
attention
to 
the
provision. 
Anti-Indemnity
Acts
Contract
language
expressing
the
intent
to
indemnify
without
regard
to
fault
can
be
quite
clear
and 
unequivocal.
Yet,
some
state
legislatures
have
decreed
that,
for
public
policy
reasons,
indemnification
for 
claims
based
on
a
party’s
own
fault
is
contra
bonos
mores
(against
good
morals).
Four
states
have
such 
oil
and
gas
anti-indemnity
acts:
Louisiana,
Texas,
New
Mexico,
and
Wyoming.
To
a
certain
extent,
the 
underpinnings
of
all
of
these
acts
are
(1)
a
belief
that
operators
have
an
unfair
commercial
advantage
over 
contractors
in
the
context
of
oil
and
gas
contracts
and
(2)
the
notion
that
a
party
that
is
responsible
for
the 
results
of
its
own
actions
is
more
likely
to
be
careful
and,
thus,
the
anti-indemnity
act
promotes
safety. 
Each
state’s
act
is
unique. 
Additionally,
approximately
40
states
have
construction
anti-indemnity
acts.
As
of
this
writing,
Louisiana 
is
the
latest
state
to
add
a
construction
anti-indemnity
act,
which
became
enforceable
on
January
1,
2011. 
In
the
Louisiana
act,
as
in
many
other
states’
acts,
the
definition
of
“construction
contract”
is
very
broad. 
The
Louisiana
definition
includes
“any
agreement
for
the
design,
construction,
alteration,
renovation, 
repair,
or
maintenance
of
a
building,
structure,
highway,
road,
bridge,
water
line,
sewer
line,
oil
line,
gas 
line,
appurtenance,
or
other
improvement
to
real
property,
including
any
moving,
demolition,
or 
excavation.”
Although
drilling
contracts
probably
do
not
fall
within
this
definition,
other
service
contracts 
that
share
a
common
workplace
with
the
drilling
operations
may
be
affected
by
a
construction 
anti-indemnity
act. 
Parties
must
carefully
harmonize
the
risk
allocation
arrangements
in
all
contracts
related
to
the
drilling 
operation
to
ensure
that
they
work
together
and
do
not
result
in
exposure
to
unanticipated
risk. 
Applicable
Law
The
law
applicable
to
the
drilling
operation
will—absent
a
contravening
agreement
by
the
parties
and 
subject
to
the
extent
of
freedom
of
contract
applied
by
applicable
law—allocate
fault
in
the
event
of
a 
casualty
and
determine
the
enforceability
of
the
contractual
risk
allocation.
Most
jurisdictions
provide
for 
a
comparative
fault
system;
that
is,
each
party
bears
liability
in
accordance
with
its
percentage
of
fault
in 
causing
the
casualty. 
Applicable
law
becomes
most
important
in
those
states
that
have
anti-indemnity
acts.
The
parties
can 
agree
to
the
risk
allocation
scheme,
only
to
see
it
struck
down
as
being
a
violation
of
applicable
law. 
Moreover,
as
discussed
earlier,
each
jurisdiction
has
its
own
particular
rules,
aside
from
public
policy
53concerns
like
anti-indemnity
acts—rules
for
enforcement
of
indemnity
without
fault. 
Exceptions,
Carve-Outs,
and
Other
Modifying
Provisions
The
basic
risk
allocation
bargain
between
the
operator
and
the
contractor
is
usually
some
sort
of 
reciprocal
knock-for-knock
arrangement—narrow,
broad,
or
modified.
But
the
general
framework
tells 
only
half
of
the
risk
allocation
story.
The
other
half
of
the
story
is
made
up
of
the
many
exceptions, 
carve-outs,
and
other
provisions
that
are
common
to
drilling
contracts.
These
have
a
significant
impact
on 
risk
allocation
and
deserve
special
attention. 
Daywork
Drilling
Contract
Preamble
Many
daywork
drilling
contract
forms
contain
language
in
the
preamble
that
can
have
a
significant
impact 
on
risk
allocation.
For
example,
the
IADC
2003
Daywork
Contract
defines
“daywork
basis”
as
the 
drilling
contractor’s
being
under
the
“direct
supervision
and
control
of
the
operator.”
This
definition 
implies
a
relationship
that
arguably
does
not
(or
should
not)
exist.
It
is
true
that
the
drilling
contractor 
follows
a
drilling
program
that
the
operator’s
engineer
designed.
However,
the
specific
methods
of 
drilling
the
hole
(which
member
of
a
drilling
crew
does
what,
how
fast
to
make
the
hole,
when
to
trip
out 
of
the
hole,
etc.)
are
often,
as
a
practical
matter,
left
to
the
contractor.
Some
operators
view
their
drilling 
contractor
as
the
expert
in
drilling
operations.
Consequently,
the
contract
should
not
reflect
the
operator’s 
direction,
supervision,
and
control
of
the
contractor
but
rather
that
the
contractor
performs
as
requested
by 
the
operator.
In
other
words,
the
contractor
decides
the
details
of
the
drilling
operation,
consistent
with
the 
contractor’s
role
as
an
independent
contractor.
The
parties
should
consider
revising
any
preamble
that 
overstates
the
operator’s
control
of
the
drilling
operations. 
The
IADC
preamble
also
limits
the
contractor’s
obligations
to
those
that
the
contractor
has
“specifically 
assumed.”
This
means
that
the
balance
of
potential
liabilities
is
necessarily
assigned
to
the
operator.
Thus, 
any
risks
that
are
left
unallocated
in
the
indemnity
section
of
the
contract,
such
as
claims
by
true
third 
parties,
are
automatically
allocated
to
the
operator.
Some
parties
prefer
to
allow
the
indemnity
section
of 
the
contract
(paragraph
14
in
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract)
to
exclusively
control
the
parties’ 
indemnity
obligations. 
Thus,
the
parties
can
be
presented
with
several
options
relative
to
the
scope
of
risk
allocation. 
•
Specifically
allocate
in
the
contract’s
indemnity
section
all
risks
of
the
operation.
•
Allocate
only
those
risks
that
involve
the
parties
and
their
contractors/subcontractors
(leaving
the 
issue
of
liability
to
third
parties
to
be
decided
by
applicable
law,
e.g.,
based
on
relative
fault).
•
Allocate,
generally
on
a
reciprocal
basis,
risks
that
involve
the
parties
and
their
contractors
and 
subcontractors,
but
allocate
by
default
third-party
liability
to
the
operator.
“Floating
Magic
Language”
The
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract
also
contains
“floating
magic
language,”
a
provision
(section
14.13) 
that
establishes
that
all
obligations
assumed
in
the
contract
are
regardless
of
fault.
The
language
of
this 
provision
is
shown
in
Exhibit
5.1. 
That
means
that
liabilities
impliedly
left
to
the
operator
(in
the
preamble
and
other
parts
of
the
IADC 
form,
such
as
Article
10,
Sound
Location,
discussed
later
under
the
“Sound
Location
Provisions“ 
heading)
would
apply
regardless
of
the
negligence
of
either
party.
If
this
is
not
what
the
parties
intended, 
they
should
modify
the
indemnity
section
to
limit
“magic
language”
to
apply
as
intended. 
Carve-Outs:
Exceptions
to
the
“Knock-for-Knock”
Arrangement
The
general
knock-for-knock
arrangement
that
the
parties
choose
is
often
subject
to
exceptions
or 
“carve-outs.”
These
carve-outs
are
almost
exclusively
in
the
contractor’s
favor,
requiring
the
operator
to 
be
responsible
for
certain
losses
(or
for
portions
of
those
losses)
that
would
ordinarily
be
for
the 
contractor’s
account.
Typical
carve-outs
include
well
control
costs
and
damage
to
the
contractor’s 
down-hole
tools,
the
hole
itself,
and
the
reservoir.
54Operators
generally
accept
these
exceptions
as
standard
in
the
oil
and
gas
business.
But
the
scope
of
the 
carve-outs
is
not
standard
and
often
causes
disputes
during
negotiation.
The
parties
should
carefully 
examine
the
language
of
the
carve-outs
to
ensure
that
the
scope,
as
expressed,
meets
the
parties’ 
expectations.
The
exceptions
should
not
swallow
the
rule,
and
they
should
allow
both
parties
to
mitigate 
exposure
through
available
insurance. 
Carve-outs
often
state
that
the
exception
applies
to
“all
claims
arising
out
of”
a
particular
event
or 
circumstance
rather
than
“all
claims
for”
a
particular
type
or
category
of
damage.
For
example,
operators 
typically
accept
that
if
there
is
a
blowout,
the
operators
extra
expense/control
of
well
(OEE/COW) 
insurance
will
respond
to
pay
the
cost
to
bring
the
well
in
control,
put
out
fires,
and
redrill
if
necessary. 
However,
operators
do
not
expect
that,
if
personnel
are
injured
in
connection
with
a
blowout,
the
operator 
will
be
responsible
for
bodily
injury
claims
by
the
contractor’s
employees.
That
broader
“arising
out
of” 
language
arguably
expands
the
operator’s
liability
in
the
event
of
a
blowout
to
bodily
injury
claims
by
the 
contractor’s
employees
and
loss
of
the
contractor’s
equipment.
This
would
be
contrary
to
the
intent
of 
both
parties,
who
would
typically
anticipate
that
those
types
of
claims
will
fall
within
the
general
risk 
allocation
arrangement.
The
language
of
the
carve-outs
should
not
create
unintended
ambiguity. 
Another
ambiguity
can
arise
regarding
carve-outs
for
“down-hole
tools.”
It
is
important
to
specify 
whether
the
carve-out
applies
to
all
down-hole
tools
regardless
of
where
they
are
when
damaged
or
(as 
operators
typically
expect)
only
to
those
tools
that
are
damaged
while
actually
in
the
hole,
below
the 
rotary
table. 
In
addition
to
ensuring
that
any
carve-out
provision
is
narrowly
tailored
to
a
particular
category
and 
situation,
an
additional
provision
at
the
end
of
the
carve-out,
shown
in
Exhibit
5.2,
is
recommended. 
55Exhibit
5.2
 
Clarification
of
Carve-Out
Language
This
indemnity
[specify
the
subsection]
shall
in
no
way
limit
or
modify
the
general
indemnities 
contained
within
this
Agreement,
except
as
to
responsibility
for
that
particular
category
of
property 
damage
identified
in
this
subsection,
such
that
any
exceptions
for
particular/discrete
items
of 
property
damage
in
no
way
affect
any
protection,
release,
or
indemnification
for
bodily
injury,
illness, 
death
or
damage
to
other
property.
In
sum,
carve-outs
should
specifically
state
that
they
apply
only
for
the
subject
matter
they
address
and 
that
they
do
not
override
the
balance
of
the
indemnity
obligations. 
Sound
Location
Provisions
The
so-called
sound
location
provision,
which
is
a
typical
feature
of
most
drilling
contracts,
is
a
source
of 
significant
uninsured
liability
for
an
operator.
The
sound
location
provision
of
the
2003
IADC
Daywork 
Contract
(paragraph
10)
is
shown
in

5.3.

It
is
recognized
that

Drilling 
Contract,
U.S.
April
2003,
Paragraph
10.
Paragraph
10
of
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract,
and
similar
sound
location
provisions,
create
the 
potential
of
significant
misunderstandings.
For
the
operator,
they
also
create
the
potential
of
uninsured 
liability. 
Sound
location
provisions
often
assume
the
operator’s
superior
knowledge
of
the
drill
site.
That 
assumption
might
or
might
not
be
valid.
If
the
sound
location
provision
contains
an
affirmative
statement 
as
to
the
operator’s
superior
knowledge,
the
parties
should
consider
modifying
it
to
reflect
that
the 
operator
“might
have”
superior
knowledge
of
the
drill
site
and
has
the
duty
to
advise
the
contractor
of 
“known”
subsurface
conditions
that
may
damage
the
rig. 
Sound
location
provisions
also
place
liability
for
damage
to
the
drilling
rig
on
the
operator.
The
operator, 
however,
might
not
have
insurance
in
the
sufficient
types
and
amounts
necessary
to
avoid
uninsured 
exposure
for
a
catastrophic
incident.
As
discussed
later,
under
the
“Loss
of
the
Drilling
Unit”
heading, 
some
limited
coverage
under
the
OEE/COW
policy,
particularly
in
the
care,
custody,
and
control 
provision,
might
apply
while
the
rig
is
moving
onto
location.
However,
OEE/COW
forms
are
not 
consistent
in
this
regard.
Since
the
drilling
contractor
will
have
first-party
property
insurance
on
its
rig, 
the
best
approach
may
be
to
allocate
to
the
operator
only
liability
for
the
amount
of
the
contractor’s 
drilling
rig
insurance
deductible. 
Relatedly,
a
typical
sound
location
provision
establishes
that
a
special
rate,
called
the
“force
majeure 
rate,”
applies
during
the
time
the
rig
is
damaged
and
being
repaired.
However,
there
is
no
limit
as
to
how 
long
that
force
majeure
rate
can
run.
Consequently,
the
parties
should
consider
placing
a
cap
on
the 
operator’s
exposure
for
payment
of
the
force
majeure
rate.
For
example,
the
contract
could
specify
that 
the
force
majeure
rate
is
payable
for
a
maximum
of
15
days. 
Termination
of
Location
Liability
Provisions
Many
drilling
contract
forms,
including
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract,
include
a
provision
regarding 
“termination
of
location
liability.”
Paragraph
12
in
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract
recites
that,
once 
the
drilling
contractor
“has
concluded
operations
at
the
well
location,”
it
can
have
no
liability
for
any 
occurrence.
There
are
several
problems
with
this
provision. 
First,
what
does
it
mean
to
“conclude
operations”?
Does
it
mean
that
the
contractor
has
ceased
drilling? 
Does
it
mean
that
the
equipment
is
packed
up?
Or
does
it
mean
that
the
contractor
has
actually
taken
all
of 
its
personnel
and
equipment
from
the
well
site
and
departed
the
area? 
Second,
some
variations
of
the
termination
of
location
liability
provision
require
the
operator
to
restore 
the
location
to
its
previous
condition,
i.e.,
fill
in
holes
and
mud
pits,
level
the
ground,
pick
up
trash,
etc.
If 
that
is
the
intention,
it
should
be
clearly
stated
in
the
contract. 
Third,
many
such
provisions
are,
with
an
unmodified
contract
form,
subject
to
the
“floating
magic
57language”
of
section
14.13,
so
that
they
apply
regardless
of
fault.
The
result
is
that
the
operator
can
have 
liability
for
certain
losses,
even
if
they
result
100
percent
from
the
contractor’s
fault.
If
this
is
not
what
the 
parties
intend,
then
the
contract
should
be
modified
to
more
closely
reflect
their
mutual
intent. 
One
option
to
make
the
parties’
rights
and
obligations
clearer
is
to
specify
that
the
contractor’s
protection 
from
all
liability
“is
subject
to
Contractor’s
compliance
with
reasonable
requests
of
Operator
to
clean
up 
and
restore
the
site”
and
applies
“only
after
all
Contractor
Personnel
and
Equipment
have
been
removed 
from
the
drilling
site
and
are
on
public
roads.”
Furthermore,
if
the
parties
do
not
intend
that
the
contractor 
be
granted
a
free
pass
for
any
liability
arising
from
the
location
(regardless
of
its
fault),
any
contractual 
mechanism
that
ties
the
termination
of
location
liability
provision
to
magic
language
(often
contained 
within
paragraph
14.13)
should
be
stricken. 
Pollution
Typically,
the
drilling
contractor
proposes
that
(1)
it
will
accept
responsibility—without
regard
to 
fault—“for
all
claims,
demands
and
causes
of
action
of
every
kind
and
character
arising
from
pollution 
that
originates
from
above
the
surface
of
the
land,
and
which
is
wholly
in
Contractor’s
possession
and 
control
and
directly
associated
with
Contractor’s
equipment
and
facilities,”
and
(2)
the
operator
shall
be 
responsible
for
all
other
claims
“arising
out
of
or
related
to”
pollution
or
contamination. 
This
approach
has
two
problems.
First,
the
parties’
pollution
indemnity
should
be
narrowed
to
address 
only
“cleanup
and
remediation”
of
pollution
events
and
not
responsibility
for
all
types
of
damage 
(property
damage,
injury,
illness,
or
death),
for
example,
to
land
owners,
the
government,
and
other
third 
parties.
Second,
under
this
scheme,
the
contractor
is
only
responsible
for
pollution
liability
if
three 
requirements
are
met:
(1)
the
pollution
originates
from
above
the
land
surface;
(2)
it
is
wholly
in
the 
contractor’s
possession
and
control;
and
(3)
it
is
directly
associated
with
the
contractor’s
equipment.
That 
approach
creates
a
very
narrow
window
for
the
contractor
ever
to
have
responsibility
for
a
pollution 
event.
Therefore,
operators’
typical
approach
is
to
remove
the
words
“wholly”
and
“directly”
and
to 
replace
the
word
“and”
with
“or.”
These
two
subtle
changes,
shown
in
Exhibit
5.4,
often
provide
an 
acceptable
middle
ground
for
both
parties. 
58Exhibit
5.4
 
Pollution
Indemnity
Provisions
with
Revisions
Contractor
shall
assume
all
responsibility
for,
including
control
and
removal
of,
and
shall
protect, 
defend
and
indemnify
Operator
from
and
against
all
claims,
demands
and
causes
of
action
of
every 
kind
and
character
arising
from
pollution
or
contamination,
which
originates
above
the
surface
of
the 
land
or
water
from
spills
of
fuels,
lubricants,
motor
oils,
pipe
dope,
paints,
solvents,
ballast,
bilge
and 
garbage,
except
unavoidable
pollution
from
reserve
pits,
wholly
in
Contractor’s
possession
and
or 
control
and
or
directly
associated
with
Contractor’s
equipment
and
facilities.
For
some
contractors,
however,
deletion
of
the
“arising
from”
language
causes
problems.
Operators 
typically
do
not
expect
to
take
responsibility
for
third-party
illness,
death,
or
property
damage
that
“arises 
from”
pollution
caused
by
the
contractor.
Rather,
they
expect
that
those
risks
will
be
unallocated
and 
remain
“at
law.”
This
issue
is
causing
increasing
dispute
when
parties
negotiate
these
provisions. 
Warranty
Disclaimers
Many
contractors
insist
on
robust
warranty
disclaimers,
specifically
disclaiming
any
warranty
of
fitness 
for
use
for
a
particular
application
and
providing
that
a
breach
of
the
warranty
subjects
the
contractor
to
a 
maximum
penalty
of
having
to
re-perform
the
work
or
having
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
work.
Exhibit
5.5 
provides
an
example. 
59Exhibit
5.5
 
Sample
Warranty
Disclaimer
Contractor
warrants
that
all
work
provided
under
this
agreement
shall
be
performed
in
a
good
and 
workmanlike
manner
in
accordance
with
good
oilfield
practices
and
in
accordance
with
the 
specifications
contained
in
the
service
order
or
purchase
order.
Contractor
warrants
that
materials 
furnished
under
this
agreement
shall
conform
to
the
quality
and
specifications
represented. 
Contractor
warrants
all
its
products
to
be
free
of
defects
in
material
and
workmanship
for
a
period
of 
six
(6)
months
from
the
date
of
installation
or
twelve
(12)
months
from
the
date
of
delivery, 
whichever
occurs
first.
The
above
warranty
does
not
apply
to
products
that
have
been
modified
by 
anyone
at
Operator’s
request,
supplied
by
Operator
or
purchased
by
Contractor
at
Operator’s 
request,
and/or
that
have
been
subjected
to
improper
handling,
storage,
application,
installation, 
operation
or
maintenance
by
anyone
other
than
Contractor.
Operator’s
sole
remedy
for
breach
of 
this
warranty
provision
is
re-performance
of
defective
work
or
re-supply
of
defective
material.
The 
foregoing
warranties
for
services
and
products
are
in
lieu
of
all
other
warranties,
whether
oral, 
written,
express,
implied
or
statutory.
Implied
warranties
of
fitness
for
a
particular
purpose
and 
merchantability
shall
not
apply.
Operators
generally
accept
these
limited
warranties
and
disclaimers,
but
they
need
to
ensure
that
the 
disclaimers
do
not
override
the
contractor’s
indemnity
and
insurance
obligations.
To
make
sure
that
the 
scope
of
warranty
disclaimers
does
not
impact
the
indemnity
obligations
or
the
insurance
obligations
that 
dovetail
with
the
indemnity
provisions,
operators
should
clarify
by
adding
the
following
italicized 
language:
“
Subject
to
Contractor’s
indemnity
and
insurance
obligations
contained
in
this
agreement, 
Operator’s
sole
remedy
for
breach
of
this
warranty
provision
is
re-performance
of
defective
work
or 
re-supply
of
defective
material.”
This
protects
against
arguments
by
aggressive
litigators
that
losses 
caused
by
a
breach
of
warranty
are
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
indemnity
and
insurance
obligations. 
Independent
Contractor
Provision
An
independent
contractor
provision
stating
that
the
contractor
is
hired
as
an
independent
contractor
and 
that
the
operator
is
interested
only
in
the
results
obtained
can
help
minimize
risks
for
both
parties
by 
emphasizing
that
the
contractor
is
in
charge
of
the
specific
details
of
the
work.
A
sample
provision
is 
provided
in
Exhibit
5.6. 
60Exhibit
5.6
 
Sample
Independent
Contractor
Provision
Contractor
shall
at
all
times
be
an
independent
contractor,
and
nothing
in
this
Contract
shall
be 
construed
as
creating
the
relationship
of
principal
and
agent,
or
employer
or
employee,
between 
Operator
and
Contractor
or
between
Operator
and
Contractor’s
agents
or
employees.
Contractor 
shall
have
no
authority
to
hire
any
persons
on
behalf
of
Operator,
and
any
and
all
persons
whom 
Contractor
may
employ
shall
be
deemed
to
be
solely
the
employees
of
Contractor.
Contractor
shall 
have
control
and
management
of
the
Work,
the
selection
of
employees
and
the
fixing
of
their
hours 
of
labor,
and
no
right
is
reserved
to
Operator
to
direct
or
control
the
manner
in
which
the
Work
is 
performed,
as
distinguished
from
the
result
to
be
accomplished.
Nothing
herein
contained
shall
be 
construed
to
authorize
Contractor
to
incur
any
debt,
liability,
or
obligation
of
any
nature
for
or
on 
behalf
of
Operator.
A
successful
independent
contractor
defense
relieves
the
operator
from
liability
for
claims
caused
by
the 
contractor.
It
means
that
damages
to
third
parties
that
result
from
the
operation
may
not
be
assessed 
against
the
operator,
provided
that
the
operator
did
not
oversee
the
step-by-step
details
of
the
work.
In
the 
context
of
risk
allocation
arrangements
in
most
drilling
contracts,
this
is
good
for
the
contractor
as
well, 
because
it
may
limit
the
exposure
for
which
the
contractor
must
indemnify
the
operator
(i.e.,
claims
by
the 
contractor’s
employees).
Additionally,
this
protection
can
be
particularly
important
for
the
operator
if
the 
indemnity
or
insurance
protection
owed
to
the
operator
is
unenforceable. 
Consequential
Damages
Waiver
Most
drilling
contracts
contain
mutual
consequential
damages
waivers.
Regarding
these
waivers,
the 
contractor’s
main
concern
is
the
operator’s
potential
lost
production
claims.
The
waiver
benefits
the 
operator
as
well,
inasmuch
as
a
lost
hire
claim
(i.e.,
a
claim
for
the
time
in
which
revenue
is
lost
due
to 
damage
to
equipment)
from
a
rig
or
other
large
piece
of
equipment
or
tool
could
be
significant. 
There
are
two
potential
pitfalls
to
consider
when
drafting
or
negotiating
these
waivers.
First,
the
parties 
should
ensure
that
the
definition
of
consequential
damages
is
broad.
The
terms
“consequential”
and 
“indirect”
damages
are
arguably
not
specific
enough
to
guard
against
the
creative
formulations
of 
damages
that
a
lawyer
can
find
after
an
accident.
And
jurisprudence
addressing
the
meaning
of
the
term 
“consequential
damages”
leaves
significant
gray
areas.
Therefore,
the
parties
should
provide
a
definition 
in
the
contract.
They
should
draft
a
broad,
general
definition
that
expressly
includes
the
type
of
damage 
that
is
most
important
to
each
party
(“lost
production”
for
the
contractor
and
“lost
rent
or
hire”
for
the 
operator).
The
definition
should
also
include
lost
business
opportunity,
spread
costs,
and
unabsorbed 
overhead. 
Second,
the
parties
should
be
careful
about
an
“indemnity”
within
the
waiver
that
requires
the
parties
to 
indemnify
for
the
consequential
damages
claims
of
others.
A
consequential
damages
waiver
should
be 
just
that—a
waiver.
It
generally
should
not
also
be
an
indemnification
requirement.
The
problem
is
that 
the
parties
may
be
agreeing
to
an
obligation
that
they
cannot
pass
along
to
another
party—for
example, 
another
interest
owner.
A
waiver
is
different
from
an
indemnity
provision
and
may
not
include
a
defense 
obligation.
Thus,
a
party
may
be
taking
on
significant
unprotected
risk
if
it
gives
indemnification 
protection
to
the
other
party
that
it
cannot
pass
through
to
the
damaged
party. 
Similarly,
some
contract
forms
require
the
operator
to
indemnify
the
contractor
for
consequential 
damages
suffered
by
all
the
operator’s
co-owners,
co-venturers,
co-lessees,
farmors,
farmees,
partners, 
and
joint
owners.
This
is
a
potentially
dangerous
formulation.
To
give
this
broad
protection
to
the 
contractor,
the
operator
must
first
have
the
right
to
release
the
contractor
for
the
claims
brought
by
its 
co-owners
or
co-lessees.
Otherwise,
the
operator
may
find
itself
in
a
dispute
with
its
co-owners
and 
having
to
indemnify
the
contractor
for
a
claim
against
the
operator’s
own
co-owner.
An
operator
should 
either
exclude
from
the
consequential
damages
waiver
and
indemnity
provision
those
over
whom
it
does 
not
have
direct
control,
or
alternatively,
ensure
that
it
has
the
right
to
make
promises
on
behalf
of
its 
co-owners. 
Insurance
61Insurance
is
an
important
component
of
a
drilling
contract
risk
allocation
program.
Obtaining
the
proper 
insurance
helps
both
parties
in
their
status
as
either
indemnitor
or
indemnitee.
Insurance
serves
several 
purposes
in
the
drilling
contract,
including
the
following. 
•
Insurance
is
a
support
or
backstop
to
indemnity.
The
best
practice
is
to
ensure
that
insurance 
obligations
dovetail
with
the
indemnity
provisions.
Indeed,
because
of
the
potential
for
indemnity 
provisions
to
fail
(whether
due
to
improper
draftsmanship
or
anti-indemnity
statutes),
an
insurance 
provision
may
provide
more
protection
than
indemnity.
Nevertheless,
whenever
any
party
agrees 
to
provide
insurance
protection,
it
should
limit
that
protection
“to
the
extent
of
the
risks
and 
liabilities
undertaken”
by
the
indemnifying
party.
This
precaution
prevents
an
argument
that
the 
indemnified
party
has
provided
a
“free”
insurance
policy,
free
of
any
restrictions,
to
the 
indemnitee.
Moreover,
the
qualification
“to
the
extent
of
risks
and
liabilities
assumed”
helps
to 
avoid
an
argument
that
the
indemnitee
obligation
itself
must
be
enforceable
in
order
to
trigger 
insurance.
A
further
step
in
this
regard
is
to
state
that
the
insurance
obligations
are
severable
and 
not
dependent
on
the
enforceability
of
the
indemnity
provisions.
This
precaution
minimizes
the 
opportunity
for
an
unintended
consequence
in
the
event
of
an
invalid
or
unenforceable
indemnity 
obligation.
Because
an
insurance
company
will
eventually
be
the
entity
funding
an
indemnity 
obligation,
the
parties’
mutual
intent
is
thereby
achieved.
•
Insurance
protects
against
the
insolvency
of
the
indemnitor,
enhancing
the
probability
that
the 
indemnitor
will
be
able
to
meet
its
defense
and
indemnity
obligations
when
triggered
under
the 
contract.
Indeed,
most
defense
and
indemnity
obligations
are
not
satisfied
by
the
payments
out
of 
the
indemnitor’s
operating
account
but
are
provided
through
insurance.
•
Insurance
is
particularly
important
in
the
context
of
drilling
operations
because
drilling
operations 
present
unique
risks.
For
example,
the
drilling
rig
is
an
extraordinarily
expensive
piece
of 
equipment.
Drilling
operations
also
involve
a
relatively
high
risk
of
pollution
loss,
and
some
risks 
are
distinctive
to
drilling
operations,
such
as
a
loss
of
control
(blowout)
and
resultant
damage. 
Moreover,
because
drilling
operations
often
involve
complicated
geological
and
petroleum 
engineering
functions,
there
is
the
added
possibility
of
a
so-called
professional
services
loss
(e.g., 
from
a
flawed
well
plan
or
ill-advised
casing
program).
These
special
risks
cannot
be
insured
with 
the
insurance
products
typically
available
in
the
general
oil
and
gas
service
industry
market.
They 
require
specialized
policy
forms
tailored
to
the
drilling
industry.
The
“Big
Three”
Insurance
Protections
In
the
drilling
contract,
as
with
any
contract,
both
parties
should
demand
the
“big
three”
insurance 
protections:
additional
insured
status,
waiver
of
subrogation,
and
primary
status.
In
keeping
with
the 
practice
of
matching
insurance
protection
to
indemnity,
all
three
protections
(additional
insured,
waiver
of 
subrogation,
and
statement
of
primary
and
noncontributory
coverage)
should
be
extended
to
all 
indemnified
parties—for
example,
“company
group”
or
“contractor-indemnified
parties.” 
Additional
Insured
Status
Additional
insured
status
is
now
commonly
requested
in
most
oil
field
service
contracts,
including
drilling 
contracts.
Additional
insured
status
provides
several
benefits. 
•
When
properly
used,
it
allows
the
indemnitee/additional
insured
to
place
the
other
party’s 
insurance
in
front
of
the
indemnitee’s
own
policy,
thereby
protecting
the
policy
limits
of
the 
indemnitee’s
insurance
program.
•
Additional
insured
status
gives
the
party
additional
moral
authority
in
the
context
of
a
coverage 
dispute;
additional
insureds
generally
have
the
same
rights
to
defense
and
indemnity
as
the
named 
insured.
Consequently,
when
the
additional
insured
demands
coverage
and,
if
necessary,
sues
the 
insurer
for
coverage,
it
does
so
with
the
status
of
policyholder,
not
as
a
stranger
to
the
insurance 
contract.
•
Additional
insured
status
also
significantly
augments
the
total
amount
of
coverage
available
for
a
62particular
loss
or
series
of
losses.
Waiver
of
Subrogation
A
waiver
of
subrogation
provision
is
also
an
important
component
of
risk
allocation
in
drilling
contracts. 
The
drilling
contract
should
contain
a
provision
specifying
that
both
the
operator
and
the
drilling 
contractor
waive
their
rights
of
recovery
of
damages
against
each
other
(and
their
agents,
officers, 
directors,
and
employees)
to
the
extent
that
the
damages
are
covered
by
the
insurance
policies
required 
under
the
contract.
The
waiver
prevents
the
unintended
result
of
an
indemnitor’s
insurer
claiming
against 
the
indemnified
party
for
its
share
of
a
loss.
Absent
a
waiver
of
subrogation
(and
excluding
for
the 
moment
the
indemnitee’s
additional
insured
status),
an
insurance
company
that
pays
a
loss
is
ordinarily 
entitled
to
subrogate
(claim
over)
against
the
party
at
fault
to
the
extent
of
its
negligence
or
responsibility. 
An
insurance
company
generally
cannot
subrogate
against
its
own
insured,
even
an
additional
insured, 
and
thus
some
regard
the
waiver
of
subrogation
as
unnecessary.
This
position
might,
under
nearly
all 
circumstances,
be
correct. 
Not
having
a
waiver
of
subrogation
provision
in
the
contract
and
in
the
policy
is
taking
an
unnecessary 
risk.
The
subrogation
provision
in
a
standard
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy
allows
the 
insured
to
waive
rights
of
recovery
prior
to
loss,
so
that
a
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
would
not 
be
necessary
to
waive
the
insurer’s
right
of
subrogation
once
the
insured
has
waived
its
own
recovery 
rights
in
the
contract.
However,
if
either
of
the
parties
to
the
drilling
contract
has
or
might
have
a 
nonstandard
CGL
policy,
the
policy’s
subrogation
provision
might
not
allow
pre-loss
waivers
of
recovery 
rights
by
the
insured.
Any
uncertainty
on
this
important
point
can
be
avoided
with
a
waiver
of 
subrogation
endorsement
in
which
the
insurer
expressly
waives
any
rights
of
subrogation
against
the
other 
party
to
the
drilling
contract.
One
contracting
party
routinely
gives
such
protection
to
the
other
(at
least
as 
respects
risks
and
liabilities
assumed).
Furthermore,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
provides
the
suspenders
to 
the
belt
of
additional
insured
protection.
It
is
not
unheard
of
for
an
administrative
error
or 
misunderstanding
to
result
in
a
lack
of
additional
insured
protection,
even
when
required
by
contract.
The 
waiver
serves,
to
a
certain
extent,
as
a
backup
to
additional
insured
status
in
case
it
is
ineffective. 
Particularly
in
the
context
of
a
drilling
contract,
a
waiver
of
subrogation
is
prudent
because
the
magnitude 
of
the
property
risk
is
high.
Furthermore,
operators
in
particular
should
be
careful
to
seek
a
waiver
of 
subrogation,
especially
as
respects
the
contractor’s
equipment,
because
the
operator
might
not
have 
coverage
for
such
equipment.
Finally,
it
should
be
noted
that
sometimes
a
waiver
of
subrogation
provides 
more
protection
even
than
being
named
as
an
additional
insured. 
Primary
and
Noncontributory
Coverage
Each
party’s
insurance
should
be
designated
as
primary
and
noncontributory
to
any
insurance
available
to 
the
indemnified
parties.
This
type
of
provision
prevents
another
unintended
consequence:
the 
indemnitor’s
insurer
attempting
to
invoke
its
policy’s
“other
insurance
clause”
to
reduce
or
to
avoid 
coverage.
Thus,
a
statement
that
the
indemnitor’s
insurance
coverage
is
primary
for
the
risks
it
assumes 
merely
reinforces
the
parties’
intent
that
the
insurance
protection
will
match
the
indemnity
and
blunt
any 
argument
that
the
indemnitors’
insurance
was
intended
to
act
as
coinsurance,
such
that
the
indemnitor’s 
policy
requires
contribution
from
the
indemnitee’s
policy. 
Contractual
Liability
Coverage
Parties
to
a
drilling
contract
often
take
on
indirect
responsibility
for
casualties;
that
is,
they
contractually 
assume
risks
they
would
not
without
a
contract.
So-called
contractual
liability
is
often
excluded
in
a 
general
liability
policy
form.
In
fact,
most
general
liability
coverage
forms,
including
those
drafted
by
the 
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO),
initially
exclude
coverage
for
contractual
liability
and
then
provide 
some
limited
coverage
through
an
exception
to
the
exclusion
through
the
definition
of
an
“insured 
contract.”
The
provisions
work
together
to
limit
the
named
insured’s
contractual
liability
coverage
to 
those
instances
in
which
it
assumed
the
tort
liability
of
the
other
party. 
The
ISO
CGL
“Amendment
of
Insured
Contract
Definition
Endorsement”
(CG
24
26),
promulgated
in 
2003,
further
limits
the
contractual
liability
coverage
of
the
policy
it
is
attached
to
to
instances
in
which
63the
named
insured
is
at
least
partially
at
fault.
This
endorsement
exposes
the
policyholder
to
potentially 
catastrophic
uninsured
losses
if
the
indemnitee
is
proven
to
be
solely
at
fault.
The
indemnitee
under
this 
scenario
would
likewise
be
concerned,
because
insurance
is
the
most
common
form
of
ensuring
an 
indemnitor’s
ability
to
meet
its
indemnity
obligations.
As
a
result,
although
a
party
has
agreed
to 
undertake
an
indemnity
for
“all
claims
arising
under
certain
circumstances,”
its
contractual
liability 
coverage
is
not
so
broad.
In
that
case,
the
indemnifying
party
still
owes
the
obligation,
but
it
does
not 
have
the
insurance
to
fund
that
obligation.
That
sets
up
a
situation
where
the
party
is
now
relying
on
the 
indemnitor’s
solvency
to
honor
its
indemnity
obligations.
Operators
and
contractors
should
be
aware
of 
the
use
of
narrow
CGL
coverage
forms
and
endorsements
in
the
market
and
take
steps
to
avoid
their 
effects. 
Each
party
should
ensure
that
its
own
obligations
are
correctly
insured.
As
an
initial
matter,
the
mere
fact 
that
the
coverage
is
found
within
an
exception
to
an
exclusion
could
make
some
oil
and
gas 
operators/contractors
somewhat
uneasy.
Indeed,
the
definition
of
“insured
contract”
arguably
does
not 
capture
all
of
the
potential
contractually
assumed
liabilities
a
party
may
have
in
a
typical
drilling
or 
service
contract.
For
example,
under
“sound
location”
provisions
in
drilling
contracts,
the
operator
is 
asked
to
assume
liability
for
the
rig
even
in
the
absence
of
the
operator’s
fault
or
tort
liability.
Therefore, 
under
sound
location
provisions,
when
the
operator
agrees
to
accept
liability
for
the
driller’s
own 
equipment,
even
if
it
is
damaged
by
the
sole
fault
of
the
driller,
it
could
be
argued
that
the
operator
is
not 
thereby
taking
on
the
“tort
liability
of
another”—the
driller
cannot
have
tort
liability
for
damaging
its
own 
equipment.
An
insurer,
however,
may
argue
that
there
is
no
coverage
for
any
contractual
liability
for 
damage
to
the
other
party’s
property
where
that
liability
is
assumed
without
regard
to
fault.
The
insurer 
argues
that,
because
the
other
party/indemnitee
has
no
tort
liability
for
damage
to
its
own
property
and 
because
there
is
coverage
only
for
the
named
insured’s
assumption
of
tort
liability,
there
is
no
contractual 
liability
coverage
for
the
promise
to
indemnify
another
party
for
loss
to
its
own
equipment
due
to
its
own 
fault.
And,
as
discussed
above,
indemnity
without
regard
to
fault
is
typical
in
drilling
contracts. 
Relatedly,
the
contract
should
specify
that
each
party
is
to
obtain
contractual
liability
coverage
that
is 
broad
enough
to
fund
all
of
the
liabilities
undertaken
within
the
indemnity
provisions
of
the
contract.
This 
provision
helps
awaken
the
conscience
of
both
parties
and
causes
them
to
verify
that
they
have 
contractual
liability
coverage
that
is
broad
enough
to
actually
fund
their
obligations.
Here
is
an
example 
provision: 
 
The
indemnifying
party’s
contractual
liability
coverage
must
provide
coverage
for
all
of
the 
release,
defense,
indemnity,
and
hold
harmless
obligations
undertaken
by
that
party
in
Section
[_] 
of
this
Contract. 
Such
a
provision
will
alert
the
indemnifying
party
that
it
might
not
have
contractual
liability
coverage
in 
its
own
liability
policy.
Furthermore,
it
can
blunt
an
argument
by
that
indemnifying
party
that
it 
technically
complied
with
contractual
liability
requirements,
even
though
the
coverage
that
it
actually 
obtained
was
so
narrow
as
to
be
illusory.
The
existence
of
general
liability
coverage
forms
that
provide 
restricted
contractual
liability
coverage
serves
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
so-called
Dickerson 
provision,
which
confirms
that
a
party’s
indemnity
obligations
are
not
limited
by
insurance:
“Contractor’s 
indemnity
obligations
shall
be
supported,
but
not
limited
by,
liability
insurance
with
minimum
limits
as 
indicated
in
Exhibit
‘A.’”
As
with
the
base
of
the
contract
itself,
the
insurance
requirements
should 
specify
that
minimum
limits
are
not
a
limitation
or
restriction
on
indemnity. 
The
best
practice
is
to
obtain
a
specific
contractual
liability
endorsement
(or
at
least
a
specialized
oil
and 
gas
insurance
form)
that
is
crystal
clear
that
whatever
liability
that
it
traditionally
undertakes
in
a
drilling 
contract
is
covered
under
the
contractual
liability
provision.
The
contractual
liability
endorsement
should 
provide
broad
and
unambiguous
coverage
for
the
contractual
obligations
that
the
party
typically
assumes 
in
a
drilling
contract,
such
as
the
operator’s
potential
liability
for
damage
to
the
rig,
certain
pollution 
liabilities,
down-hole
tools,
etc.
Thus,
instead
of
relying
on
the
basic
language
provided
in
an
ISO
form, 
with
its
potential
pitfalls,
the
most
prudent
step
to
take
is
to
seek
a
manuscript
endorsement
that
squarely 
covers
such
typical
liabilities.
One
possible
sample
manuscript
contractual
liability
endorsement
is
shown 
in
Exhibit
5.7.
Whether
an
insurer
will
provide
such
a
manuscript
contractual
liability
endorsement
will 
vary,
depending
on
such
things
as
account
size
and
insurance
market
conditions.

Insurance
Issues
Specific
to
Drilling
Operations
Inconsistencies
between
indemnity
obligations
and
insurance
coverage
and
the
need
for
comprehensive 
insurance
protection
create
huge
problems
in
the
context
of
a
drilling
contract.
These
operations
present 
enormous
risks
of
loss
from
third-party
liability,
first-party
property
losses,
and
loss
of
income.
Operating 
without
the
proper
insurance
can
place
an
enterprise’s
very
existence
at
risk. 
Some
of
the
major
risks
involve
loss
of
the
drilling
unit,
debris
and
wreck
removal,
and
loss
of
the
hole. 
Loss
of
the
Drilling
Unit
The
drilling
rig
and
its
appurtenances
are
very
expensive
pieces
of
equipment.
Some
drilling
contract 
forms,
like
the
IADC,
attempt
to
shift
risk
of
loss
to
the
drilling
rig
and/or
other
parts
of
the
drilling
unit 
(i.e.,
drill
string
and
other
in-hole
equipment)
to
the
operator
in
certain
circumstances.
In
most
cases,
such 
liability
would
be
excluded
in
the
operator’s
general
liability
policy;
so
the
operator’s
only
insurance 
coverage,
if
any,
may
be
found
in
its
OEE/COW
policy.
If
present,
that
coverage
is
found
in
the
“care, 
custody,
and
control”
endorsement
to
the
OEE/COW
policy.
And
the
coverage
often
comes
with 
unsatisfactory
limitations:
coverage
is
often
limited
to
$250,000
or
$500,000,
and
some
forms
only
cover 
the
drilling
unit
while
it
is
on
location
or
if
the
loss
is
due
to
cratering
or
blowout.
Of
course,
those 
limitations
leave
the
operator
with
significant
uninsured
exposure. 
Unmodified,
paragraph
10
(“Sound
Location”)
in
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract
presents
a
potential 
gap
between
indemnity
obligations
and
the
OEE/COW
insurance
coverage
that
most
operators
carry.
The 
standard
sound
location
provision
shifts
liability
for
damage
to
the
drilling
rig
while
moving
onto
the 
location
or
at
the
drill
site
to
the
operator
without
regard
to
fault
(in
contravention
of
the
standard 
knock-for-knock
arrangement).
Thus,
if
the
rig
is
damaged
by
an
unsound
location
due
to
the
drilling 
contractor’s
sole
fault,
the
operator
will
be
responsible
for
the
damage.
The
operator,
however,
might 
have
no
insurance
coverage
for
this
contractually
assumed
liability.
Most
operators
are
unwilling
(perhaps 
unable)
to
assume
that
risk.
Therefore,
operators
should
obtain
additional
insurance
coverage
or
modify 
the
drilling
contract
to
manage
their
exposure.
One
way
to
accomplish
this
is
to
negotiate,
in
the
drilling 
contract,
a
monetary
limit
on
the
operator’s
exposure
that
equates
to
the
operator’s
OEE/COW
insurance 
coverage. 
Debris
and
Wreck
Removal
The
IADC
form
shifts
liability
for
debris
and
wreck
removal
to
the
operator
in
the
event
of
an
unsound 
location
(paragraph
10)
or
well
control
event
(section
14.10).
Some
OEE/COW
insurance
policies, 
however,
do
not
provide
broad
coverage
for
third-party
wreck
removal. 
For
example,
some
OEE
forms
limit
wreck
removal
coverage
to
first-party
property.
This
is
problematic 
because
coverage
for
removal
of
third-party
property
is
essential
for
risks
allocated
pursuant
to
the 
drilling
contracts.
Also,
removal
of
first-party
property
may
be
covered
by
the
operator’s
property
policy 
anyway.
Fortunately,
even
if
the
wreck
removal
endorsement
to
the
operator’s
OEE/COW
policy
only 
covers
first-party
property,
the
operator
will
likely
have
some
coverage
for
third-party
wreck
removal 
under
COW
coverage.
Unfortunately,
wreck
removal
under
COW
coverage
will
only
pay
to
move
the 
wreckage
away
from
the
wellhead
in
order
to
control
the
well;
it
might
not
pay
to
take
the
wreckage 
off-site.
Therefore,
this
protection
is
not
as
beneficial
as
a
broad
wreck
removal
endorsement
with
ample 
limits,
but
it
is
useful
when
the
wreck
removal
endorsement
is
narrow
or
contains
a
low
sublimit. 
Therefore,
in
the
drilling
contracts,
operators
should
try
to
limit
their
obligations
to
pay
for
third-party 
wreck
removal
to
the
extent
necessary
to
bring
the
well
under
control.
That
way,
the
operator
helps
ensure
65that
(regardless
of
its
policy
form)
it
will
likely
have
at
least
some
degree
of
insurance
protection
for
its 
wreck
removal
obligations. 
Another
way
to
ensure
broader
coverage
for
wreck
removal
is
to
negotiate
with
the
insurer
for
wreck 
removal
protection
under
the
“care,
custody,
or
control”
endorsement
of
the
OEE/COW
form,
which 
could
potentially
have
higher
limits
than
the
wreck
removal
endorsement.
Of
course,
insurance
coverage 
often
varies
depending
on
the
specific
policy,
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
wreck
removal
coverage. 
Coverage
limits
for
wreck
removal
in
an
OEE/COW
policy
may
be
subject
to
the
policy’s
combined 
single
limit,
a
sublimit
under
the
combined
single
limit,
or
an
additional
limit
separate
from
the
combined 
single
limit.
In
any
case,
coverage
under
the
care,
custody,
or
control
endorsement
could
provide 
additional
or
possibly
greater
protection. 
Although
the
unmodified
IADC
form
again
presents
significant
uninsured
exposure
to
the
operator,
the 
operator
can
mitigate
this
risk
by
obtaining
more
insurance
or
by
negotiating
in
the
drilling
contract
limits 
on
its
liability
that
align
with
its
insurance
coverage. 
Loss
of
the
Hole
Under
section
14.5
of
the
2003
IADC
Daywork
Contract,
the
operator
assumes
responsibility
for
loss
of 
the
hole
under
all
circumstances.
Most
OEE
policies,
however,
only
cover
the
cost
of
redrill
if
caused
by 
a
wild
well
incident
or
by
fire.
Operators
may
obtain
“extended
redrill”
coverage
to
cover
other
perils, 
but,
in
any
event,
none
of
the
standard
forms
on
the
market
(even
for
extended
redrill
coverage)
are
“all 
risk”
coverages.
In
other
words,
only
loss
from
specified
perils
will
be
covered.
Therefore,
absent
a 
manuscript
redrill
endorsement,
the
operator
may
not
be
able
to
insure
loss
of
the
hole
under
all
of
the 
circumstances
for
which
it
assumes
responsibility
under
the
drilling
contract. 
Moreover,
negotiating
carve-outs
or
limits
to
the
operator’s
responsibility
for
loss
of
the
hole
is
difficult 
and
unlikely.
Some
contractors,
however,
are
willing
to
perform
redrill
operations
at
a
discounted
rate 
(e.g.,
65
percent
of
their
standard
cost)
if
the
loss
of
the
hole
is
caused
by
their
sole
or
gross
fault.
This 
compromise
does
help
to
mitigate
the
operators’
uninsurable
exposure
for
loss
of
the
hole. 
Lost
Business
Income
Under
a
typical
waiver
of
consequential
damages,
each
party
will
likely
bear
its
own
risk
of
lost
income: 
for
the
contractor,
its
lost
day
rate
for
a
damaged
or
destroyed
rig;
and,
for
the
operator,
its
lost
or 
deferred
production
income.
These
waivers
typically
apply
regardless
of
fault.
These
types
of
losses
can 
be
crippling.
Management
may
find
it
hard
to
swallow
that,
when
another
party
destroys
a
huge
revenue 
stream
due
to
its
own
negligence
(either
the
operator
that
destroys
the
contractor’s
rig
or
the
contractor 
that
destroys
the
operator’s
reservoir),
the
negligent
party
is
not
responsible
for
the
innocent
parties’
lost 
revenue.
That,
however,
is
the
reality
in
the
industry.
Insurance
is
a
useful
tool
to
fill
in
some
of
that
gap. 
For
drilling
contractors,
this
protection
would
generally
come
in
the
form
of
traditional
business
income 
coverages,
summarized
as
follows. 
•
Business
income
coverage:
coverage
applies
to
loss
of
income
resulting
from
suspension
of 
operations
due
to
physical
damage
by
a
covered
cause
of
loss
to
covered
property.
•
Contingent/Dependent
property
business
income
coverage:
coverage
applies
to
loss
of
income 
suffered
as
a
result
of
damage
from
a
covered
cause
of
loss
to
property
of
others
on
which
the 
insured’s
operations
rely.
•
Ingress/Egress
coverage:
coverage
applies
to
income
loss
when
the
insured’s
operations
are 
suspended
because
of
inability
to
access
covered
property
as
a
result
of
a
covered
cause
of
loss.
•
Civil
authority
coverage:
coverage
applies
to
income
loss
suffered
when
government
action 
suspends
the
insured’s
operations
or
prevents
access
to
its
facilities
as
a
result
of
a
covered
cause 
of
loss.
For
operators’
lost
or
deferred
production
income,
however,
the
insurance
protection
is
more
specialized 
to
the
oil
and
gas
industry.
The
insurance
industry
offers
“loss
of
production
income”
coverage
to
oil
and
66gas
exploration
companies.
This
is
a
specialized
product
that
often
provides
coverage
on
a
“valued
basis.” 
This
means
that
value
of
the
lost
or
deferred
production
is
determined
by
a
formula
at
the
time
the 
coverage
is
purchased.
Once
the
coverage
is
triggered
and
the
time
frame
of
the
loss
or
deferral
is 
established,
valuation
of
damages
is
calculated
based
on
the
value
established
on
the
front
end. 
Insurance
Certificates
A
final
insurance
protection
is
obtaining
insurance
certificates
from
the
other
party
to
verify
that
its 
coverage
is
appropriate
and
complies
with
the
requirements
under
the
contract.
At
a
minimum,
the 
certificate
should
reflect
that
the
basic
insurance
protections
(additional
insured,
waiver
of
subrogation, 
statement
of
primary
coverage)
are
in
place.
This
information
can
be
provided
in
the
certificate’s
“notes” 
section. 
However,
it
is
not
appropriate
to
rely
on
certificates
of
insurance
to
ensure
the
other
party’s
compliance. 
Most
insurance
certificates
provide
very
limited
information:
the
type
of
coverage
(general
liability, 
commercial
property,
etc.),
policy
limits,
dates,
the
name
of
the
insurers,
and
the
identity
of
the
named 
additional
insured.
Clerical
personnel
often
produce
the
certificates
without
much
oversight
by
the
agent 
or
broker.
Depending
on
the
insurance
agent’s
practices,
the
certificate
may
also
include
some
limited 
information
as
to
additional
insured
status
and
waivers
of
subrogation,
but
certificates
rarely
provide 
important
information
regarding
exclusions,
endorsements,
or
the
scope
of
additional
insured
protection. 
Moreover,
the
disclaimer
language
found
on
most
insurance
certificates
is
problematic,
inasmuch
as
the 
courts
have
held
that
the
certificate
holder
has
no
right
to
rely
on
the
representations
made
in
the 
certificate. 
Asking
for
a
custom-made
certificate
is
possible
but
not
always
practical.
Consequently,
parties
to
a 
drilling
contract
should
take
the
initiative
and
ask
for
specifics
or
significant
modifications
to
the 
insurance
certificate.
If
the
agent
or
broker
is
unwilling
to
cooperate,
then
a
prudent
party
to
a
drilling 
contract
should
ask
to
see
the
other
party’s
policy
or
a
synopsis
of
it
or
ask
specific
questions
regarding 
exclusions
and
endorsements.
One
good
practice
is
to
contractually
reserve
the
right
to
require 
adjustments
to
the
certificate
from
the
other
party
if
a
review
shows
potential
problems
or
omissions.
This 
is
particularly
important
in
the
context
of
a
drilling
contract,
where
there
are
special
risks
not
encountered 
in
the
run-of-the-mill
surface
contract.
A
sample
provision
could
look
like
this: 
 
Operator
shall
provide
an
insurance
certificate
on
a
form
satisfactory
to
Contractor,
evidencing 
the
above
coverages
are
in
place. 
An
insurance
certificate
generally
does
not
bind
the
insurer.
But
where
there
is
a
close
question
on
a 
coverage
issue,
a
court
may
consider
extrinsic
evidence
to
determine
the
insurance
policy’s
intent. 
Moreover,
a
complete
insurance
certificate
may
provide
some
leverage
needed
to
win
a
coverage
dispute 
or
at
least
to
provide
a
basis
of
a
detrimental
reliance/estoppel
argument.

Master
Service
Agreements
The
master
service
agreement
(MSA)
is
a
contract
that
establishes
liabilities
and
indemnification
between 
the
operator
and
each
well
service
contractor.
Oil
field
operations
involve
multiple
employers,
many 
workers,
and
expensive
property,
often
at
a
common
work
site.
Oil
and
gas
operations
can
be
dangerous, 
and
the
risks
to
property
and
personnel
are
sizable.
Accordingly,
a
comprehensive
system
of
risk 
allocation—one
that
works
cohesively
on
an
enterprise-wide
basis—is
essential
to
mitigate
the
effects
of 
casualties,
to
foster
certainty
in
the
case
of
an
accident,
and
to
reduce
litigation
costs.
But
creating
and 
maintaining
a
unified
risk
allocation
program
is
difficult.
An
MSA
is
a
useful
tool
to
help
that
system 
work
properly. 
MSAs
often
use
the
term
“Operator
Group”
to
refer
to
the
operator
and
its
affiliates,
partners,
owners, 
agents,
contractors,
and
subcontractors;
likewise,
they
use
the
term
“Contractor
Group”
to
refer
to
the 
contractor
with
whom
the
operator
is
contracting,
plus
its
affiliates,
partners,
owners,
agents,
contractors, 
and
subcontractors.
MSAs
enable
operators
and
contractors
to
meet
the
fast-paced
operational
demands 
and
complex
risk
allocation
demands
of
the
oil
field
confidently
and
efficiently.
Used
properly,
they 
create
cohesive
risk
allocation
programs
that
bring
a
certain
degree
of
certainty
to
often
dangerous 
endeavors.
However,
MSAs
are
not
suited
to
every
situation.
They
are
best
suited
for
recurring
or 
ongoing
work
that
involves
a
common
workplace.
And
when
they
are
used,
they
must
be
part
of
a 
consistent
program
that
takes
into
account
other
MSAs,
drilling
contracts,
fracking
contracts,
other 
specialty
contracts,
the
parties’
insurance
programs,
and
applicable
law.
Without
an
organized
approach 
that
integrates
risk
allocation
concepts
into
an
enterprise-wide
program,
even
a
brilliantly
drafted
MSA 
can
create
unacceptable
and
unintended
risk. 
This
chapter
explores
risk
allocation
matters
within
MSAs
and
how
MSAs
interplay
with
one
another, 
other
types
of
contracts,
and
insurance
coverage.
Some
of
the
issues
discussed
here
have
previously
been 
discussed
in
the
context
of
other
contracts.
This
chapter’s
discussion
focuses
on
their
application
to 
MSAs. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
1.

an
MSA’s
basic
functions,

the
fundamental
risk
allocation
principles
generally
used
in
the
oil
field,

the
implications
of
an
MSA’s
risk
allocation
provisions,
4.
recognize
potential
clashes
between
risk
allocation
provisions
in
an
MSA
and
risk
allocation
or 
indemnity
provisions
in
other
contracts,

recognize
the
importance
of
“magic
language”
in
drafting
indemnity
provisions,
6.

between
“indemnify”
and
“release,”
and
7.
identify
the
“big
three”
types
of
insurance
protections
and
recognize
the
importance
of
each.
Basic
Functions
of
an
MSA
MSAs
establish
a
contractual
relationship
that
can
govern
ongoing
or
reoccurring
work
during 
exploration,
drilling,
and
production
without
renegotiating
general
terms
and
conditions
over
and
over
68again.
This
is
important
in
the
oil
field,
where
operations
can
move
fast—much
faster
than
lawyers
can 
negotiate
contracts.
The
MSA
establishes
the
governing
framework
under
which
the
parties
will
operate
if 
they
enter
into
an
agreement
for
particular
work
in
the
future. 
Once
an
MSA
is
in
place
with
a
service
contractor,
the
operator
can
“call
out”
(assign
a
certain
work 
project
to)
that
contractor
for
specific
work
under
a
purchase
or
work
order.
The
work
order
will
usually 
contain
specifics
about
the
nature
of
the
work—specifications,
time
frame,
equipment,
workforce,
and 
cost—whereas
the
general
terms
and
conditions
(e.g.,
risk
allocation,
standard
of
performance, 
termination,
etc.)
have
already
been
negotiated
in
the
MSA. 
Parties
benefit
from
having
risk
allocation
provisions
established
in
advance
of
an
actual
work
order.
The 
need
to
have
a
predetermined
risk
allocation
structure
is
magnified
when
the
operations
involve
multiple 
employers
at
a
common
work
site. 
Risk
Allocation
in
the
Oil
Field
Risk
Allocation
Based
on
Fault
Allocating
fault
for
accidents
at
multiemployer
work
sites
can
be
complex
and
costly.
It
is
rare
that
an
oil 
field
accident
can
fairly
be
attributed
solely
to
the
failure
of
a
single
individual
or
company
to
follow 
good
practices,
to
be
attentive,
or
to
comply
with
regulations. 
When
a
casualty
results
from
an
unfortunate
confluence
of
errors
committed
by
multiple
people
and/or 
multiple
companies,
it
is
often
difficult
to
figure
out
each
party’s
percentage
of
the
blame.
That
difficulty 
can
give
rise
to
lengthy
and
expensive
litigation,
which
ties
up
personnel
and
resources,
fosters 
uncertainty
in
budgeting
and
risk
management,
and
sours
business
relationships.
In
bodily
injury 
litigation,
sometimes
the
plaintiffs’
lawyers
gleefully
allow
two
oil
field
companies
to
marshal
negative 
evidence
about
each
other,
raising
the
value
of
the
injured
person’s
lawsuit
to
the
detriment
of
both 
defendant
companies. 
Risk
Allocation
Based
on
Ownership
To
avoid
the
problems
associated
with
fault-based
risk
allocation,
the
parties
often
agree
to
allocate
risk 
based
on
ownership
of
personnel
and
property—not
on
fault.
Allocating
risk
based
on
ownership
rather 
than
fault
makes
post-casualty
finger-pointing
unnecessary.
The
parties
can
reduce
litigation
expenses
and 
introduce
at
least
a
moderate
level
of
certainty
about
the
possible
risks
of
their
operations.
Moreover,
if
a 
party
knows
that
it
will
be
responsible
for
its
own
personnel
and
property
(e.g.,
three
workers
and
$4 
million
worth
of
equipment)
regardless
of
fault,
it
can
better
assess
the
extent
of
its
exposure. 
An
MSA
with
the
ownership-based
risk
allocation
structure
discussed
here
is
not
always
appropriate
for 
work
that
does
not
involve
multiple
employers
at
a
common
work
site.
When
one
employer
controls
the 
entire
work
site
and
workforce,
allocating
fault
is
less
difficult,
and
the
benefits
of
allocating
risk
without 
regard
to
fault
are
reduced.
In
fact,
without
a
common
workplace,
the
underlying
assumptions
that
dictate 
the
use
of
ownership-based
risk
allocation
generally
do
not
exist. 
Setting
the
Basic
Indemnity
Framework
The
decision
to
allocate
risk
on
an
ownership
basis
should
be
an
all-or-nothing
proposition,
with
as
few 
exceptions
as
possible.
This
applies
not
only
to
the
general
decision
to
allocate
risk
based
on
ownership 
rather
than
fault
but
also
to
the
scope
of
that
indemnification
arrangement.
Therefore,
the
fundamental 
question
for
contracting
parties
is
to
determine
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
risk
allocation
program
that 
will
apply
at
common
work
sites.
Exhibit
6.1
lists
and
describes
the
three
types
of
ownership-based 
indemnity
arrangements
commonly
used
in
energy
contracts. 
69Exhibit
6.1
 
Examples
of
Ownership-Based
Oil
Field
Indemnity
Arrangements
•
Broad
reciprocal
indemnity:
Each
indemnifies
the
other
party—and
the
other
party’s 
contractors
and
subcontractors—from
claims
arising
out
of
injury,
illness,
death,
and 
loss/damage
to
property
of
its
own
employees
and
property
of
its
own
contractors’
and 
subcontractors’
employees
and
property.
•
Narrow
reciprocal
indemnity:
Each
party
indemnifies
the
other
party—but
not
the
other 
party’s
contractors
and
subcontractors—from
claims
arising
out
of
injury,
illness,
death,
and 
loss/damage
to
property
of
its
own
employees
and
property
but
not
of
its
contractors’
and 
subcontractors’
employees
and
property.
The
protection
extends
only
to
the
indemnitee
and 
not
to
its
contractors
and
subcontractors.
•
Modified
reciprocal
indemnity:
This
hybrid
approach
could
include
a
number
of
varieties.
In 
one
variety,
the
indemnitor
indemnifies
only
for
loss
to
its
own
people
and
property—but 
extends
that
protection
to
the
other
parties’
contractors
and
subcontractors
as
well.
There
are 
numerous
varieties
of
this
approach.
A
party
should
not
employ
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity
in
some
of
its
MSAs
and
a
narrow
reciprocal 
indemnity
in
others.
Here’s
why.
Imagine
an
operator
that
has
two
MSAs.
One
is
with
a
crane
provider 
and
contains
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity
provision.
The
other
is
with
a
tool
supplier
and
contains
a 
narrow
reciprocal
indemnity
provision.
If
the
crane
provider
negligently
destroys
the
tool
supplier’s 
equipment,
the
operator
would
ultimately
be
responsible
for
that
loss—even
though
it
neither
caused
the 
loss
nor
owned
the
property—because
of
the
broad
reciprocal
indemnity
provision
in
the
MSA
with
the 
crane
provider.
If
the
tool
supplier
were
to
sue
the
crane
provider,
the
crane
provider
could
properly 
tender
the
suit
to
the
operator.
The
operator
would
have
no
recourse
against
the
tool
supplier
because
its 
MSA
with
the
tool
supplier
contains
a
narrow
reciprocal
indemnity.
That
is
the
worst
of
both
worlds
for 
the
operator. 
Foreman

A
Case
Study

the
Need

Allocation 
Structure

in
Foreman
v.
Exxon

770
F.2d

(5th

provides
a
good
case
study
on
the
fundamental
importance
of
maintaining
a
cohesive
risk 
allocation
program
throughout
the
entire
enterprise.
Foreman
was
a

case.
The

among
Exxon,

company,
and
a
casing
company
(the
injured
party’s 
employer)
as
follows. 
•
Fifty-five
percent
to
the
drilling
company
•
Ten
percent
to
Exxon
•
Thirty-five
percent
to
the
casing
company
Exxon
sought
indemnity
from
the
casing
company
for
its
10
percent
of
the
fault
pursuant
to
its
contract 
with
the
casing
company.
Exxon
also
had
an
indemnity
agreement
with
the
drilling
company—which 
required
Exxon
to
pay
the
drilling
company’s
apportioned
fault
of
55
percent.
Exxon
also
sought 
indemnity
from
the
casing
company
for
this
55
percent
contractual
liability. 
But
the
court
found
that
the
language
of
the
contract
between
Exxon
and
the
casing
company
did
not 
permit
recovery
of
Exxon’s
contractual
indemnity
because
the
indemnity
provision
was
limited
to
claims 
arising
on
account
of
bodily
injury.
For
the
contract
with
the
casing
company
to
include
indemnification 
for
third-party
liabilities
Exxon
incurred
through
separate
contracts,
Exxon
would
have
to
have
expressed 
this
more
clearly:
“We
conclude
that
[the
casing
company’s]
obligation
to
indemnify
Exxon
for
Exxon’s 
contractual
liability
to
[the
drilling
company]
may
arise
only
from
the
plainly
expressed
intention
of
the 
parties,
spelled
out
in
unambiguous
terms.”
Accordingly,
Exxon
(although
only
10
percent
at
fault
itself) 
was
responsible
for
55
percent
of
the
claim. 
The
lesson
here
is
that
a
party’s
obligation
to
indemnify
the
other
does
not
include
the
indemnitee’s
70contractually
assumed
liability.
The
unexpected
liability
that
results
from
forgetting
that
lesson
can
be 
called
“the
Foreman
problem.” 
Pass-Through
Indemnification:
The
Solution
to
the
Foreman
Problem
The
solution
to
the
Foreman
problem
is
to
make
sure
any
MSA
program
that
includes
broad
reciprocal 
indemnity
provisions
also
contains
pass-through
indemnity
provisions
in
all
MSAs
(and
other
types
of 
contracts).
For
an
indemnity
provision
to
cover
the
indemnitee’s
contractual
liability
to
third
parties,
the 
parties
must
clearly
express
that
in
the
agreement.
Failing
to
include
a
pass-through
in
even
one
contract 
could
create
a
significant
unanticipated
exposure. 
There
are
several
ways
to
create
a
pass-through.
A
common
and
effective
approach
is
to
create
defined 
categories
of
entities
and
individuals
to
whom
indemnity
protections
flow
under
the
MSA.
By
broadening 
the
universe
of
indemnitees
to
include
the
contracting
parties’
affiliates,
partners,
owners,
agents, 
contractors,
and
subcontractors—often
defined
as
the
“Operator
Group”
and
the
“Contractor
Group”—the 
parties
simply
and
effectively
create
pass-through
protection
for
those
indemnitees.
This
approach
also 
reduces
the
risk
of
inconsistency
within
the
MSA,
particularly
regarding
coordination
of
the
indemnity 
arrangement
with
the
insurance
plan
(discussed
in
more
detail
later). 
Trendsetters:
Drillers,
Fracking
Companies,
and
Large
Service
Contractors
For
a
drilling
operation,
the
driller
often
employs
the
most
laborers
and
brings
the
most
expensive
piece 
of
equipment
onto
the
work
site.
The
primary
piece
of
equipment
is
the
drilling
unit
itself.
Similarly,
for 
fracking
operations,
the
fracking
company
usually
brings
the
most
expensive
equipment
and
largest 
number
of
employees
to
the
work
site.
Therefore,
although
drilling
and
fracking
contracts
are
not 
typically
governed
by
master
agreements,
the
MSA
program
must
contemplate
and
fit
together
with
the 
risk
allocation
provisions
in
those
contracts. 
A
disconnect
between
the
drilling
or
fracking
contract
and
an
MSA
potentially
creates
a
large
gap
in 
protection
for
the
operator.
For
example,
if
an
MSA
requires
the
operator
to
indemnify
the
fracking 
contractor
for
claims
by
a
broad
Operator
Group,
but
the
fracking
contract
does
not
release
a
broad 
Operator
Group
from
damage
to
the
frack
fleet,
the
operator
may
be
responsible
for
a
lost
frack
fleet.
In 
other
words,
the
operator
would
have
a
Foreman
problem—not
having
a
proper
“pass-through”—and
the 
exposure
would
be
the
entire
frack
fleet. 
Several
large
service
providers
offer
numerous
services
through
the
oil
and
gas
industry
and
throughout 
the
country.
If
an
operator
depends
on
getting
certain
services
from
a
particular
service
provider,
the
risk 
allocation
arrangement
in
the
MSA
with
that
service
provider
can
shape
the
risk
structure
in
the
operator’s 
entire
MSA
program. 
Carve-Outs:
Exceptions
to
the
Overarching
Indemnity
Framework
Although
the
general
plan
is
to
allocate
risk
based
on
ownership,
parties
increasingly
seek
and
agree
to 
carve-outs
from
that
general
framework.
These
exceptions
can
be
significant.
Like
all
risk
allocation 
features,
they
must
be
analyzed,
not
in
isolation
but
in
the
context
of
the
entire
risk
program
for
the 
common
work
site. 
Carve-Outs
for
Contractors’
Down-Hole
Equipment
One
common
carve-out
is
the
contractor’s
down-hole
equipment.
The
contractor’s
justification
for 
carving
out
down-hole
tools
from
the
ownership
model
is
generally
that
well
conditions
are
unknown
and 
beyond
the
contractor’s
control. 
Operators
typically
accept
the
carve-out
for
down-hole
tools
as
standard
in
the
industry.
Other
proposed 
carve-outs,
however,
often
meet
greater
resistance
(e.g.,
equipment
in
transit
by
operator-provided 
transportation,
any
equipment
not
in
the
contractor’s
control,
or
materials
that
the
contractor
provides
at 
the
operator’s
request
beyond
the
scope
of
work). 
Even
for
carve-outs
that
are
generally
accepted
as
industry
standards
(like
the
down-hole
tool
carve-out), 
one
should
pay
close
attention
to
the
basis
of
the
carve-out.
For
example,
consider
the
difference
between
71the
two
down-hole
tool
indemnity
provisions
shown
in
Exhibit
6.2. 
72Exhibit

be

for
and
shall
release,
protect,
defend,
indemnify,
and
hold
harmless 
Contractor
Group
from
and
against
any
and
all
loss
of
or
damage
to
Contractor
Group’s
down-hole 
tools
REGARDLESS
OF
FAULT.
Sample

(assigns
operator
the
responsibility
for
Contractor
Group’s
tools
lost
or
damaged 
in
the

Operator
shall
be
responsible
for
and
shall
release,
protect,
defend,
indemnify,
and
hold
harmless 
Contractor
Group
from
and
against
any
and
all
loss
of
or
damage
to
Contractor
Group’s
tools
that 
are
lost
or
damaged
in
the
hole
REGARDLESS
OF
FAULT.
Do
the
parties
intend
for
down-hole
tools
to
be
the
operator’s
responsibility
even
if
they
are
destroyed
on 
the
deck
of
the
drilling
rig?
Probably
not.
The
language
shown
in
Sample
2
likely
accomplishes
the 
parties’
intent
more
accurately
than
the
language
shown
in
Sample
1. 
Special
Events
Clauses:
The
Ultimate
Carve-Out
The
so-called
special
events
clause
(sometimes
called
a
“catastrophic
loss”
clause)
is
particularly 
controversial.
The
friction
between
contractors
and
operators
appears
to
center
around
the
nature
of
the 
clause:
whether
it
is
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
general
indemnity
arrangement
under
certain 
circumstances,
strictly
an
allocation
of
extra
expenses
from
particular
types
of
events,
or
some
amalgam 
of
those
two. 
Exhibit
6.3
shows
two
examples
of
a
special
events
indemnity
provision.
The
language
shown
in
Sample 
1
is
an
example
of
a
particularly
aggressive
“special
events”
indemnity
clause,
which
could
be
read
to
be 
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
general
indemnity
arrangement.
Under
this
language,
contractors
could
argue 
that
the
entire
general
indemnity
arrangement
is
inapplicable
in
the
event
of
a
fire
or
blowout
and
that
the 
operator
is
responsible
for
everyone’s
losses
(bodily
injuries,
deaths,
and
property
damages).
An 
aggressive
interpretation
or
application
of
the
“arising
out
of
or
in
connection
with”
language
could
result 
in
what
is
perhaps
an
unintended
result.

[Emphasis
added]
Sample
2
(modification
of
Sample
1):
Notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
MSA,
Operator
shall
release,
protect,
defend,
indemnify 
and
hold
harmless
Contractor
Group
from
and
against
any
and
all
Claims
costs
or
expenses 
incurred
by
any
member
of
Company
Group,
Contractor
Group,
or
any
other
person
or
entity
arising 
out
of
or
in
connection
with
for
controlling
and/or
cleaning
up
any
uncontrolled
well
conditions,
fire, 
cratering,
explosion,
wild
well
or
blowout,
pollution
and/or
radiation
contamination.
Operators
typically
accept
that,
in
the
event
of
a
blowout,
their
operators
extra
expense/control
of
well 
(OEE/COW)
insurance
will
respond
to
bring
the
well
under
control,
put
out
fires,
and
redrill
the
well
if 
necessary.
But
operators
do
not
expect
to
be
responsible
for
all
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
claims 
that
“arise
out
of
or
in
connection
with”
that
blowout
and
fire.
In
fact,
the
operator
might
not
be
able
to 
obtain
insurance
for
that
broad
swath
of
responsibility.
Therefore,
an
operator
might
want
to
seek
to 
modify
the
above
language
as
shown
in
Sample
2. 
The
language
in
Sample
2
places
the
extra
expenses
and
costs
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
specified
“special 
events”
on
the
operator.
But
it
does
not
override
the
general
indemnity
arrangement
for
bodily
injury, 
death,
and
property
damage
claims.
This
arrangement
takes
into
consideration
the
parties’
respective 
insurance
programs.
The
contractor,
which
likely
cannot
practically
obtain
insurance
protection
for
well 
control
costs,
has
no
responsibility
for
those
types
of
expenses.
And
the
operator,
which
typically
does
not 
have
insurance
for
contractors’
property
that
is
not
within
its
control,
similarly
is
not
responsible
for
those 
damages. 
An
additional
protection
for
ensuring
that
the
carve-outs
are
narrowly
tailored
to
a
particular
category
and 
situation
is
adding
a
provision
at
the
end
of
the
carve-out
to
make
this
clear.
Sample
language
for
this 
clarification
of
the
carve-out
language
is
shown
in
Exhibit
6.4.
This
ensures
that
the
carve-outs 
accomplish
their
intended
objective
without
being
overly
broad
and
completely
overriding
the
underlying 
indemnity
arrangement. 
74Exhibit
6.4
 
Sample
Clarification
of
Carve-Out
Language
This
section
shall
in
no
way
limit
or
modify
the
general
indemnities
contained
within
this
MSA, 
except
as
to
responsibility
for
that
particular
category
of
property
damage
identified
in
this
section, 
such
that
any
exceptions
for
particular/discrete
items
of
property
damage
in
no
way
affect
any 
protection,
release,
or
indemnification
for
bodily
injury,
illness,
death
or
damage
to
non-specified 
property.
Allocating
True
Third-Party
Losses
As
mentioned
earlier,
MSAs
often
use
the
term
“Operator
Group”
to
refer
to
the
operator
and
its
affiliates, 
partners,
owners,
agents,
contractors,
and
subcontractors.
Likewise,
they
use
the
term
“Contractor
Group” 
to
refer
to
the
contractor
with
whom
the
operator
is
contracting,
plus
its
affiliates,
partners,
owners, 
agents,
contractors,
and
subcontractors.
MSAs
sometimes
do
not
specifically
address
allocation
of
losses 
or
damages
incurred
by
true
third
parties—individuals
or
entities
that
are
not
included
in
the
definition
of 
either
“Operator
Group”
or
“Contractor
Group.” 
Land
owners,
passersby,
and
motorists
on
nearby
highways
are
the
typical
third
parties.
When
the
MSA
is 
silent
as
to
those
types
of
damages,
the
general
assumption
is
that
true
third-party
losses
will
be
allocated 
“at
law”—meaning
that
the
general
tort
law
of
the
governing
jurisdiction
will
determine
the
allocation
of 
losses.
In
most
jurisdictions,
that
would
mean
that
each
party
would
be
responsible
for
losses
or
damages 
to
the
extent
of
its
own
negligence
or
other
fault. 
Some
contractors,
however,
include
general
statements
in
their
MSA
form
that
any
risk
that
is
not 
specifically
allocated
to
the
contractor
is
the
operator’s
responsibility.
This
arguably
includes
true 
third-party
losses. 
Rather
than
remaining
silent
on
the
issue,
the
MSA
should
state
affirmatively
that
each
party
is 
responsible
for
third-party
damage
“to
the
extent,
but
only
to
the
extent”
caused
by
that
party.
This
should 
remove
any
ambiguity
about
the
general
allocation
of
third-party
losses.
Exhibit
6.5
provides
a
simple 
example
of
that
language. 
75Exhibit
6.5
 
Sample
MSA
Third-Party
Liability
Provision
Each
Party
shall
protect,
defend,
indemnify,
and
hold
harmless
the
other
Party
Group
from
and 
against
any
and
all
Claims
on
account
of
bodily
injury,
illness,
death,
or
damage
to
property
of
any 
Third
Party
to
the
extent
that
those
Claims
are
caused
by
(or
are
attributable
to)
its
own
negligence 
or
other
fault.
“Third
Party”
means
any
person
or
entity
that
is
not
a
member
of
“Operator
Group”
or 
“Contractor
Group.”
Even
when
third-party
losses
remain
generally
“at
law,”
there
are
typically
exceptions
to
that
framework. 
Some
standard
exceptions
are
pollution
claims,
claims
for
reservoir
damage,
and
claims
for
loss
of 
hydrocarbons.
In
particular,
allocation
related
to
third-party
pollution
claims
varies
and
can
be
a 
contentious
negotiating
point. 
Allocating
Pollution
Risks
Although
many
third-party
liabilities
remain
unallocated,
pollution
risks
(at
least
some
of
them)
are 
typically
addressed
explicitly.
One
common
approach
is
to
allocate
liability
for
pollution
claims
to
the 
parties
that
owned
the
source
of
the
pollutant.
Under
a
variation
of
that
general
approach,
the
contractor
is 
responsible
for
pollution
that
originates
from
its
equipment
and
occurs
above
the
surface
of
the
land
or 
water.
Under
another
variation,
the
contractor
accepts
liability
only
for
pollution
(1)
originating
from 
above
the
land
surface,
(2)
wholly
in
the
contractor’s
possession
and
control,
and
(3)
directly
associated 
with
the
contractor’s
equipment.
That
narrow
approach
places
very
little
responsibility
on
the
contractor. 
The
scope
of
the
pollution
indemnification
is
also
important.
Does
the
indemnification
apply
to
“all 
claims
arising
out
of
or
related
to”
the
specified
type
of
pollution?
Or
does
it
apply
only
to
“all
costs
of 
cleanup
and
remediation
of”
the
specified
type
of
pollution?
These
are
important
questions,
because 
insurance
for
pollution
is
often
very
limited.
Parties
should
consult
their
insurance
brokers
to
ensure
that 
their
insurance
programs
cover
the
scope
of
their
pollution
responsibilities.
This
is
particularly
important 
with
respect
to
pollution
risks
because
most
insurance
programs
contain
pollution
limitations. 
With
these
comments
in
mind,
Exhibit
6.6
shows
a
possible
revision
of
a
pollution
indemnity
provision. 
76Exhibit
6.6
 
Sample
Revised
Pollution
Indemnity
Provision
Contractor
shall
assume
all
responsibility
for
claims
arising
out
of
or
in
any
way
related
to
for
control 
and
removal
of
pollution
or
contamination,
which
originates
above
the
surface
of
the
land
or
water 
from
spills
of
fuels,
lubricants,
motor
oils,
pipe
dope,
paints,
solvents,
ballast,
bilge
and
garbage,
or 
that
is
in
Contractor’s
possession
and
or
control
and
or
directly
associated
with
Contractor’s 
equipment
and
facilities.
These
types
of
changes
to
the
language
of
a
typical
pollution
indemnity
provision
in
an
MSA
are 
particularly
important
if
the
MSA
shifts
all
unallocated
pollution
risks
to
the
operator. 
Drafting
Indemnity
Provisions
Courts
have
held
that
the
intent
for
one
party
(as
indemnitee)
to
be
exculpated
or
protected
by
another 
party
(as
indemnitor)
from
liability
caused
by
the
indemnitee’s
own
negligence
must
be
“clear
and 
unequivocal.”
In
many
cases,
the
jurisprudence
has
determined
that
terms
once
considered
sufficiently 
clear
are
not.
For
example,
it
has
been
held
that
the
words
“howsoever
arising
in
any
way
directly
or 
indirectly”
in
a
hold
harmless
clause
do
not
adequately
show
an
intention
to
indemnify
another
party
for 
its
own
negligence. 
Include
“Magic
Language”
in
the
Indemnity
Provision
The
key
to
an
effective
indemnity
provision
is
to
include
“magic
language”
that
meets
the
strict
drafting 
standards
imposed
by
courts
in
many
jurisdictions
to
create
an
enforceable
indemnity
provision. 
Because
MSAs
often
contemplate
work
in
multiple
states,
it
is
a
good
practice
to
draft
MSAs
to
the 
highest
drafting
standard
of
the
possible
governing
jurisdictions.
Texas
courts
maintain
the
most
stringent 
standard.
Under
the
Texas
Fair
Notice
Doctrine,
the
intent
to
indemnify
another
party
for
its
own 
negligence
must
not
only
be
stated
in
“clear
and
unequivocal
terms,”
but
the
provision
must
also
meet
the 
Uniform
Commercial
Code
definition
of
“conspicuous,”
typically
including
bold
fonts,
separate
headings, 
and
other
visual
devices
designed
to
draw
the
reader’s
attention
to
the
provision.
The
2003
International 
Association
of
Drilling
Contractors
(IADC)
Daywork
Contract
contains
a
good
example
of
“magic 
language”
that
should
be
enforceable
under
the
standards
of
any
jurisdiction,
including
Texas.
It
is

in

Paragraph
14.13.
Beware
of
“Floating”
Magic
Language
The
IADC
language
shown
in
Exhibit
6.7
states
that
“all
releases,
indemnity
obligations
and/or
liabilities” 
are
subject
to
the
so-called
magic
language.
This
is
a
good,
efficient
approach:
rather
than
repeating
the 
magic
language
in
each
indemnity
provision,
the
IADC
approach
states
the
standard
once
and
it
applies 
throughout
the
contract.
But
the
parties
must
be
careful
that
this
“floating”
magic
language
does
not 
broaden
the
intended
framework
by
(1)
undoing
any
intentional
limitations
on
the
indemnities
or
(2) 
inadvertently
importing
magic
language
to
provisions
that
the
parties
did
not
intend
to
be
subject
to
magic 
language. 
The
Difference
between
“Indemnify”
and
“Release”
An
agreement
to
“indemnify”
is
different
from
an
agreement
to
“release.”
Courts
and
contracts
often 
loosely
use
the
term
“indemnify”
to
mean
“release
and
indemnify,”
but
the
differences
can
be
significant. 
•
A
true
indemnity
agreement
determines
which
party
to
a
contract
will
ultimately
bear
the
risk
of 
injury
to
a
third
party.
•
A
release
pertains
to
claims
by
the
parties
themselves;
it
surrenders
legal
rights
or
obligations 
between
the
parties
to
an
agreement.
In
the
Sundance
case,
12
the
pertinent
contract
required
that
one
party
“
indemnify
and
hold
harmless
[the 
other
party]
from
and
against
any
and
all
claims
...
which
may
be
brought
against
[that
other
party] 
incidental
to,
arising
out
of
or
in
connection
with
the
work
to
be
done.”
But
the
court
refused
to
read
that 
provision
to
create
a
release,
noting
that
the
“clause
now
before
us
is
devoid
of
language
in
any
way 
signaling
plaintiff’s
intention
to
release
defendant
as
well
as
holding
it
harmless
from
actions
by
third 
parties.”
The
court
noted
that
agreements
to
indemnify
a
party
against
actions
by
third
parties
and
to 
release
the
other
party
from
any
claims
a
party
itself
might
bring
are
“two
different
animals.”
Because 
courts
strictly
construe
exculpatory
provisions,
the
best
practice
is
to
be
very
specific
and
to
state
that 
each
party
“shall
release,
protect,
defend,
indemnify,
and
hold
harmless”
the
other
party. 
To
avoid
any
reason
for
doubt,
the
indemnity
provision
should
specify
that
the
hold
harmless/indemnity 
obligations
apply
even
to
losses
arising
out
of
strict
liability,
preexisting
conditions,
and
breach
of 
contract
or
warranty.
Furthermore,
if
the
parties
intend
that
attorneys’
fees
will
be
awarded
for
an 
indemnitee’s
pursuit
of
hold
harmless/indemnity
protection,
that
must
be
specified,
too. 
Indemnity
for
Gross
Negligence
and
Punitive
Damages
Whatever
decision
parties
make
regarding
allocation
of
gross
negligence/punitive
damages,
they
must
be 
careful
to
maintain
harmony
with
their
other
contracts
and
MSAs.
In
other
words,
this
is
another
area
in 
which
parties
can
get
themselves
into
“pass-through”
problems. 
78In
the
multidistrict
litigation
surrounding
the
April
2010
Deepwater
Horizon
incident,
a
court
order 
focused
on
the
difference
between
a
release
and
an
indemnity
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
parties 
can
agree
to
shift
liability
for
gross
negligence
and
punitive
damages. 
By
way
of
background,
“gross
negligence”
has
been
defined
in
various
cases
as
“want
of
even
slight
care 
and
diligence,”
“want
of
that
diligence
which
even
careless
men
are
accustomed
to
exercise,”
and
conduct 
that
indicates
that
a
party
“had
actual
subjective
knowledge
of
an
extreme
risk
of
serious
harm.”
The 
concept
is
relatively
similar
throughout
U.S.
jurisdictions.
Proving
gross
negligence
is
difficult
because 
the
term
refers
to
particularly
bad
behavior—behavior
that
goes
beyond
ordinary
negligence. 
On
principle,
some
parties
think
that
would-be
indemnitees
should
not
be
exculpated
from
the 
consequences
of
their
own
gross
negligence
(or,
similarly,
“willful
misconduct”
or
punitive
damages). 
Therefore,
they
prefer
to
exclude
gross
negligence,
willful
misconduct,
and
punitive
damages
from
the 
scope
of
the
indemnity
obligations.
By
contrast,
other
parties
reason
that
carving
those
concepts
out
of
the 
indemnity
obligations
invites
costly
litigation.
These
competing
viewpoints
can
cause
problems
during 
negotiations. 
Whether
parties
actually
can
exculpate
one
another
from
gross
negligence
and
punitive
damages
is
an 
open
question.
It
might
be
against
public
policy
to
do
so.
In
the
Deepwater
Horizon
litigation,
the
district 
court
held
that
the
public
policy
question
hinges
on
whether
the
exculpation
is
a
release
or
an
indemnity. 
Significant
jurisprudence
holds
that
parties
may
not
release
one
another
from
the
consequences
of
the 
released
party’s
own
negligence.
But
the
district
court
decision
in
the
Deepwater
Horizon
case 
distinguishes
those
cases
from
an
“indemnity”
situation
and
holds
that
public
policy
does
not
bar
parties 
from
agreeing
to
indemnify
one
another
from
the
consequences
of
the
indemnitee’s
gross
negligence. 
Punitive
damages
are
yet
another
story.
The
court
in
the
Deepwater
Horizon
case
noted
that
the
purpose 
of
punitive
damages
would
be
defeated
if
the
burden
of
such
damages
were
shifted
by
contractual 
indemnity.
Therefore,
the
court
held
that
agreements
to
indemnify
another
party
for
punitive
damages 
violate
public
policy.
Even
if
the
parties
are
inclined
to
provide
exculpation
for
gross
negligence
or 
punitive
damages,
and
even
if
public
policy
does
not
forbid
that,
insurability
is
an
additional 
consideration.
The
parties
may
not
have
insurance
for
punitive
damages.
In
fact,
whether
insurance
for 
punitive
damages
violates
public
policy
is
also
uncertain
in
many
jurisdictions. 
Assuming
that
exculpation
for
punitive
damages
and/or
gross
negligence
can
survive
public
policy 
scrutiny,
parties
must
be
careful
not
to
indemnify
for
gross
negligence
in
Contract
A
and
carve
gross 
negligence
out
of
the
indemnity
obligation
in
Contract
B.
That
could
create
another
problem
like
the 
“
Foreman
problem”
mentioned
earlier. 
Battle
of
the
“Notwithstandings”
Contractual
provisions,
such
as
standard
warranty
waivers,
often
include
statements
that
“notwithstanding 
anything
in
this
agreement
to
the
contrary,
Contractor
shall
have
no
responsibility
for....”
These 
provisions
may
conflict
with
similar
“notwithstanding”
notions
in
the
general
indemnity
sections.
The 
typical
assumption
the
parties
make
is
that
the
risk
allocation
provisions
will
“trump”
any
other
provision 
in
the
contract.
Therefore,
any
provisions
that
relate
to
risk
allocation
or
tend
to
create
contractual 
responsibility
should
be
expressly
“subject
to”
the
parties’
general
indemnity
obligations.
Otherwise, 
there
may
be
an
irreconcilable
conflict
(an
ambiguity)
within
the
MSA. 
Anti-Indemnity
Acts
It
might
not
matter
that
the
parties
draft
impeccable
indemnity
arrangements
that
thoroughly
and 
accurately
reflect
their
intentions.
Several
states—Louisiana,
Texas,
New
Mexico,
and
Wyoming—have 
oil
field
anti-indemnity
acts
that,
based
on
public
policy,
invalidate
contractual
provisions
that
exculpate 
parties
from
loss
and
damage
caused
by
their
own
fault. 
Additionally,
about
40
states
have
construction
anti-indemnity
statutes
that
do
the
same
thing.
These 
construction
anti-indemnity
statutes
generally
contain
far-reaching
prohibitions.
For
example,
the 
Louisiana
construction
anti-indemnity
act
applies
to
“any
agreement
for
the
design,
construction, 
alteration,
renovation,
repair,
or
maintenance
of
a
building,
structure,
highway,
road,
bridge,
water
line,
79sewer
line,
oil
line,
gas
line,
appurtenance,
or
other
improvement
to
real
property,
including
any
moving, 
demolition,
or
excavation.”
While
these
construction
acts
are
apparently
not
intended
to
apply
to
true
oil 
and
gas
operations,
an
aggressive
and
disappointed
contracting
party
might
be
tempted
to
seek
refuge 
from
an
indemnity
obligation
based
on
these
acts’
broad
language. 
Anti-indemnity
statutes
are
based
on
a
perception
that
operators
and
contractors
have
inequitable 
negotiating
positions,
a
presumption
that
forcing
each
party
to
bear
losses
according
to
its
own
degree
of 
fault
will
promote
safety,
and
the
notion
that
non-fault-based
risk
allocation
is
fundamentally
unfair.
Each 
oil
field
anti-indemnity
act
is
unique,
with
state-specific
applications,
exceptions,
carve-outs,
and
possible 
work-arounds.
Parties
must
understand
these
statutes,
know
which
ones
may
apply
to
their
work,
and
plan 
for
their
potential
applicability
when
crafting
their
indemnity
arrangements—because
if
any
one
of
these 
statutes
applies
to
a
particular
claim,
the
parties’
risk
allocation
arrangement
can
be
unenforceable,
and 
the
responsibility
would
be
allocated
“at
law.” 
Insurance
The
party
responsible
for
a
particular
exposure
for
indemnity
purposes
should
also
be
the
party 
responsible
for
insuring
that
exposure.
Coordinating
insurance
coverage
with
indemnity
obligations
is 
therefore
essential.
MSAs
should
not
only
require
certain
insurance
protections
but
also
ensure
that
the 
insurance
provisions
dovetail
with
the
indemnity
and
other
risk
allocation
provisions
in
the
MSA. 
With
regard
to
risk
allocation
in
MSAs,
insurance
serves
several
important
purposes. 
•
Insurance
guards
against
the
insolvency
of
the
indemnitor.
•
Under
some
circumstances,
the
insurance
coverage
is
valid
whereas
the
indemnity
obligations
are 
not
(e.g.,
certain
situations
involving
the
Texas
and
Louisiana
oil
field
anti-indemnity
acts).
•
The
availability
of
adequate
insurance
can
ease
tension
between
companies
(which
are
often
still 
working
together)
in
the
event
of
a
loss.
The
MSA’s
indemnity
obligations
must
dovetail
with
the
insurance
requirements.
Here
are
a
few
tips
for 
accomplishing
that
goal. 
•
Be
careful
not
to
make
the
insurance
requirements
in
the
MSA
overly
broad.
They
should
all
be 
limited
“to
the
extent
of
the
risks
and
liabilities
assumed”
by
the
party
procuring
the
particular 
insurance
coverage.
This
is
important
to
prevent
one
party’s
insurance
program
from
extending
to 
losses
that
are
not
the
named
insured’s
responsibility
under
the
terms
of
the
MSA.
•
Use
the
“Group”
concept.
If
the
MSA
provides
for
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity,
make
sure
that
all 
of
the
insurance
requirements
extend
to
the
indemnitee’s
entire
“Group.”
•
Employ
the
“big
three”
insurance
protections
described
below.
The
“Big
Three”
Insurance
Protections
All
MSAs
should
include
provisions
requiring
“the
big
three”
critical
insurance
protections: 
•
additional
insured
status,
•
waiver
of
subrogation
protection,
and
•
primary
and
noncontributory
coverage.
Additional
Insured
Status
Each
party
(and
its
indemnified
“Group,”
if
the
MSA
includes
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity)
should
be 
named
as
an
additional
insured
on
the
other
parties’
insurance
“to
the
extent
of
the
risks
and
liabilities 
assumed”
by
that
other
party.
Additional
insured
status
provides
important
benefits.
It
increases
the 
available
amount
of
insurance
protection
for
a
particular
casualty;
it
insulates
against
negative
loss 
history;
and
it
gives
direct
rights
against
the
other
party’s
insurer.
Also,
it
might
increase
the
chance
of
80recovery
for
“bad
faith”
damages
in
the
event
of
a
coverage
battle. 
Additional
insured
status
may
not
be
available
in
certain
insurance
coverages
(e.g.,
workers
compensation 
coverage,
OEE/COW,
first-party
property
policies,
and
professional
liability
coverage).
But
it
should
be 
obtained
on
any
coverage
related
to
the
work
for
which
it
is
available. 
Parties
should
be
careful
to
ensure
that
the
additional
insured
protection
is
not
limited
inappropriately. 
Some
additional
insured
endorsements
are
narrow,
in
that
they
only
apply
in
certain
circumstances.
This 
could
be
bad
for
both
parties.
For
the
party
added
as
additional
insured
on
a
narrow
form,
its
own 
insurance
program
could
unnecessarily
be
called
on
to
respond
to
a
claim,
with
negative
effects
on
that 
party’s
loss
history.
And
the
other
party
(the
indemnitor)
could
be
exposed
to
potential
uninsured
liability, 
because
it
agreed
to
provide
indemnity
protection
for
a
particular
claim,
but
the
indemnitee
is
not
eligible 
for
corresponding
insurance
protection. 
Waiver
of
Subrogation
The
second
of
the
“big
three”
protections
is
a
waiver
of
subrogation
provision.
Each
party’s
insurance 
policy
should
contain
this
protection
to
prevent
the
other
party’s
insurer
from
asserting
a
claim
against
the 
indemnified
party
for
its
share
of
fault
for
a
casualty.
A
waiver
of
subrogation
provision
can
effectively 
produce
some
of
the
same
benefits
as
additional
insured
status
can
(e.g.,
an
insurer
cannot
subrogate 
against
its
own
policyholder).
It
also
can
apply
to
policies
for
which
additional
insured
status
is 
unavailable
(property
policies,
workers
compensation
policies,
and
OEE/COW
policies). 
Primary
and
Noncontributory
Coverage
The
final
“big
three”
protection
is
for
the
indemnitor’s
coverage
to
be
“primary
and
noncontributory”
to 
the
indemnitee’s
insurance
policies.
Most
policies
contain
“other
insurance”
clauses
that
aim
to
share
the 
risk
of
exposure
with
(or
shift
the
entire
risk
to)
other
policies—of
any
party—that
may
cover
the
same 
loss.
Without
a
statement
of
primacy,
the
“other
insurance”
clause
could
frustrate
the
parties’
intent
that 
the
indemnitor’s
coverage
respond
to
the
losses
that
have
been
allocated
to
it
under
the
MSA. 
Other
Important
Insurance
Protections
It
is
important
that
the
insurance
protections
do
not
limit
the
indemnity
obligations.
In
other
words,
the 
indemnity
obligations
should
not
be
limited
by
the
dollar
amount
of
required
insurance.
The
Dickerson 
case
13
held
that,
based
on
the
language
of
the
contract
applicable
in
that
case,
the
indemnitor’s
indemnity 
obligation
was
limited
to
the
amount
of
insurance
required
under
the
contract. 
Parties
should
expressly
negate
any
implication
that
insurance
coverage
limits
the
indemnity
obligations. 
The
insurance
provisions
should
also
take
into
consideration
any
potentially
applicable
anti-indemnity 
statute;
this
might
necessitate
the
use
of
state-specific
insurance
protections
or
endorsements. 
Insuring
Contractual
Liability
In
the
oil
field,
parties
often
assume
indirect
responsibility
for
losses
by
contractually
assuming
risk
for 
which
they
would
not
be
responsible
without
that
contract.
Contractual
liability
may
be—and
often 
is—excluded
from
a
general
liability
form.
And
when
it
is
covered,
it
is
often
covered
only
through
an 
exception
to
the
general
exclusion.
That
is
not
comforting.
Many
policy
forms
expose
the
policyholder
to 
potentially
catastrophic
uninsured
losses.
For
example,
some
forms
provide
coverage
only
if
the
named 
policyholder
is
partially
at
fault.
That
can
be
devastating
if
the
indemnitee
is
solely
at
fault.
Operators
and 
contractors
should
be
cautious
about
the
narrow
forms
used
in
the
insurance
market
and
take
steps
to 
avoid
its
effects. 
Each
party
should
first
make
sure
that
its
own
obligations
are
fully
insured.
The
MSA
should
also
specify 
that
each
party
must
obtain
contractual
liability
coverage
that
is
broad
enough
to
fund
all
of
the
liabilities 
undertaken
within
the
indemnity
provisions
of
the
contract.
Exhibit
6.8
provides
sample
language. 
81Exhibit
6.8
 
Sample
MSA
Contractual
Liability
Coverage
Requirement
The
indemnifying
party’s
contractual
liability
coverage
must
provide
coverage
for
all
of
the
release, 
defense,
indemnity,
and
hold
harmless
obligations
undertaken
by
that
party
in
Section
[_]
of
this 
MSA.
At
the
very
least,
this
type
of
provision
in
the
MSA
should
alert
the
parties
(and
their
insurance
brokers, 
who
should
be
reviewing
the
insurance
and
indemnity
obligations)
to
the
need
for
broad
form
contractual 
liability
coverage.
Moreover,
it
can
rebut
an
argument
that
the
indemnitor
complied
with
the
technical 
contractual
liability
requirements
by
providing
anemic
coverage. 
Larger
companies
(like
big
oil
field
operators
and
service
contractors)
might
have
the
leverage
to
obtain 
manuscript
policy
endorsements.
(A
manuscript
endorsement
is
a
nonstandard
endorsement
that
is
drafted 
to
meet
the
needs
of
a
particular
insured.)
Considering
the
expansive
use
of
contractual
risk
allocation
in 
the
oil
field,
pursuing
a
manuscript
contractual
liability
endorsement
may
be
worthwhile.
Exhibit
6.9 
provides
an
example
of
a
manuscript
endorsement
that
at
least
one
insurer
in
the
oil
patch
has
agreed
to 
for
a
moderately
sized
onshore
operator.

Without

the

coverage
provided
within
the
Policy,
including
but
not
limited 
to
that
which
is
provided
through
the
definition
of
“insured
contract,”
this
Policy
is
specifically 
endorsed
to
cover
the
indemnity
and
hold
harmless
obligations
undertaken
by
the
Named

in 
a

contract,
master
service
agreement,
and/or
similar
agreement.
The
Proper
Use
of
Insurance
Certificates
As
with
other
contracts,
insurance
certificates
should
provide
assurance
that
the
parties
named
in
the 
certificates
are
carrying
the
proper
insurance
coverage.
But
many
certificates—including
the
standard 
Association
for
Cooperative
Operations
Research
and
Development
(ACORD)
forms—contain 
worrisome
limitations
regarding
reliance
on
the
certificate
and
notice
of
cancellation.
Most
certificate
of 
insurance
forms
include
only
very
basic
information
and
fail
to
alert
the
additional
insured
to
significant 
endorsements,
exclusions,
and
other
conditions
that
might
significantly
limit
the
value
of
the
coverage. 
One
court
even
held
that
those
who
take
such
certificates
at
face
value
do
so
at
their
own
risk. 
Considering
these
limitations,
parties
might
want
to
use
customized
insurance
certificates
that
are
drafted 
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
MSA’s
insurance
requirements.
These
custom
certificates
can
expressly 
certify,
without
disclaimer
or
limitation,
that
the
proper
insurance
is
in
place
and
describe
key
policy 
endorsements
and
exclusions.
This
approach
often
meets
resistance
from
agents
and
brokers,
but
it
can 
give
both
parties
comfort
that
they
are
getting
what
they
bargained
for. 
Even
without
a
customized
certificate
of
insurance,
parties
should
reserve
the
right
to
require
proper 
adjustments
to
the
certificate
or
to
the
insurance
program
if
significant
information
is
wrong
or
missing. 
For
example,
the
MSA
might
state:
“Each
party
shall
provide
an
insurance
certificate
on
a
form 
satisfactory
to
the
other
party,
evidencing
that
the
above
coverages
are
in
place.”
This
helps
to
alert
the 
parties
to
potential
deficiencies
in
their
insurance
programs.
Although
the
certificate
typically
cannot
alter 
the
policy,
it
might
provide
appropriate
extrinsic
evidence
to
determine
the
policy’s
intent
if
there
is
an 
ambiguity
in
the
policy. 
Role
of
the
Insurance
Agent
or
Broker
The
insurance
agent
or
broker
should
be
involved
in
reviewing
MSAs.
An
insured
should
provide
the 
agent
or
broker
with
copies
of
the
company’s
contracts
for
review.
The
agent
or
broker
should
be
able
to 
spot
issues
and
confirm
that
the
company
has
the
right
coverages,
including
those
required
by
the
MSA. 
This
is
important
because
a
party’s
failure
to
obtain
insurance
as
required
by
a
contract
makes
that
party 
the
“insurer”
of
its
obligations. 
Particular
Provisions
Bearing
on
Risk
Allocation
This
section
of
the
chapter
discusses
the
following
provisions
in
MSAs
that
warrant
special
comment 
because
they
have
a
bearing
on
risk
allocation. 
•
Warranty
and
indemnity
provisions
•
Independent
contractor
provisions
•
Statutory
employer
provisions
(for
Louisiana)
•
Choice
of
law
provisions
•
Savings
clauses
•
Primacy
clauses
•
Consequential
damages
waivers
Warranty
and
Indemnity
Provisions
83Many
contractors
insist
on
warranty
limitations
and
warranty
disclaimers
that
state
that 
 
Notwithstanding
anything
in
this
agreement
to
the
contrary,
Contractor
shall
have
no 
obligation—and
Operator
shall
have
no
remedy—for
Contractor’s
breach
of
any
warranty 
(express
or
implied)
other
than
those
remedies
expressly
provided
in
this
warranty
section 
[typically
re-performance
or
replacement
of
the
defective
work]. 
Similarly,
the
MSA’s
basic
indemnity
provisions
often
include
statements
like
the
following. 
 
Notwithstanding
anything
in
this
agreement
to
the
contrary,
Contractor
shall
release,
protect, 
defend,
indemnify,
and
hold
harmless
Company
Group
from
and
against
any
and
all
Claims 
[broadly
defined]
on
account
of
bodily
injury,
illness,
death,
or
damage
to
property
of
Contractor 
Group
...
REGARDLESS
OF
CAUSE. 
This
is
an
example
of
the
battle
of
the
notwithstandings. 
What
if
a
contractor’s
employee
is
injured
as
a
result
of
the
contractor’s
breach
of
warranty?
Which 
provision
controls?
The
parties
almost
certainly
intend
for
the
indemnity
provision
to
apply
to
that 
loss—for
the
contractor
to
be
responsible
for
claims
by
its
injured
employee.
However,
an
overly 
aggressive
party
might
argue
that
the
warranty
limitation
applies
to
the
loss.
Therefore,
the
warranty 
limitation
should
include
an
express
statement
that
it
does
not
limit
the
contractor’s
general
indemnity
and 
insurance
obligations. 
Warranty
provisions
also
cause
negotiating
disputes
because
many
contractors
resist
the
word
“warranty” 
(which
means
“guaranty”)
and
creates
a
type
of
strict
liability
with
regard
to
that
obligation.
Contractors 
are
understandably
reluctant
to
expose
themselves
to
that
high
standard.
Moreover,
contractors
rightly 
question
whether
the
“warranty”
could
be
used
by
the
operator
to
circumvent
the
general
risk
allocation 
framework.
So
in
certain
circumstances,
it
is
appropriate
to
replace
the
word
“warrant”
with
“shall.”
Then 
the
contractor
has
not
guaranteed
a
result,
but
it
is
still
obligated
to
perform
properly. 
Independent
Contractor
Provisions
Independent
contractor
provisions
can
help
to
minimize
the
risk
that
a
court
would
determine
that
the 
operator
acted
negligently
in
causing
an
injury.
Considering
the
typical
oil
field
risk
allocation 
arrangement
(“you
take
your
people
and
property
and
I
take
mine”),
this
helps
contractors
as
well
as 
operators
because
it
decreases
the
possible
tort
exposure
for
which
contractors
may
have
to
indemnify
if 
their
employees
get
injured
on
the
job.
A
sample
independent
contractor
provision,
with
the
key
language 
shown
in
italics,
appears
in
Exhibit
6.10. 
84Exhibit
6.10
 
Sample
Independent
Contractor
Provision
Contractor
shall
at
all
times
be
an
independent
contractor
,
and
nothing
in
this
Contract
shall
be 
construed
as
creating
the
relationship
of
principal
and
agent,
or
employer
or
employee,
between 
Operator
and
Contractor
or
between
Operator
and
Contractor’s
agents
or
employees.
Contractor 
shall
have
no
authority
to
hire
any
persons
on
behalf
of
Operator,
and
any
and
all
persons
whom 
Contractor
may
employ
shall
be
deemed
to
be
solely
the
employees
of
Contractor.
Contractor
shall 
have
control
and
management
of
the
Work,
the
selection
of
employees
and
the
fixing
of
their
hours 
of
labor,
and
no
right
is
reserved
to
Operator
to
direct
or
control
the
manner
in
which
the
Work
is 
performed,
as
distinguished
from
the
result
to
be
accomplished.
Nothing
herein
contained
shall
be 
construed
to
authorize
Contractor
to
incur
any
debt,
liability,
or
obligation
of
any
nature
for
or
on 
behalf
of
Operator.
A
successful
“independent
contractor
defense”
exculpates
the
operator
from
liability
where
an 
independent
contractor
handles
the
details
of
operations.
This
protection
is
particularly
important
for
the 
operator
if
the
contractor’s
indemnity
or
insurance
protections
are
unenforceable,
perhaps
because
of
an 
anti-indemnity
act. 
Louisiana
Statutory
Employer
Provisions
Louisiana
law
has
an
interesting
and
unusual
feature:
the
“statutory
employer”
concept.
A
statutory 
employer
is
immune
from
tort
claims
asserted
by
its
“statutory
employees.”
“A
statutory
employer 
relationship
shall
exist
whenever
the
services
or
work
provided
by
the
immediate
employer
is 
contemplated
by
or
included
in
a
contract
between
the
principal
and
any
person
or
entity
other
than
the 
employee’s
immediate
employer.”
14 
Louisiana
law
also
provides
that,
except
in
those
instances
covered
by
the
two-contract
theory,
a
statutory 
employer
relationship
“shall
not
exist
...
unless
there
is
a
written
contract
between
the
principal
and
a 
contractor
which
is
the
employee’s
immediate
employer
or
his
statutory
employer,
which
recognizes
the 
principal
as
a
statutory
employer.”
15 
Therefore,
statutory
employer
provisions
are
essential
in
any
MSA
when
there
may
be
work
performed
in 
or
offshore
of
Louisiana.
If
there
is
a
statutory
employer
provision
in
the
contract,
a
rebuttable 
presumption
of
statutory
employer
status
exists,
triggering
the
immunity
for
the
statutory
employer. 
Demonstrating
that
the
work
was
not
integrally
related
or
essential
to
the
ability
of
the
principal
to 
generate
its
goods,
products,
or
services
is
the
only
way
to
overcome
the
presumption. 
This
mechanism
also
helps
contractors.
To
the
extent
the
operator
is
protected
by
the
statutory
employer 
provision,
the
contractor
decreases
its
liability
under
its
indemnity
obligation.
Therefore,
contractors 
should
not
resist
these
clauses. 
Choice
of
Law
Provision
Many
companies
prefer
to
apply
the
law
of
their
home
state
to
their
MSAs.
Parties
are
comfortable
with 
their
home
state’s
law
and
likely
have
relationships
with
local
lawyers.
They
may
like
particular
features 
of
the
law
of
their
home
state.
However,
the
law
of
one
party’s
home
state
may
not
be
favorable
in
all 
circumstances.
Courts
generally
uphold
choice
of
law
provisions
if
one
of
the
parties
or
the
work
to
be 
performed
has
a
sufficient
relationship
to
that
state,
but
either
party
may
argue
that
application
of
that 
state’s
law
would
be
improper
on
public
policy
grounds. 
Selecting
applicable
law
deserves
serious
consideration,
taking
into
account
anti-indemnity
acts,
implied 
warranty
acts,
location
of
the
work,
and
enforceability.
To
make
sure
that
the
chosen
state’s
conflicts 
rules
will
not
apply,
the
parties
should
state
that
the
selection
is
“
exclusive
of
conflicts
of
law
principles.” 
Savings
Clauses
Savings
clauses
are
important,
particularly
when
an
anti-indemnity
statute
or
other
act
might
arise
that 
could
invalidate
any
of
the
provisions.
Parties
should
not
rely
on
courts
to
excise
improper
concepts
from 
the
MSA.
Courts
may
instead
strike
the
entire
provision—not
just
the
specific
offending
portion.
The
best
85way
to
retain
the
parties’
intent
is
to
formulate
the
provision
to
amend
offending
provisions
“to
the 
extent—
but
only
to
the
extent
—necessary
to
comply
with
applicable
law.” 
Primacy
Clauses
When
parties
use
work
orders,
delivery
tickets,
and
invoices
in
connection
with
an
MSA,
the
provisions 
of
those
documents
may
be
inconsistent
with
one
another.
Work
orders
are
necessary
to
memorialize
the 
scope
of
work,
specifications,
prices,
and
discrete
tasks,
but
many
work
orders
include
interest
provisions, 
releases,
and
even
insurance
and
indemnity
requirements.
The
parties
probably
do
not
intend
for
the
work 
order
to
trump
the
MSA,
so
primacy
clauses
are
important
to
negate
provisions
contrary
to
the
risk 
allocation
framework
of
the
MSA. 
Parties
should
ensure
(contractually,
in
the
MSA)
that
field
personnel
are
not
authorized
to
amend
the 
provisions
of
the
MSA,
but
parties
should
also
educate
field
personnel
that
they
have
no
authority
to
sign 
documents
or
execute
agreements
that
purport
to
impact
risk
allocation—particularly
because
many
of 
these
provisions
are
hidden
on
the
back
of
field
tickets
or
even
invoices. 
An
example
of
a
primacy
clause
that
also
contains
a
statement
prohibiting
field
personnel
from
modifying 
risk
allocation
concepts
is
shown
in
Exhibit
6.11. 
86Exhibit
6.11
 
Sample
Primacy
Clause
The
parties
specifically
object
to
and
reject
any
terms
contained
within
any
purchase
orders,
work 
orders,
invoices,
or
delivery
tickets
that
(i)
conflict
with
the
terms
of
this
MSA
or
(ii)
purport
to
impact 
the
allocation
of
risk
between
the
parties.
The
parties’
field
personnel
have
no
authority
to
modify
or 
amend
the
terms
of
this
MSA.
Consequential
Damages
Waiver
Waivers
of
consequential
damages
are
common,
and
both
parties
typically
want
them.
But
if
these 
provisions
are
not
carefully
drafted
and
scrutinized—because
both
parties
just
adopt
some
boilerplate 
language
that
someone
lifted
from
another
contract—they
can
be
potential
land
mines. 
Waivers
of
consequential
damages
may
not
cover
everything
that
the
parties
expect
them
to
cover. 
Operators
typically
want
to
avoid
loss
of
income
claims
by
contractors
that
are
unable
to
work
(or
rent
out 
their
expensive
tools)
due
to
the
operator’s
fault.
Similarly,
contractors
want
to
avoid
lost
revenue
and 
deferred
production
claims
by
operators
whose
wells
are
adversely
impacted
by
contractors’
negligence. 
Depending
on
the
circumstances,
however,
these
types
of
losses
might
not
be
“consequential
damages” 
unless
the
parties
expressly
define
them
to
be. 
In
some
jurisdictions,
“consequential
damage”
is
a
flexible
notion.
Under
maritime
law,
for
example, 
consequential
damages
have
been
defined
as
“those
unusual
or
indirect
costs
that,
although
caused
by
the 
defendant’s
conduct
in
a
literal
sense,
are
beyond
what
one
would
reasonably
expect
to
be
the
ordinary 
consequences
of
a
breach.”
Does
that
include
lost
profits?
Deferred
production?
Maybe
or
maybe
not.
To 
avoid
taking
chances
with
the
risk
allocation
program,
the
MSA
should
define
the
term
“consequential 
damage.”
The
definition
should
specifically
include
lost
hire,
lost
rental,
loss
of
business
opportunity,
and 
unabsorbed
overhead.
That
way,
the
exclusion
is
categorical
instead
of
situational.
The
parties
know
that 
certain
types
of
damages
are
always
excluded
and
that
the
exclusion
does
not
depend
on
the 
circumstances
of
the
loss. 
The
consequential
damages
waiver
must
fit
within
the
parties’
overarching
indemnity
programs.
One 
common
problem
is
for
MSAs
to
state:
“Notwithstanding
anything
contained
in
this
MSA
to
the
contrary, 
neither
party
shall
be
responsible
to
the
other
for
consequential,
special,
or
indirect
damages.”
But
what 
about
consequential
damages
that
are
part
of
a
claim
for
which
one
party
must
indemnify
the
other
party? 
Typically,
the
parties
really
mean
the
following:
“Notwithstanding
anything
contained
in
this
MSA
to
the 
contrary,
neither
party
shall
be
responsible
to
the
other
for
consequential,
special,
or
indirect
damages 
suffered
by
the
releasing
party
.”
Thus,
the
parties
may
be
assuming
unprotected
risk
if
they
offer 
protection
that
they
cannot
“pass
through”
in
other
contracts
and
MSAs.

A

be
a

of
a

Having
the
rights
of
an
insured
under
its
indemnitor’s
commercial
general 
liability
(CGL)
policy
is
viewed
by
most
indemnitees
as
a
way
of
backing
up
the
promise
of 
indemnification.
If
the
indemnity
agreement
proves
unenforceable
for
some
reason,
the
indemnitee
may 
still
be
able
to
obtain
coverage
for
its
liability
by
making
a
claim
directly
as
an
additional
insured
under 
the
indemnitor’s
CGL
policy.

anti-indemnity
statute
—A
law
that
defines
the
scope
of
legal
liability
that
one
party
may
transfer
to 
another
in
a
contract.
Anti-indemnity
statutes
may
prohibit
the
transfer
of
any
liability
attributable
to
the 
transferor’s
negligence;
or,
alternatively,
they
may
prohibit
only
the
transfer
of
liability
arising
from
the 
transferor’s
sole
negligence.
In
some
states,
anti-indemnity
statutes
also
limit
the
ability
of
one 
contracting
party
to
require
additional
insured
status
under
the
other
party’s
insurance
policies. 
Anti-indemnity

that
requires
one
contracting
party
to
respond
to 
certain

with
respect
to
the

liability
to
members
of
the
public
who
are

There
are
a 
number
of
types
of

differentiated
by
the

transfer.
The 
most
commonly
used

are
the
“broad,”
“intermediate,”
and
“limited”
form
hold

independent
contractor
—An
individual
or
company
that
has
signed
an
agreement
with
another
party
to 
perform
some
job
or
function
on
behalf
of
that
party
without
the
direction
or
oversight
of
the
party.
As 
respects
workers
compensation,
many
states
have
established
criteria
that
determine
whether
an 
individual
is
functioning
as
an
independent
contractor
or
employee.
A
worker
classified
as
an
independent 
contractor
and
not
an
employee
is
ineligible
to
receive
benefits
under
the
workers
compensation
policy
of 
the
other
party.
In
spite
of
the
rules
established,
the
delineation
of
an
independent
contractor
remains
in 
many
jurisdictions
a
legal
ambiguity.

that
sets
forth
the
duties
and
obligations
of
both
the 
operator

a
mineral
lease.
The
JOA
serves
several
purposes, 
including
identifying
the
property
interests
of
the
parties
in
the
mineral
lease,
designating
the
party
that
is 
to
act
as

and
setting
forth
the
method
for

and
for
the
allocation
of

for 
the

exploration
and
production
operations.

is
reciprocal
in
nature
and
is
based
on
ownership
of
property
and
personnel 
as
opposed
to
allocating
risk
based
on
fault.
Each
party
to
an

into
an
agreement 
in
advance
with
their
contractors
that
specifies
the

and
conditions
that
will
govern
the
contractors’ 
work.
The
agreement
is
typically
used
for
on-site
services
performed
by
oil
field
service
contractors
on
a 
repetitive
basis,
such
as
equipment
maintenance,
well
services,
and

modified
reciprocal
indemnity
—Hybrid
approach
that
could
include
a
number
of
variations.
In
one 
variety,
the
indemnitor
indemnifies
only

extends
that 
protection
to
the
other
parties’
contractors
and
subcontractors
as
well.

death,
and
loss/damage
to 
property
of
its
own
employees

not
to
its
contractors
and
subcontractors. 
noncontributory
insurance
—Insurance
issued
on
the
basis
that
it
will
not
seek
contribution
from
other 
insurance
policies
that
apply
to
a
covered

on
the
same
basis
(e.g.,
primary).
Requests
for
additional 
insured
status
sometimes
specify
that
it
be
provided
on
a
noncontributing
or
noncontributory
basis.
The 
additional
insured
in
such
cases
is
seeking
assurance
that
its
own
policy
will
not
be
asked
to
contribute
to 
a
covered
loss.

primary
coverage
—The
policy
that
responds
first
to
an
insured
loss,
either
on
a
first
dollar
basis
or
after 
allowing
for
a
deductible.
When
the
primary
coverage
limits
are
paid,
any
remaining
loss
is
covered
by 
whatever
excess
layer
of
insurance
may
be
in
place. 
release
—The
document
relinquishing
a
claim.
A
plaintiff

with
the
claim. 
roughnecks

make
the
connections
of
the
new

work
around
the
rig. 
royalty
interest
—Ownership
of
a
portion

the
resource
or
revenue
produced

retains
a
royalty
interest.
The
party
with
the
royalty
interest
is 
not
responsible
for
the
costs
and
liabilities
associated
with
the
exploration,
development,
and
operation
of 
a
well. 
savings

that
may
have
been
responsible
for
loss
covered

the
policy.
In
standard

91subrogation
waiver
—An
agreement
between
two
parties
in
which
one
party
agrees
to
waive
subrogation 
rights
against
another
in
the
event
of
a
loss.
The
intent
of
the
waiver
is
to
prevent
one
party’s
insurer
from 
pursuing
subrogation
against
the
other
party.
Generally,
insurance
policies
do
not
bar
coverage
if
an 
insured
waives
subrogation
against
a
third
party
before
a
loss.
However,
coverage
is
excluded
from
many 
policies
if
subrogation
is
waived
after
a
loss
because
to
do
so
would
violate
the
principle
of
indemnity. 
surface

—Agreement
in
which
the
lessee
agrees
to

working
interest
—A
percentage
of
ownership
in
a
mineral
lease
granting
its
owner
the
right
to
explore, 
drill,
and
produce
oil
and
gas
from
the
leased
property.
Working
interest
owners
bear
all
of
the
costs
and 
liabilities
associated
with
leasing,
drilling,
producing,
and
operating
a
well
but
share
in
only
part
of
the 
production
revenue
from
a
successful
well.
The
share
of
production
revenue
to
which
a
working
interest 
owner
is
entitled
will
always
be
smaller
than
the
share
of
costs
that
the
working
interest
owner
is
required 
to
bear,
with
the
balance
of
the
production
revenue
accruing
to
the
royalty
owners.
For
example,
the 
owner
of
a
100
percent
working
interest
in
a
lease
burdened
by
a
land
owner’s
royalty
of
20
percent 
would
be
required
to
pay
100
percent
of
the
exploration,
development,
and
operating
costs
but
would
be 
entitled
to
only
80
percent
of
the
production
revenue.
The
royalty
owner
would
be
entitled
to
the 
remaining
20
percent
of
production
revenue.
