1 Introduction 
This course is designed to give a moderately experienced insura nce person a detailed look at the legal 
liability exposures faced by the directors and officers of for- profit, publicly held corporations. The major 
areas this course addresses include (1) the common law and stat utory legal liability exposures to which 
the directors and officers of publicly held corporations are su bject, (2) legal defenses available to directors 
and officers when a claim is made against them, (3) the types o f situations that give rise to these claims, 
(4) the factors that insurers consider when underwriting direct ors and officers (D&O) policies for publicly 
held companies, and (5) the most  effective methods of preventin g and controlling claims against 
corporate directors and officers. 
The course is arranged as follows. 
 Chapter 1 describes the general nature of corporations and disc usses the functions that directors 
and officers perform within corporations. 
 Chapter 2 sets forth the common law duties owed by directors an d officers to the corporations 
they serve. These duties, collectively known as “fiduciary duti es,” include loyalty, obedience, and 
due care.  
 Chapter 3 discusses the liability exposures of directors and of ficers under federal securities 
laws—the single greatest exposure faced by directors and office rs of publicly traded corporations. 
 Chapter 4 discusses the numerous fed eral statutes that are not related to securities liability laws 
that can also form the basis for claims against corporate direc tors and officers. 
 Chapter 5 sets forth the most common defenses available to corp orate directors and officers when 
claims are made against them.  
 Chapter 6 explains the nature of securities class action claims , which are by far the costliest type 
of litigation to which corporate directors and officers are exp osed.  
 Chapter 7 examines four major sources of securities class actio n claims commonly brought 
against corporate directors and officers. These include claims from financial restatements, initial 
public offerings (IPOs), change-o f-control situations, and stoc k option backdating.  
 Chapter 8 explains the nature of what are known as “parallel pr oceedings.” Such claims are 
related to, but legally separat e from, the class action claims from which they originated. These 
proceedings include (1) derivative claims, (2) opt-out claims, (3) Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act (ERISA) stock-drop claims, and (4) regulatory and criminal proceedings. 
 Chapter 9 looks at two of the four major factors that D&O under writers consider when evaluating 
and pricing a D&O policy: the cor poration’s financial situation , and its competitive position 
within the particular industry in which it does business.  
 Chapter 10 examines the next two critical areas considered by D &O underwriters: factors 
particular to the individual cor poration being evaluated, and t he composition and operation of its 
board of directors. 
 Chapter 11 is the first of two chapters that discusses methods of preventing and controlling claims 
against corporate directors and officers. This chapter provides  what can be considered “general” 
methods of loss control.  
2  Chapter 12, the second of two chapters addressing D&O loss cont rol and prevention, focuses on 
corporate governance, explaining how the actual composition and  functioning of a corporate 
board can be improved, which will ultimately reduce a company’s  exposure to claims. 
 Chapter 13 addresses the D&O liability exposures of private com panies as opposed to public 
companies, describes the specific types of claims made against these firms, and explains why 
private companies purch ase D&O insurance. 
 Chapter 14 similarly deals with the exposures of nonprofit orga nizations, the types of claims 
made against nonprofit organizati ons, statutory protections aga inst liability, and underwriting 
considerations.

3 Chapter 1 
The Corporation and the Functions of Directors and Officers 
Overview 
This chapter analyzes the genera l nature of corporations, discu sses the roles that directors and officers 
play within them, and explains the nature of the duties that th ey owe to the corporation. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chap ter you should be able to 
 identify the characteristics of a corporation, 
 distinguish between public and private corporations, 
 identify the functions and responsibilities of corporate direct ors and officers, 
 distinguish between inside and outside directors, and 
 recognize the nature and role  of common board committees. 
What Is a Corporation? 
A corporation is an “artificial person” created under the laws of a given state. This means that a 
corporation has an identity and existence distinct and independ ent from that of its individual owners.  
Corporations have the power to (1) act; (2) contract; (3) sue/b e sued; and (4) own, manage, and buy/sell 
property.  
The profits (and losses) of the corporation are distributed acc ording to the ownership interest (i.e., the 
percentage of total shares) owned by each shareholder.  
The Defining Feature of a Corporati on: Limited Liabili ty of Individual 
Shareholders 
The defining feature of a corpor ation is its legal independence  from the people who create it—meaning 
that if a corporation fails, shareholders only stand to lose th eir investment in the company (i.e., the 
amount of money they paid for shares of stock in the company), but they will not be liable for any 
remaining debts owed to the corporation’s creditors. For exampl e, an investor purchases $100,000 of 
stock in XYZ Company. A year later, XYZ Company declares bankru ptcy. After the bankruptcy court 
liquidates all of XYZ’s assets, it is determined that XYZ still  owes its creditors a total of $5 million. 
Although the investor’s $100,000 investment is now worthless, h e is not liable for any of XYZ’s 
remaining $5 million in debts.  
4 Chartering of Corporations 
Corporations are chartered by all 50 of the United States and b y the federal government in certain 
instances. For example, national banks and thrifts (i.e., savin gs and loan institutions) are federally 
chartered.  
Public versus Private Corporations 
Public corporations are corpora tions whose shares of stock are held by and can be purchased by members 
of the public. In contrast, priva tely held corporations are tho se whose shares the public cannot purchase. 
Rather, the shares of private c ompanies tend to be held by a sm all group of persons who are often, 
although not always, family members. As a result, public compan ies are generally much larger than 
private companies. 
The shares of public companies can be bought or sold on one of the major stock exchanges, such as the 
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the National Association of S ecurities Dealers Automated 
Quotations (NASDAQ). Conversely , the shares of private corporat ions are not traded on any of the major 
stock exchanges because they are  not available for sale to the public. 
The directors and officers of private corporations are exposed to liability for their actions on behalf of the 
corporations they serve. However , the extent of such liability is considerably less than that of persons who 
serve as directors and officers of public corporations. Therefo re, this course will focus on the distinctive 
liability exposure aspects of public —rather than private compan y—directors and officers. However, 
private company and nonprofit directors and officers (D&O) expo sures will also be discussed. 
The Functions of Directors and Officers 
Management of a corporation is entrusted to its board of direct ors, the members of wh ich the shareholders 
elect. The shareholders’ responsib ility for the corporation’s m anagement is limited to (1) electing the 
directors who serve on the board and (2) approving extraordinar y matters put before them by the board, 
such as a proposal to sell the corporation’s assets to another corporation. 
Specific Functions of Corporate Directors 
Corporate directors must ensure that the corporation is managed  in the shareholders’ best interest. The 
directors are responsible for determining the corporation’s bus iness strategy and fo r appointing and 
supervising officers to execute that strategy.  
Corporate Directors: The Link  between Sharehol ders and Manageme nt 
Because they appoint and supervise the corporate officers who c arry out the day-to-day management of 
the corporation, the directors serve as a link between sharehol ders and management. 
Specific Responsibilities 
In supervising the management o f the corporation’s business, di rectors are responsible for the following 
specific items. 
 Establishing and reviewing major policies and procedures 
 Evaluating management’s performance 
 Determining appropriate com pensation for management 
 Identifying and recruiting poten tial board members and manageme nt personnel 
 Reviewing the financial status of the corporation  
5  Preparing and submitting informa tion about the corporation and its financial condition to 
shareholders and government regulators 
 Monitoring and authorizing secu rities (i.e., stock) transaction s, including public offerings of the 
company’s stock 
 Ensuring that the corporation is in compliance with the numerou s federal and state laws and 
regulations that govern various aspects of the corporation’s ac tivities 
Inside versus Outside Directors 
Most publicly traded corporations have a board of directors tha t includes some (but not necessarily all) of 
the corporation’s top executive officers (known as “inside dire ctors”). For example, a corporation’s chief 
executive officer (CEO), chief operating officer (COO), and chi ef financial officer (CFO) are nearly 
always members of the corporatio n’s board of directors. However , the corporation’s chief counsel (i.e., 
chief legal officer) and comptr oller (i.e., chief accounting of ficer), while almost always officers of the 
company, are not always members of its board of directors.  
In addition to these “inside” d irectors are persons who are not  otherwise affiliated with or employed by 
the corporation but may have special qualifications and experti se that is valuable in managing the 
company. Such persons are known as “outside directors.” 
Board Committees 
Boards of directors usually form a handful of what are known as  “committees.” These committees, each 
of which normally consists of two to four members of the board,  are formed for the purpose of addressing 
a particular aspect or feature of the corporation. Like the ent ire board of directors, such committees also 
meet periodically to discuss matters relevant to the particular  subject of their committee. Three of the 
most common board committees and their responsibilities are as follows. 
 Auditing (overseeing the company’s financial, accounting, inter nal, and external audit functions) 
 Nominating (identifying and recruiting new/additional board mem bers and officers) 
 Compensating (recommending appropriate compensation levels for the company’s management, 
as well as compensation for members of the board) 
Other examples of board committe es include those related to cor porate governance, human resources, and 
community/charity purposes.

8 Chapter 2 
Common Law Duties of Directors and Officers 
Overview 
The legal principles enunciated in opinions written by judges a nd issued by the courts (as distinct from 
laws contained in legislative en actments known as statutory law ) are often referred to collectively as 
“case law” or the “common law.” Many of the claims made against  directors and officers are based on 
legal principles embodied in the common law, especially as resp ects the four key duties of (1) loyalty, (2) 
obedience, (3) due care, and (4) good faith, all of which are o wed by directors and officers to the 
corporations they serve. These ar e collectively known as direct ors’ and officers’ “fiduciary duties” and 
are discussed in this chapter.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chap ter you should be able to 
 list the four fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers; 
 recognize the implications of these duties;  
 identify the penalties for br eaching these duties; and 
 determine whether or how directors and officers fiduciary dutie s have been breached, given 
relevant information. 
The Four Fiduciary Duties 
Four of the key fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers  are the duties of loyalty, obedience, due 
care, and good faith. 
The Duty of Loyalty 
According to the Corporate Director’s Guidebook , the duty of loyalty requires that directors and officers 
act with “an undivided and unselfish loyalty to the corporation .” 
Although the courts recognize that there may be a certain degre e of self-interest involved in board 
decisions, the duty of loyalty requires that directors’ self-in terest be minimal and that the interests of the 
corporation and its shareholder s take precedence over the direc tors’ desire to maintain their positions. 
Therefore, directors must ensure that board actions are designe d to benefit the corporation as a whole—
rather than themselves. 
Examples of Breaches of the Duty of Loyalty 
Examples of conduct by directors and officers that has been fou nd to constitute a breach of the duty of 
loyalty are noted in Exhibit 2.1.  
9 Exhibit 2.1 
Breaches of the Duty of Loyalty 
 Revealing inside information or  disclosing trade secrets of the  corporation to 
outsiders  (e.g., advising a stock trad er that the company will be announ cing the 
introduction of a major new dr ug, knowing that the firm’s share  price is likely to rise when 
such information becomes public knowledge) 
 Appropriating a corporate opportunity for personal gain or comp eting with the 
corporation  (e.g., obtaining a “fire sale” price on assets that the corpor ation is selling, 
rather than offering such assets on the open market) 
 Soliciting the corporation’s bus iness or customers after the di rector or officer leaves 
the service of the corporation  (e.g., after retiring from t he board, a direc tor, who by 
means of his or her association with the company, makes sales c alls on behalf of his or her 
own company, to all of  the corporation’s pur chasing managers) 
 Authorizing loans of corporate f unds to themselves or to associ ates on preferential 
terms  (e.g., having a bank director  obtain a home mortgage loan at a  rate that is 3 percent 
below the bank’s regular r ate for that type of loan) 
 Authorizing or receiving improper payments or gratuities from p ersons engaged in 
business transactions with the corporation  (e.g., arranging for the corporation to pay 
bribes to foreign officials as a condition of doing business in  their country). 
 Using corporate assets to entr ench the board in control of the corporation, such as 
where corporate funds are used to purchase stock to maintain a voting majority  
(e.g., convincing the company’s C EO to raise funds for the orga nization by selling shares 
of stock to the company’s direc tors, rather than through a publ ic offering of stock)  
 
Directors and officers who seek to benefit themselves at the co rporation’s expense have breached their 
duty of loyalty to the corporation and may be held personally l iable for any damage suffered by the 
corporation as a result. For example, in Guth v. Loft, Inc.,  5 A.2d 503 (Del. 1939), the president of a 
corporation that manufactured syrups was found to have breached  his duty of loyalty to the corporation 
when he personally  acquired the trademark and formula of Pepsi Cola and a 91 perc ent interest in the 
Pepsi Cola Company by using corporate funds, facilities, and la bor to operate the acquired business. The 
president’s use of corporate assets to personally acquire a cor porate business opportunity violated his duty 
of loyalty to the corporation. 
The Duty of Obedience 
Adherence to the duty of obedience obligates directors to limit  their corporation’s conduct to the powers 
granted by the corporation’s char ter and within the law. “Law” includes not only the common law and 
statutes of the state that a company is incorporated in, but al so federal and state statutes, rules, and 
regulations that control a corporation’s duties and activities.   
Ultra Vires Acts 
Acts that are beyond the powers  conferred upon a corporation by  its charter or by the laws of its state of 
incorporation are termed ultra vires . (A charter is a document filed with the state by the founders  of a 
corporation that describes the purpose, location, and other det ails pertaining to the organization.)  
Directors are not only liable for their own ultra vires  acts, but they are also liable for ultra vires  acts 
authorized by the board as a whole. (For example, if the corpor ation’s charter bans loans to directors and 
officers, the granting of suc h a loan would constitute an ultra vires  act.) Moreover, directors and officers 
do not enjoy immunity simply because their conduct is in the ca pacity as a director or officer; if their  
10 conduct is illegal, they can als o be personally accountable, me aning that their personal assets can be 
appropriated in a lawsuit.  
Personal Exposures to D&O Liability 
Claims against directors and officers for breaching the duty of  obedience have received increased 
attention as the business environment in which they work has ev olved. Historically, these claims have not 
typically implicated the personal assets of the defendant direc tors and officers. In virtually all cases, either 
the company’s insurer or the corporation indemnified the defend ant directors and officers. However, more 
recently, there have been cases wh ere insurance coverage and co rporate indemnification (i.e., the 
corporation paying on the direct or’s behalf for liability the d irector incurred while serving the company) 
were unavailable. In such cases, e specially where the alleged w rongdoing was abnormally egregious, 
directors and officers were forced to personally pay settlement s or judgments from their own assets.  
Important Settlements and Developments 
Directors and officers can no longer feel safe from threats of personal liability expos ure, even under the 
most comprehensive insurance program. As evidenced by many well -publicized settlements, institutional 
plaintiffs (e.g., pension funds , banks) and, in some cases, gov ernment regulators are demanding 
unprecedented personal contributions from directors to settle c ertain large securities claims. In a hallmark 
example, the directors of Enron paid a total of $13 million fro m their own assets, and the directors of 
WorldCom paid a total of $24. 75 million out of their own assets  to claims against them and their 
corporations.  
In other cases, plaintiffs have se ttled with only some of the i ndividual defendant directors/officers for the 
entire amount of the available insurance, thereby leaving the r emaining defendant directors/officers 
uninsured. When combined with the  explosion in the size of clai m settlements in recent years, these 
developments are extre mely alarming, even for the most scrupulo us director or officer. 
The Yates Memo: Individual A ccountability for Corporate Wrongdo ing 
Another development that incr eased the potential liability expo sure for individual directors and officers 
came in the form of a Septembe r 2015 directive from the United States Department of Justice. Released 
under the subject line of “Individual Accountability for Corpor ate Wrongdoing,” but more commonly 
referred to as the Yates Memo, t he directive emphasized the foc us on individual directors and officers 
with regard to corporate misconduct. 
More specifically, the Yates Me mo affords added incentive for a  company to provide the Department of 
Justice with “all relevant fac ts about the individuals involved  in corporate misconduct” in the event of an 
investigation. The Yates Memo incentivizes the release of such information by making it a requirement in 
order for the company that is be ing investigated to be eligible  for any sort of cooperation credit. This 
requirement in turn provides an increased likelihood that indiv idual directors and officers will be involved 
in investigations. 
The Duty of Due Care (Also Known as the Duty of “Due Diligence”) 
The duty of due care requires that directors and officers make decisions based upon reasonably adequate 
information and deliberation.  
What Constitutes “Due Care”? 
Directors and officers must disch arge their duties with the car e that an ordinarily prudent person, in a like 
position, would exercise under sim ilar circumstances and in a m anner they reasonably believe is in the 
best interest of the corporation . The duty of due care also req uires that directors attend board meetings,  
11 obtain and adequately review information concerning actions tak en by the board, and carefully supervise 
the corporation’s business and its major policies.  
The Two Settings Involvi ng the Duty of Due Care 
Director/officer liability for a b reach of the duty to exercise  due care typically arises in one of two 
settings.  
Poor Decision-Making 
With respect to a board decision that leads to a corporate loss , compliance with a director’s duty of due 
care focuses on the good faith  or rationality of the process em ployed in making the challenged board 
decision, not the result of the decision. For instance, Corpora tion A decides to purchase Corporation B. 
The decision was made following extensive discussions at three board meetings and was a product of 500 
hours of analysis by Corporation A’s internal staff. In additio n, the board hired an investment banking 
firm to determine a fair price for the acquisition. If, a year later, it turns out to have been a bad decision 
because Corporation B’s operations are unprofitable, the direct ors will most likely not be held liable for 
violating the duty of due care because they took reasonable mea sures and performed a thorough 
evaluation prior to making the decision to purchase Corporation  B. On the other hand, a decision made 
after one board meeting that invol ved no consultation with outs ide experts would be much more likely to 
result in a perceived violation of the duty of due care.  
Failure To Make a Decision 
With respect to board inaction th at leads to a corporate loss, compliance with a director’s duty of due care 
largely focuses on whether the director attempted in good faith  to assure that the corporation had in place 
an effective information and reporting system to ensure corpora te compliance with legal requirements. 
For instance, assume that Corporation A offered Corporation B a n opportunity to purchase certain assets 
of Corporation A, and Corporati on B did not even bother to eval uate or respond to the offer. In this 
instance, the directors and officers of Corporation B could be held liable for breach ing the duty of due 
care, given their lack of effort  in failing to even review the potential benefits of Corporation B’s offer. 
The Duty of Good Faith 
The fourth common law duty, known as the duty of good faith, ha s emerged and developed more recently 
than the prior three duties di scussed. This duty requires that directors and officers act honestly and 
sincerely in their business dealings with the corporation’s bes t interests in mind. This doctrine was 
advanced in a case known as In re Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litig.,  907 A.2d 693 (Del. Ch. 2005), and 
is discussed later in this course under “A Notable Derivative C laim” in Chapter 8. In this case, the court 
found that, in addition to the three traditional duties, direct ors and officers also have a duty to act in good 
faith. In the court’s opinion, the failure to act in good faith  can create liability for directors and officers in 
conjunction with their service to  the corporation. However, in this case, the judges ultimately ruled that 
despite the plaintiffs’ allegati ons to the contrary, the direct ors and officers had, in fact, acted in good faith 
and were therefore not liable fo r the damages claimed by the pl aintiffs.

A. This answer is incorrect. Honesty is not one of the key common law duties. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The key common law fiduciary duties a re loyalty, obedience, good faith, 
and due care. 
C. That’s correct! The four key com mon law fiduciary duties are lo yalty, obedience, d ue care, and 
good faith. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Honest y is expected of a director, so  it is not one of the common law

2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The duty of due care requires that di rectors and officers discharge their 
duties with the care that an ordi narily prudent person in a lik e position would exercise under 
similar circumstances  and in a manner they  reasonably believe i s in the best interest of the 
corporation. Bill may have believed he was doing the company a favor by efficiently disposing of 
its orphaned autos. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. No evidence has been given that Bill was less than hones t with his fellow 
board members in proposing this bailout offer. 
C. That’s correct! Appropriating a corporate opportunity for perso nal gain or competing with the 
corporation, such as by obtaini ng a fire-sale price on assets t he corporation is selling rather than 
offering such assets on the open market, has been found to cons titute a breach of the duty of 
loyalty. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. There is no evidence that Bill’s cond uct was illegal or that the proposed 
action was outside the board’s authority. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Directors can be held personally liab le for illegal conduct. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The duty of obedience requires compli ance with applicable law, and 
several laws appear to have been breached in this case.

D. This answer is incorr ect. This Act does not exist. The Yates Me mo is the name by which this 
directive is known. 
   
15 5.  
A. That’s correct! The duty of due care requires that directors di scharge their duties with the care that 
an ordinarily prudent person in a  like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a 
manner he or she reasonably believes is in the best interest of  the corporation. Failing to even 
evaluate the offer would violate that duty. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The duty of good faith requires that directors and offi cers act honestly 
and sincerely in their business dealings. Their failure to resp ond did not relate to honesty and 
sincerity. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The dut y of ethical behavior is not o ne of the common law fiduciary

to an offer does not fall within this duty.  
16 Chapter 3 
Federal Securities Liability 
Overview 
Chapter 3 discusses the liability exposures of directors and of ficers under federal securities laws—the 
single greatest exposure faced by directors and officers of pub licly traded corporations. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
 Identify the primary goals and acco mplishments of each of the f ollowing Acts. 
o The Securities Act of 1933 
o The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
o The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 Recognize the directors and officers liability exposures create d by these Acts. 
The Securities Act of 1933 
The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to ensure the avai lability of complete and reliable 
information about securities being sold to the public. The two most important components of the Act are 
Sections 5 and 11.  
Liability under Section 5: The Oblig ation To Register a New Security 
Section 5 makes it illegal to offer or sell securities to the p ublic unless they have firs t been registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For example, if a  corporation seeks to sell stock to the 
public, it must first register the stock with the SEC. The purp ose of this requirement is to assure that the 
corporation and its securities will be evaluated by a neutral p arty that can determine whether the 
corporation is worthy of an investment.  
Liability under Section 11: The Obligati on To Make Truthful  Statements about 
Securities 
Section 11 imposes civil liability for material misstatements i n registration statements. (A “material” 
misstatement refers to a falsifi cation that would have an impac t on a reasonable investor’s judgment of a 
company’s financial position. For  example, intentionally inflat ing a company’s quarterly earnings by 25 
percent would be a material mi sstatement; doing so by 1 percent  would not.) Failure to comply with the 
Act’s technical or substantive requirements in connection with a public offering of stock can result in 
liability of the corporation and its directors and officers. Fo r example, assume that a corporation issues a 
prospectus to induce investors to buy stock in the organization . If it is determined that the prospectus 
contained deliberately false info rmation, the corporation and i ts directors and officers could be held liable 
for violating Section 11 of t he Securities Act of 1933.   
17 The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
In contrast to the Securities Act of 1933, which applies to the  issuance of new shares  of stock in a 
corporation, the Securities Exch ange Act of 1934 was enacted to  protect investors in connection with the 
trading of securities already  issued and outstanding. The primary goal of the Securities Exc hange Act of 
1934 is to ensure that persons involved in securities transacti ons have reasonably equal access to material 
information about the transacti ons and the securities. The most  important components of the Act are 
Section 10(b) and SEC Rule 10(b)–5, known as the anti-fraud provisions.  
Liability under Section 10(b): The Prohi bition against Deceptive Acts/Statements 
This section of the law prohibits manipulative or deceptive act s in connection with the purchase or sale of 
a security. Such provisions would apply in the following situat ion. Assume a corporation issues financial 
statements that materially misre present the true financial cond ition of the company. Such statements 
indicate that the company earned a substantial profit in the ju st-ended fiscal year, yet in reality, it 
sustained a severe loss. As a result of such statements, invest ors claim that they were induced to buy stock 
in the corporation. The shares of  stock plummet in value during  the next month. Under this scenario, the 
corporation and its directors and officers could be held liable  for violating Section 10(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. 
Liability under SEC Rule 10(b)–5: The Prohibition against “Insider Trading” 
This section of the SEC rules applies to what is known as “insi der trading” in the shares of stock in a 
corporation. Insider trading is the trading of a corporation’s stock or other securities, such as bonds, by 
persons with access to nonpublic i nformation (also referred to as asymmetric information ) about the 
company.  
Here is an example of insider trading, which would be prohibite d under SEC Rule 10(b)–5. Assume that a 
corporate director or officer knew that the company was about t o announce a substantial loss for the just-
concluded fiscal quarter. Prior  to a public announcement of the se financial results, the director sold the 
500,000 shares of stock that he owned in the company. This pre- announcement sale allowed the director 
to avoid a considerable persona l loss, given the fact that prio r to the announcement, the company’s stock 
was selling at $30 per share, yet following the disclosure, the  market price plunged to $10 per share.  
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
Following the revelation of massive corporate improprieties, in cluding accounting irregularities, scandals, 
and fraud of unprecedented scale and severity, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. More 
specifically, the Act was a res ponse to the excesses associated  with the Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, and 
Global Crossing bankruptcies (among others), as well as from th e implosion of the stocks in a number of 
high-tech companies during the period of 2000 to 2002.  
The Act addresses several areas of national concern regarding c orporate accounting and auditing, fraud, 
corporate transparency, and officer liability. The most importa nt provisions are noted in Exhibit 3.1.  
18 Exhibit 3.1 
Key Provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 Independent accounting board . The Act created an independent accounting board  to 
oversee corporate accounti ng and auditing practices.  
 Personal certification of financial statements . The Act included a requirement that 
CEOs and CFOs of public companies personally participate  in preparing the firm’s financial 
statements and personally certify the accuracy of such statements.  
 Internal control report . The Act requires that an internal control report  be included in a 
public company’s annual report and  that the company’s public ac countant must attest to 
management’s assessment of the co mpany’s internal control struc tures.  
 Ban on loans . The Act bans corporate loans  to directors and officers, except in certain 
limited circumstances.  
 Insider trading . The Act requires that insider trades (i.e., those by directors and officers) 
be reported to the SEC more quick ly than was previously require d. 
 Audit committee reform . The Act requires that audit committees  be composed entirely of 
independent  directors and that members o f audit committees be experienced and well 
versed on financial issues.  
 Penalties for material misstatements . The Act requires CEOs and CFOs to forfeit bonus 
and equity compensation  in the event of a material restatement of a company’s financia l 
statements. (A financial restatem ent is issued when a corporati on must provide to the 
public and the SEC a completel y new set of financial data becau se there has been a 
substantial error in the original statements.)  
 Whistleblower protection.  The Act provides for criminal penalties against corporations 
that retaliate against whistleblow ers who reveal conduct by off icials at the company. Such 
penalties apply regardless of whether the company’s stock is pu blicly traded. 
   
19 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Pr otection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed 
into federal law in response to the United States recession, wh ich took place from late 2007 through mid-
2009. As stated in the law itself, the chief goals of the legis lation include promoting financial stability by 
improving accountability and transparency, ending “too big to f ail” treatment of banks, ending bank and 
corporate bailouts, and protecti ng consumers from abusive finan cial services practices. Exhibit 3.2 shows 
each of the sixteen Titles contai ned within Dodd-Frank, the nam es of which provide a glimpse of the 
range of issues that are addressed in more detail within the Ac t.

As reported by K. Alan Parry and E ric G. Barber for the America n Bar Association (“Dodd-Frank’s 
Impact on D&O Insurance,” November/December 2011), the Act’s wh istleblower “bounty” provision and 
executive compensation “claw-bac k” provision are each particula rly noteworthy in terms of their impact 
on directors and officers liability.  
Dodd-Frank effectively incentivized corporate whistleblowing ac tivity by amending the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and providing for monetary awards for whis tleblowers who provide information to 
the SEC that results in successful enforcement actions. By prov iding this potential “bounty” for those 
who report corporate wrongdoings, the Act increased director an d officer exposure to liability 
significantly. In the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower report released in November 2015 (“The 2015 
Annual Report to Congress: Dodd-Fr ank Whistleblower Program”), it was noted that the number of 
whistleblower reports to the agency had increased every year si nce the program’s inception in 2011. As  
20 reported by Alan Farnham of ABC News in September 2012 (“7 Rich est Snitches: Time to Rat Out Your 
Boss?”), companies like UBS, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Bank of America have all been involved in 
whistleblower lawsuits that r esulted in multi-million dollar re wards for the employee whistleblowers.  
The executive compensation “claw-b ack” provision, a provision t hat expands the range of potential 
scenarios in which a director or officer would be required to f orfeit incentive-based compensation that 
was earned based on erroneous f inancial filings, also increased  liability exposure. The provision 
encompasses (a) any current or fo rmer executive; (b) a 3-year c law-back period predating financial 
restatements; and (c) strict liability, as opposed to liability  only for misconduct. Each of the preceding 
aspects constitute a broadening of  application (and therefore a n increased exposure) compared to similar 
claw-back provisions that were p reviously included in the Sarba nes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  
 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993

Liability for Anticompetitive and Unfair Business Practices 
The federal prohibition against anticompetitive business practi ces is principally embodied in two 
“antitrust” statutes—the Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman) and th e Clayton Antitrust Act (Clayton)—
violations of which can subject corporate directors and officer s to liability. Sherman prohibits contracts, 
combinations (i.e., groups of c ompanies, also sometimes referre d to as cartels), and conspiracies in 
restraint of trade, monopolies, a nd attempts and conspiracies t o monopolize. Clayton prohibits price 
discrimination among purchasers of goods, exclusive dealing arr angements, and corporate mergers and 
acquisitions that may substan tially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of 
commerce. Notably, the medical s ector has a significant antitru st exposure. 
Predatory Price-Cutting Activities  
The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 imposes both civil and criminal  penalties for predatory price-cutting 
and other actions taken to eliminate competition. The Federal T rade Commission Act of 1914 also 
prohibits other unfair or deceptive methods of competition.  
Disclosure of Trade Secrets  
Common law and federal statutes protect trade secrets. The Unif orm Trade Secrets Act codifies common 
law principles of liability for improper disclosure of trade se crets. This Act prohibits misappropriation of 
confidential business or technological information by any means , including hiring another company’s 
employee with the expectation that the employee will divulge or  use the trade secrets of the former 
company in his or her new position.  
Liability for Copyright/Patent/Trademark Infringement 
Federal registration requirement s protect owners of copyrights,  patents, and trademarks from 
infringement by others.  
27 Copyright/Patent Infringement 
The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to reproduce t he work, prepare derivative (i.e., similar) 
works, distribute copies of the w ork, and perform and display t he work. Violation of such rights may 
result in liability for infringement. Similarly, anyone who mak es, uses, or sells a patented product without 
authorization from the patent holder may be held liable in dama ges for infringement of the patent. 
Trademark Infringement 
Federal (i.e., the Lanham Act) a nd state statutes and common la w protect trademarks from unauthorized 
use. A trademark is infringed upon when there is a likelihood o f confusion between two products caused 
by similar marks, such that a t ypical consumer exercising ordin ary caution would think that the products 
derive from the same source.  
To illustrate, a director or offi cer may be held personally lia ble for patent, copyright, or trademark 
infringement by a corporation. For example, in a patent infring ement suit brought in 2004, Bennett 
Marine, Inc. v. Lenco Marine, Inc., et al , (Florida Southern District Court, Case No. 0:04-cv-60326), th e 
court found Lenco Marine’s presi dent personally liable for the company’s infringement, making him 
responsible for nearly $340,000 in damages jointly and severall y with the company itself. Although the 
case was successfully appealed by Lenco in 2013, this example s till illustrates the court’s willingness to 
impose personal liability in certain cases of infringement.  
Liability for Racketeering Activities 
The Racketeer Influenced and Corru pt Organizations (RICO) Act p rohibits any person, including 
corporations and their individual directors and officers, from conducting the affairs of any enterprise 
through a “pattern of racketeer ing activity” or from acquiring an enterprise through conduct constituting 
such activity. A “pattern of r acketeering activity” is establis hed by showing the commission of at least 
two enumerated acts within a 10-year period. Examples of acts t hat would constitute racketeering include 
securities fraud; mail fraud; bankruptcy fraud; obstruction of justice; and embezzlement from pension, 
welfare, and union funds, among others. 
Treble Damage Provisions  
In addition to its criminal penalties, RICO creates a civil cau se of action that enables a person injured by a 
RICO violation to recover treble damages as well as costs and a ttorney fees. For example, if a plaintiff 
suffered $1 million in losses that qualified as a “pattern of r acketeering,” under the treble damages 
provision, he or she could potentially collect three times this  amount—$3 million. 
Liability for Mismanagement of Investment Company Funds 
The Investment Company Act of 1940 protects holders of shares i n investment companies (i.e., 
corporations formed to invest in the securities of other corpor ations, such as mutual funds) by imposing 
fiduciary duties on the managers and advisers of investment com panies. Investment companies are 
organized and managed by an investment adviser that provides se rvices to the company in exchange for 
fees. This Act imposes a fiduciary duty on both the investment adviser and the investment company, 
requiring that they charge reasonable compensation for their se rvices. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) and mutual fund shareholders may sue investmen t company directors for damages if 
they breach this duty by charging excessive fees.  
Liability for Mismanagement of Employee Benefit Plans 
“Fiduciaries” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act  (ERISA) of 1974 are defined as “any 
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control wit h respect to the management or  
28 administration of the plan or its assets.” In this instance, “t he plan” refers to employee benefit programs 
such as pension plans, 401(k) programs, or group health insuran ce coverage offered by an employer. 
Directors and officers, even though they may have no day-to-day  responsibilities for managing employee 
benefit programs, can be held lia ble for mismanagement of such plans. The bases for asserting liability 
are that directors/officers (1) negligently selected the fiduci aries who do have that responsibility and (2) 
had an ongoing responsibility to monitor the fiduciaries they s elected, which they failed to do. So-called 
ERISA stock-drop litigation (discussed later in this course) is  an example of the claims to which directors 
and officers are subject to in conjunction with employee benefi t programs.  
Liability for Failure To Coll ect and Remit Payroll Taxes 
The Internal Revenue Code (the Code) requires employers to with hold federal income and social security 
taxes from their employees’ wages. The Code imposes personal li ability on “responsible persons” if the 
business does not collect or pay over these taxes to the Intern al Revenue Service. Most cases against 
individual directors and officers turn on whether such individu al is a “responsible person” under the 
Code—usually defined as someone  who has significant control ove r the company’s finances.  
Liability for Safety Violations 
Under certain circumstances, directors and officers may be held  liable, as “employers,” for violations of 
the Occupational Safety and Hea lth Act of 1970 (OSH Act). The O SH Act imposes two important duties 
on “employers.” First, employers have a general duty to provide  a working environment that is free from 
hazards likely to cause serious h arm, or even death, to employe es. Second, employers must comply with 
specific occupational safety and health standards promulgated u nder the OSH Act.  
In April of 2016, Don Blankenship , the former Massey Energy Com pany CEO, was convicted of willfully 
conspiring to violate federal saf ety standards, which led to th e death of 29 coal miners at Massey 
Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine  in 2010. Situations like this, e specially in similar industries with 
increased hazards, exemplify the v ast extent of liability that can be inherent in safety violations. 
Environmental Liability 
Another area of potential liability for corporate directors and  officers relates to compliance with 
increasingly comprehensive environmental laws. Corporations hav e long been held liable for improper 
dispersal, handling, or disposal o f materials harmful to the en vironment. Now, directors and officers may 
also be subject to personal liability. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Respon se, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA)  
CERCLA affects owners or operato rs of facilities that have rele ased hazardous substances into the 
environment. Also known as the Superfund Act, CERCLA establishe s the means by which the 
government and private parties may bring suit to recover cleanu p costs from those responsible for 
environmental damage. In United States v. Northeastern Pharm. & Chem. Co., 810 F.2d 726 (8th Cir. 
Mo. 1986), cert. denied , 484 U.S. 848 (1987), the Eighth Circuit found individual offi cers liable for a 
corporation’s release of polluta nts where the officers had the power to control and direct the disposal of 
the pollutants. The individuals were held personally liable for  cleanup costs not because of their status as 
corporate officers, but because of their personal involvement w ith the CERCLA violations, including the 
arrangement for transportation a nd disposal of hazardous substa nces on behalf of the corporation. 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 
RCRA establishes a comprehensive hazardous waste management sys tem. This Act imposes “cradle to 
grave” regulation over the generation, transportation, and disp osal of hazardous waste. Therefore, owners  
29 and operators that treat, store , and dispose of hazardous waste  must keep and maintain detailed records 
regarding handling of the waste . The government may institute c riminal actions for violations of this law, 
and both the government and private citizens may bring civil ac tions. 
Liability in Connection wi th Government Contracts 
In 1986, the False Claims Act was amended to create a new direc tors and officers (D&O) exposure for 
treble damages in claims against directors and officers, as wel l as permit private citizens to bring what are 
known as qui tam suits on behalf o f the U.S. government against  anyone defrauding the  U.S. government. 
Additionally, the 1986 amendments  provide for (1) the reimburse ment to the private citizen of reasonable 
attorney fees and costs and (2) the guaranteed payment to the p rivate citizen of at least 15 percent of any 
judgment or settlement recovered by the government if the Depar tment of Justice (DOJ) participates in 
the case (or 25–30 percent if the DOJ does not participate).  
This Act was further amended in 2009, by the enactment of the F raud Enforcement and Recovery Act, 
and in 2010, due to changes brought about by the Patient Protec tion and Affordable Care Act. These sets 
of changes had the general effect  of expanding potential liabil ity, broadening the definition of “claim,” 
and further equipping plaintiffs  to overcome potential dismissa ls in court. 
Any company doing business (or ev en loosely associated) with th e U.S. government has potential 
exposure under the Act. Case in point, in March 2016, a multist ate oncology firm agreed to pay upwards 
of $34 million to settle a qui t am suit brought by a former phy sicist who alleged that the company had 
defrauded the Medicare trust f und and taxpayers by utilizing a Gamma test that physicians were not 
properly trained to interpret. 
Liability in Connection with Bribery of Foreign Officials 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 imposes criminal liab ility on directors and officers for illegal 
payments to foreign officials. F or example, the Minister of Tra de in Country A may demand an annual 
$50,000 payment from Corporation X in return for allowing Corpo ration X to ship its products into 
Country A. In the 1970s, an SEC investigation uncovered about 4 00 companies that had paid a combined 
$300 million on foreign bribes, with Lockheed Aircraft Corporat ion amongst the biggest offenders 
(Whistleblower Justice Network, “Birth of the FCPA: This Briber y is Positively Bananas”). 
The law also mandates that corporations maintain detailed recor ds of payments to foreign officials. 
Accordingly, courts have held d irectors and officers liable for  the corporation’s failure to properly 
maintain such records.  
The Walmart Case 
In April 2012, The New York Times reported that a former Walmart executive alleged  that the firm had 
paid millions of dollars to Mexican government officials in ret urn for expediting the opening of new 
stores there ("With Wal-Mart Claims, Greater Attention on a Law ," April 25, 2012). Although an internal 
investigation at Walmart was ongoi ng, a derivative claim was fi led, which sought monetary damages, 
along with changes in the company 's management controls and cor porate governance procedures. The 
United States District Court for the Western District of Arkans as dismissed the claim in March of 2015. 
Liability in Connection with Employment Laws 
Employment-related claims are one of the fastest growing areas of litigation and an increasing source of 
claims against corporate directors and officers. Such claims in clude allegations that directors and officers 
violated laws prohibiting discrimination, wrongful termination,  sexual harassment, retaliation, and other 
employment-specific acts. Employ ment-related claims do, however , constitute a much smaller exposure 
from a severity standpoint, comprising a far lower amount than,  for example, claims alleging financial 
misconduct or acts involving mergers and acquisitions.   
30 Coverage for Employment-Related Claims under Stand-Alone Policies 
Employment-related claims are e xcluded under the vast majority of directors and officers liability policy 
forms. Therefore, most corpora tions purchase coverage for this exposure under either stand-alone 
employment practices liability (EPLI) policies or by means of w hat are known as management liability 
package policies. The latter po licies cover employment-related exposures within a separate insuring 
agreement and also contain separ ate insuring agreements for dir ectors and officers and fiduciary liability 
exposures, and sometimes for cybe r and privacy claims. Accordin gly, this course will not examine 
employment-related director/officer claim exposures in detail, since these types of claims are more often 
covered by EPLI rather than D&O liability policy forms. For mor e information on employment-related 
claims, refer to the “Employm ent Practices Liability Exposures and Insurance Coverage” course within 
the MLIS program, which treats this subject in depth.

Primary Defenses to Directors and Officers and Corporate Liability 
Overview 
Chapter 5 sets forth the most com mon defenses whe n claims are m ade against directors and officers. 
These defenses can often reduce th e extent of their liability a nd, depending upon the circumstances, 
completely absolve them of liability for damages sought by a pl aintiff. These defenses include detailed, 
accurate minutes of board meetings; the business judgment rule;  dissent; reliance; and ratification.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize defenses a director can  employ when charged with dire ctors and officers (D&O) 
claims; 
 recognize the effect of the business judgment rule; and 
 identify preemptive steps a dir ector or officer can take to pre vent and/or defend against potential 
D&O claims, given appropriate information. 
The Importance of Minutes at Board Meetings 
The best defense to any claim of wrongdoing is that the directo r or officer did nothing wrong. 
Performance of a director’s thr ee basic duties of diligence, lo yalty, and obedience w ill generally avoid 
claims of wrongdoing. To establis h such performance, the direct ors will frequently need documentation 
or other proof of what was done, c onsidered, reviewed, or rejec ted at board meetings. Accordingly, 
properly kept corporate minutes—doc uments that record the event s taking place at board meetings—have 
high value. The careful, accurat e, and complete preparation of such minutes can provide effective 
defenses against allegations of liability. On the other hand, b oard minutes that do not disclose what the 
directors knew or actually did are of little defensive value.  
The Business Judgment Rule 
The business judgment rule is a ru le of evidence that is used a s a defense when claims are made against 
corporate directors and officers. It creates a presumption that  when the directors and officers made a 
business decision, they acted on an informed basis, in good fai th, within their authority, and with the 
honest belief that the action taken was in the best interest of  the company.  
   
35 The Essence of the Business Judgment Rule: The Decision-Making Process  
In a 2005 decision made in respon se to a claim against the dire ctors and officers of the Walt Disney 
Company, the Delaware Chancery Court reaffirmed the court’s rel uctance to question corporate decisions 
in the absence of obvious malfeasance when it stated the follow ing. 
… Should the Court apportion liability based on the ultimate outcome (emphasis added) of 
decisions taken in good faith by faithful directors or officers , those decision-makers would 
necessarily take decisions that minimized risk, not maximized v alue. The entire advantage 
of the risk-taking, innovative, w ealth-creating engine that is the Delaware corporation 
would cease to exist, with disastrous results for shareholders and society alike.…  
As evidenced by the court’s statement, the essence of the busin ess judgment rule is its attempt to 
encourage informed risk-taking by  persons in charge of a corpor ation. Thus, unless it can be shown that 
the directors and officers clearly failed to exercise reasonabl e due diligence, they will generally not be 
held liable for the outcomes—even  if unfavorable—of their decis ions. 
Preconditions for the Busi ness Judgment Rule To Apply 
Five preconditions must be present for the business judgment ru le to be applicable and, thus, absolve 
directors and officers in the event it is alleged that a decisi on they made caused a loss to the corporation 
or to one or more shareholders . These preconditions are as foll ows. 
 The directors made a business decision (i.e., the rule does not apply where directors either 
abdicate their functions or simply fail to act). 
 The directors were disinterested  (i.e., they had no personal stake) in the transaction or subje ct 
matter being decided. 
 The directors were informed  in making their decision. 
 The directors acted in good faith . 
 The directors’ conduct was not an abuse of discretion .  
Smith v. Van Gorkom: When the Bu siness Judgment Rule Did Not Apply 
The case of Smith v. Van Gorkom , 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985), which was decided by the Delaware 
Supreme Court and also referred to as the TransUnion Case, prov ides a counter-example to the above-
noted case study. The importance of the case lies in the fact t hat it offers a real-world illustration in which 
a court found that the business judgment rule did not apply to a decision made by a corporate board of 
directors.  
The case involved a leveraged buyout of TransUnion by the Marmo n Group, in which TransUnion’s 
CEO, Jerome Van Gorkom, request ed a per-share price of $55 for the company. However, in arriving at 
this price, Mr. Van Gorkom consu lted only with TransUnion’s CFO . In addition, during a 2-hour 
meeting, at which the offer was discussed, TransUnion’s board o f directors was not presented with any 
documents that explained the transaction and also did not recei ve a calculation as to how the valuation of 
the company was arrived at. (The merger was approved at a secon d board meeting.)  
In a subsequent lawsuit brought by the plaintiff (Smith), who o bjected to the transaction, the Delaware 
Supreme Court ruled that the boa rd had violated its duty of due  care. The Court concluded that based on 
the CEO’s failure to engage expert advice as to the organizatio n’s value, coupled with the board’s hasty 
and less-than-fully-informed appr oval of the transaction, board  members were therefore not entitled to the 
protection afforded by the busin ess judgment rule in absolving it of liability for ratifying the merger.  
36 Dissent 
A director present at a board meeting usually will be presumed to have voted in favor of the board’s 
action unless his or her dissent from the action is recorded in  the minutes or is filed with the corporate 
secretary either during the meeting or within a reasonable time  after its adjournment. On the other hand, 
absence from a meeting or abstaining from voting is generally n ot recognized as a defense.  
If a director is uncomfortable with a board decision, the direc tor should affirmatively dissent (if at the 
meeting) or express a dissent at the next meeting (if absent fr om the first meeting) and should be sure the 
dissent is recorded in the board minutes by name.  
Reliance 
Reliance upon qualified persons, s uch as officers, experts, con sultants, board committees, and legal 
counsel, may be a defense if the  reliance is in good faith and with the proper degree of care. In performing 
their duties, directors may rely on information, opinions, repo rts, or statements, including financial 
statements and other financial d ata prepared or presented by of ficers or employees of the corporation, 
legal counsel, public accountant s, or other professionals, or a  committee of the board. In relying on such 
sources, directors must act in go od faith. However, they will n ot be considered to be acting in good faith 
if they have knowledge that woul d cause their reliance to be un warranted. (For example, if they have 
knowledge that the conclusions of an expert, in his report, are  erroneous, the directors and officers cannot 
rely on that report.) Moreover, directors may not abdicate thei r responsibilities and seek exoneration from 
liability merely by delegating au thority to board committees or  subordinates. 
Ratification 
Ratification by shareholders of board decisions, if made with f ull disclosure, may constitute a defense to 
an action against the directors. (For example, ratification may  involve a vote by shareholders to accept a 
buy-out offer from another corporation at a specific price per share.)

A. demonstrating bias on the part of Noah’s accusers. 
B. demonstrating malicious intent on the part of his accusers. 
C. pleading guilty and accepting the consequences. 
D. proving that he did nothing wrong. 
2. At a Magazine Corporation board meeting, outside director Bill Board strenuously protested a 
decision to do something that he considered illegal and unethic al. However, he was overruled. 
Subsequently, the entire board is sued for breaching its duty o f obedience. Bill Board can best 
prove he has done nothing wrong 
A. by disputing the corporate minutes of the board meeting. 
B. by establishing that the other directors exercised bad business  judgment. 
C. if careful, complete, and accurate corporate minutes have been kept. 
D. if the duration of the relevant board meeting was accurately re corded in hours and 
minutes. 
3. For months, the Barrier Corporation board had been exploring a proposal to move the company’s 
manufacturing operation to Mexico. Some directors raised a conc ern that the tax treatment of 
offshore operations could become less favorable depending on th e outcome of an upcoming 
national election. The directors discussed this concern at leng th and decided to accept the risks 
and proceed with the move. Less than a year later, a new admini stration took office and Barrier 
was penalized for its decision. In applying the business judgme nt rule to this situation, a court 
will likely find that 
A. The Barrier board exercised due j udgment despite the unfavorabl e outcome of its 
decision. 
B. The Barrier board failed to exe rcise due judgment by underestim ating the risks its 
decision involved. 
C. The Barrier board should have delayed acting on the offshoring proposal until after the 
election’s results were known. 
D. The unfavorable outcome of its decision is ample evidence that the Barrier board acted 
inappropriately. 
   
38 4. One of the directors at a Goldfish Corporation board meeting pr oposed that Goldfish purchase 
Guppy Company, a smaller company in the same industry that had just begun looking for a buyer. 
Another director immediately seconded the motion, and the purch ase was approved without 
further discussion. After completing the deal, Goldfish discove red that it had also acquired 
Guppy’s sizable debt. If a Goldfi sh shareholder makes a complai nt against the board, a court is 
likely to find that the boa rd violated its duty of 
A. due care. 
B. good faith. 
C. loyalty. 
D. obedience. 
5. Bagel Bakery, Inc., finds it difficult to meet retailers’ incre asing demand for its product with its 
present baking facility, so corporate officers present a plan t o increase capacity by buying another 
building and opening a second bake ry. Most board members are in  favor of the growth plan. 
Director Ida Noh, however, believes Bagel should instead raise its prices to maximize profits and 
limit demand to the capacity of its current facility. As a boar d member, she is concerned that she 
could be held accountable for contributing to a bad decision if  the proposal is acted upon. The 
best way for Ida to defend hersel f against any such allegations  is to 
A. attend the meeting but abstain from voting on the proposal. 
B. insist that minutes explicitly sta te that Ida Noh voted against  the proposal. 
C. raise her hand and politely say “nay” when the vote is taken. 
D. stay away from the meeting at w hich the board will vote on the proposal.  
39 Answers to Chapter 5 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorr ect. This defense doe s not address the que stion whether the accusers’ claims 
are valid. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Noah c annot vindicate himself by blam ing his accusers. 
C. This answer is incorrect. An admission of wrongdoing is not a d efense, but it might be the best 
strategy if Noah is guilty of the charges. 
D. That’s correct! The best defense  to any claim of wrongdoing is that the director or officer did 
nothing wrong. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. If the  minutes accurately reflect Bil l’s position, there is no need for a 
dispute. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Bill’s objective should be to establi sh his own good judgment. 
C. That’s correct! Complete and accu rate minutes woul d record not only the board’s final decision, 
but also the directors’ personal positions relative to the deci sion. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Minutes of a board meeting should rec ord the events that take place at a 
meeting as well as the opening and closing time of the formal m eeting. 
3.  
A. That’s correct! The business judgment rule attempts to encourag e informed risk-taking. Unless it 
can be shown that the directors clearly failed to exercise reas onable due diligence, they will 
generally not be held liable for the outcomes—even if unfavorab le—of their decisions. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The board identified the concern and discussed it at length. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The co urt is unlikely to second-guess  the decision to proceed on a timely 
basis. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Any decision that involves risks face s the possibility of an unfavorable 
outcome, but that does not necessarily make it a bad decision. 
4.  
A. That’s correct! As in Smith v. Van Gorkom, the court is likely to conclude that the Goldfish board 
was not entitled to the protection afforded by the business jud gment rule due to the board’s hasty 
and uninformed approval of the transaction. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Though uninformed, the Goldfish board  may have had the corporation’s 
best interests in mind. 
C. This answer is incorrect. No evidence was given that the Goldfi sh directors failed to act with an 
undivided and unselfish loyalty to the corporation. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The Goldfish board presumably had aut hority to approve the acquisition. 
   
40 5.  
A. This answer is inco rrect. If Ida is opposed to the proposition,  she should vote against it, not 
abstain. 
B. That’s correct! A director is us ually presumed to have voted in  favor of a board action unless his 
or her dissent is recorded by name in the minutes or promptly r ecorded soon thereafter. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Voting against the proposal is a good  first step, but it will serve as a 
defense only if Ida’s vote is r ecorded by name i n the meeting’s  records. 
D. This answer is incorrect. By absenting herself from the meeting  at which she could have cast an 
opposing vote, Ida would, in eff ect, contribute to what she con siders a bad decision.

Securities Class Action Claims 
Overview 
Securities class actions are, by far, the type of claim in whic h the largest amount of damages is asserted 
against and paid by public company directors and officers. This  chapter will describe the nature of these 
claims.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter you should be able to do the foll owing. 
 Distinguish between securities cl ass action claims and other ty pes of claims. 
 Recognize factors that trigger securities class action claims. 
 Identify legislation aimed at r educing or controlling class act ion abuses. 
 Summarize relevant data concerning class action claims. 
What Are Securities Class Action Claims? 
Securities class action claims are brought by a publicly held c orporation’s shareholders. They are claims 
in which a large group of people collectively bring a claim to court. Such claims allege that specific 
actions (stated in lawsuit papers as “allegations”) by a firm’s  directors and officers caused a loss in 
market value of the firm’s securities.  
Advantages of Class Acti on for Plaintiffs  
Whenever more than a single pers on or organization suffers a lo ss associated with the acts of a 
corporation’s directors and officers, there is a strong likelih ood that they will file the ir claim in the form 
of a class action. The advantages of class action claims, from the standpoint of a plaintiff, include the fact 
that they (1) increase the effici ency of the legal process beca use they bring together many plaintiffs, all of 
whom have alleged the same wr ongdoings, against the same person s/organizations; (2) lower the cost of 
litigation (on a per-defendant b asis); and (3) provide incentiv e for people to seek legal redress in 
situations where their damages would otherwise have been too sm all to have brought a lawsuit. For 
example, an investor whose shares lost $10,000 in value probabl y could not find a lawyer to represent 
him or her. However, if 1,000 investors with similar losses ban ded together to file a class action, it would 
be easier to secure legal representation as a “class.” 
What Triggers a Securities Class Action Claim? 
The immediate cause of most class action claims is the release to the public of nega tive financial data 
pertaining to a corporation’s operations. These releases then p roduce heavy selling of the company’s 
stock, which, in turn, causes a precipitous drop in the share p rice, ultimately resulting in a loss that is 
sustained by the organization’s stockholders.   
42 Securities Class Action Clai ms: A Typical Scenario 
The following scenario depicts a t ypical sequence of events lea ding up to a securities class action claim. 
Assume that securities analysts h ave estimated that the XYZ Cor poration will earn $2 per share during the 
quarter ending on March 31, 2016 . When XYZ reports its actual e arnings to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) on April 21, instead of a $2 per share profit,  it reveals a loss of $1 per share. This 
announcement of an “earnings miss” causes the company’s share p rice to drop from $42 to $28 that day. 
As a result, a group of XYZ’s s hareholders file a class action lawsuit. The sharehol ders allege that the 
company’s directors and officers have mismanaged the firm, a fa ct that is responsible for the $1 per share 
earnings loss. Based on the fact that 50 million shares of stoc k are outstanding, the lawsuit alleges a loss 
of $700 million, which represents  the diminution in market valu e of all outstanding shares (50 million x 
$14 ($42 – $28)). Given this calculation, the magnitude of dama ges claimed in securities litigation 
becomes apparent. The damages computed here are quite typical o f those claimed in class action claims 
involving the shares of large publicly traded companies. 
What Specific Actions Give Rise to Securities Class Action Claims? 
The immediate trigger  to most securities class action claims is a precipitous drop i n a firm’s stock price, 
as illustrated above. However, it is important to understand th at securities class actions are the legal form  
in which many claims, and by far the largest  ones, are made against corporate directors and officers, 
rather than the cause of action  (i.e., the specific action or c ircumstance that gives rise to the claim). 
Chapter 7 of this course lists and describes five specific circ umstances that most commonly give rise to 
securities class action claims.  
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act: Reducing Class Ac tion 
Abuses 
The Private Securities Litigati on Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995 wa s intended to elimi nate many of the 
abusive practices associated with  securities class action lawsu its. As will be explained below, starting 
around 1990, a number of plaintiffs ’ lawyers began devising and  using highly questionable methods of 
bringing securities class action claims against major corporati ons.  
Anatomy of a “Shakedown”: How Many  Class Action Lawsuits Originated 
Among the most prominent of such abuses involved securities cla ss action lawsuits instigated by a 
handful of law firms—most notably  the law firm of Milberg Weiss . Such firms arranged for various 
individuals (often referred to as “professional plaintiffs”) to  purchase small amounts of shares in a 
number of large, publicly traded corporations. The firms then s et up special departments that closely 
tracked the hour-by-hour fluctuations in the share prices of th ese companies’ stocks. Whenever a share 
price dropped significantly (e.g., more than 10 percent) during  a short period of time (e.g., less than a 
week), the professional plainti ffs brought securities class act ion lawsuits against the directors and officers 
of the affected corporations. The  plaintiffs asserted that spec ific acts of the directors and officers caused 
the stocks of these companies to  lose value, a loss that was ul timately sustained by the company’s 
shareholders.  
The essence of the scheme was to quickly bring suit immediately  after a drop in a company’s stock. This 
is because the individual who was first to file such a securiti es class action lawsuit was designated as the 
“lead plaintiff,” and the law firm  representing the lead plaint iff was legally entitled to represent the entire 
“class” of shareholders in the claim. This ruse allowed Milberg  Weiss to collect huge fees when claims 
were settled against major cor porations, despite the fact that its group of professional plaintiffs 
represented a tiny fraction of the  corporations’ actual shareho lders. 
Eventually, it was revealed that Milberg Weiss illegally paid s ignificant sums to certain individuals to 
serve as “professional plaintiffs” so that Milberg Weiss would have the “inside track” in being able to  
43 serve as lead counsel when a class action claim was brought. Se veral former partners in the firm received 
jail sentences for their offenses. 
Specific PSLRA Reforms 
The most important change implemented by the PSLRA was that it limited the frequency with which 
“professional plaintiffs” could serve as “lead plaintiff” to no  more than 5 times in 3 years. The law also 
placed restrictions on the extent to which law firms that were the first to file claims received the right to 
represent the entire class of sha reholders merely because they won the so-called race to the courthouse, as 
the Milberg Weiss law firm so often did.  
Results of PSLRA 
Unfortunately, abuses associated with securities class action l awsuits still remain. Furthermore, the 
PSLRA has generally not reduced  either the long-term frequency or severity of such claims. Rather, it has 
unexpectedly produced even higher  settlement amounts  in securities class action claims. 
The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005: Another Attempt To Contr ol 
Class Actions 
The Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) of 2005, which expanded fe deral jurisdiction over securities and 
other class action lawsuits, rep resented a second attempt to co ntrol the abuses associ ated with these types 
of claims. Business groups and tort reform advocates lobbied fo r the legislation, asserting that it was 
essential to prevent class action lawsuit abuse. 
Goals of CAFA 
CAFA attempted to achieve three key goals, as discussed below.  
Reduction in the Number of Claims 
By requiring most class actions to be heard in federal rather t han state courts, CAFA advocates foresaw a 
reduction in the number of secur ities class actions. This is be cause federal courts have historically been 
much more stringent than state courts in granting plaintiffs’ c lass certification motions.  
Reduction of Forum Shopping  
Proponents of CAFA argue that in certain problematic jurisdicti ons, juries were accustomed to awarding 
astronomical sums that far exceeded actual damages.  
Greater Federal Scrut iny over Settlements 
CAFA advocates sought to reign in w hat they considered the exce ssive fees often garnered by plaintiff’s 
attorneys. In some cases, these fees exceeded the amount of the  actual monetary relief received by the 
class action plaintiffs themselves.  
Basic Provisions 
CAFA gives federal courts, rathe r than state courts, jurisdicti on over certain class actions. 
 in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million 
 where any of the members of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any 
defendant 
The practical effect of these pr ovisions was that as a result o f CAFA’s enactment, the vast majority of 
securities class action claims are now tried in federal, rather  than state, courts. This is because virtually all 
such claims involve damages fa r exceeding $5 million, and becau se it is rare for such claims not to  
44 involve at least one plaintiff whose state of residence differs  from the state of incorporation of the 
corporation being sued.  
CAFA also contains a provision giving courts greater scrutiny o ver class action settlements, especially 
coupon settlements. This provision was important because prior to CAFA, many settlements resulted in 
the distribution of product “coupons,” entitling plaintiffs to receive free merchandise produced by the 
corporation being sued rather than cash. In contrast, the attor neys who brought such claims received 
substantial cash fees. For example, there have been incidences where the attorneys’ fees exceeded the 
monetary award to class members. The class members actually los t money because their attorney’s fees 
were paid from the monies the plaintiffs received from the sett lement! (Coupons are not prohibited as a 
result of CAFA, although it does indicate that the value of suc h coupons must be reasonable, given the 
facts of the case and the losses sustained by the investors.) 
Impact 
As reported in April 2008 by the Federal Judicial Center, in th e last of four interim reports on CAFA’s 
impact, the Act quickly resulted in a 72 percent increase in cl ass action activity at the district court level 
(“Impact of CAFA on the Federal Courts: Fourth Interim Report,”  Federal Judicial Center, April 2008). 
Moreover, online legal solution provider WORLD Law Direct has r eported that many plaintiffs now 
attempt to engage in forum shoppi ng at the federal circuit leve l by asking courts to “apply the laws of a 
single state to a diversity class action lawsuit” (“Class Actio n Fairness Act’s Impact Internationally,” 
Daniela Levett). Additionally, pla intiffs have utilized creativ e “class splitting” methods to remain at the 
state level, thereby countering some of CAFA’s intended effects . 
The years following the above re ports have continued to highlig ht the difficulty of limiting securities 
class actions. According to a January 2016 report from NERA Eco nomic Consulting titled “Recent 
Trends in Securities Class Action Litigation: 2015 Full-Year Re view,” securities class action lawsuit 
filings in 2015 reached their  highest level since 2008.  
Securities Class Action Claim Data 
This section provides a brief r ecap of securities class action claim and settlement data since 1997. 
The Correlation between Claim Fili ngs and the Industry Sector  
Exhibit 6.1 indicates the extent  to which securities class acti on claims are correlated with specific 
industries. For example, in 2008, over one-half of all new clai m filings were made against firms in the 
financial sector. In 2013, teleco mmunication and information te chnology companies faced significantly 
more new filings than other indus tries. Contrast this with 2002 , a year in which utilities firms were the 
most prominent securities class action target, a fact indicatin g that not only Enron, but more than one-
third of the companies operati ng within this sector were also s ued.

49 Chapter 7 
Specific Situations Giving Rise to Securities Class Action Claims 
Overview 
Chapter 7 will discuss four speci fic situations that can give r ise to claims against corporate directors and 
officers. These include claims from (1) financial restatements,  (2) initial public offerings (IPOs), (3) 
change-of-control situations, and (4) stock option backdating. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
1. Recognize the meaning of terms and phrases such as financial re instatement, IPO, change-of-
control situations, and stock option backdating 
2. Recognize the exposures associated  with financial reinstatement s, IPOs, change-of-control 
situations, and stock option backdating 
Financial Restatement Claims 
Claims associated with financial  restatements are a substantial  exposure faced by corporate directors and 
officers. Such claims typically result when there is material a djustment to a corporate financial statement 
that affects the cumulative results of operations during past y ears. Usually, a financial restatement takes 
the form of a revision to a corporation’s past operating result s that are significantly less favorable than 
those originally reported (e.g., a company might reveal that in stead of making $22 million in the just-
ended fiscal year, as originally  reported, it actually lost $12  million). Most often, the announcement of a 
restatement triggers a massive sell-off of the company’s stock,  thereby causing invest ors to suffer a severe 
loss. The investors then bring a claim against the company’s di rectors and officers.  
Notable Financial Restatements 
A number of major public corpora tions have issued restatements,  which have, in turn, prompted dramatic 
sell-offs of the organizations’ shares of stock, ultimately tri ggering claims against the firms’ directors and 
officers in many cases.  
 In February 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that American 
International Group, Inc. (AIG) , would pay $800 million to sett le securities fraud charges, in 
which it was alleged that various reinsurance transactions (amo ng other types of transactions) had 
falsely inflated AIG’s loss r eserves by $500 million. As a resu lt of AIG’s restatement in 2004 
(due to the investigation), shareholder equity was reduced by $ 2.26 billion.  
 In the case of WorldCom, routine business expenses were hidden by improperly claiming them as 
long-term investments. According to experts who later examined WorldCom’s books, even a 
routine audit would have uncovere d such practices, which inflat ed the firm’s profits by $4 billion 
in 2001 and part of 2002.   
50  In early 2016, shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International,  Inc., lost more than half of their 
value when the company announced that it would be restating rev enues from fiscal year 2014, 
which had been exaggerated by a bout $58 million (with a subsequ ent impact of $0.09 on earnings 
per share).  
 In the case of Enron, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2001, its regular auditors 
at Arthur Andersen were aware of possible fraudulent practices but failed to act aggressively on 
such information. 
Two key questions should be asked  in conjunction with any finan cial restatement. 
 What events caused the need for a restatement? 
 What kinds of accounting errors and irregularities caused the r estatement?  
What Events Cause the Need for Restatements? 
A number of specific events have most often given rise to corpo rate financial restatements, including the 
following. It is important to note that the frequency of these circumstances typically has an inverse 
relationship with overall stock market performance. A down mark et produces more of these events, while 
a bullish market will typically produce less. 
 Audit exceptions revealed by in dependent auditors (An “exceptio n” in an audit occurs when an 
auditor disagrees with the accounting treatment of a certain it em, such as when a company has 
booked merchandise shipped to deal ers as “final sales” even tho ugh unsold merchandise can be 
returned for full credit.)  
 Incumbent or, in some instances , new management’s discovery of financial improprieties  
 Whistleblower’s reporting (interna l or external) of major finan cial irregularities 
 SEC inquiry, either by the Division of Corporation Finance or t he Division of Enforcement  
 Due diligence review, usually cond ucted in conjunction with mer gers or acquisitions 
 Internal corporate investigati ons (often associated with one or  more of the foregoing situations) 
What Kinds of Accounting Errors and Irregularities Cause Restat ements?  
The following categories of accounting errors and irregularitie s cause restatements.  
Revenue Recognition 
A majority of restatement clai ms involve matters of revenue rec ognition. Such issues can range from the 
intentional, fraudulent recording of fictitious sales to more s ubtle situations involving the timing of sales 
bookings. 
Asset Overstatement 
Such situations involve the overvaluing of inventory, fixed ass ets, and often intangibles, which are 
inherently difficult to value, s uch as goodwill, trademarks, an d patents.  
Restructuring Charges 
When a company closes a division of its business, such as a lar ge manufacturing plant, there will 
ordinarily be significant costs associated with such actions, i ncluding (but not limited to) severance 
payments to workers. However, the  extent of such charges is som etimes either deliberately or negligently 
understated, thus increasing a co rporation’s earnings (or reduc ing its losses).  
51 Accounting for Business Combinations 
This often occurs when a company purchases another company and the buyer either overvalues the assets 
of the entity it has purchased or understates the extent of the  new liabilities, such as potential payments 
that the new company may be obligated to make in conjunction wi th lawsuits that have been filed against 
the newly acquired entity.  
Understatement of Liabilities or Asset Impairments 
Most often, this takes the form  of failure to record contingenc ies that are both likely to occur and 
relatively easy to value, such as uninsured litigation in which  a settlement date is near. Understatement of 
liabilities can also take the form of failure to reflect the im pairment of assets, such as overvaluing 
uncollectible receivables, faili ng to write off obsolete invent ory, or neglecting to report an upcoming 
federal or state tax payment. 
Creation and Misuse of Impermissible Reserves 
These are also known as “cookie ja r reserves,” the sole purpose  of which is to “manage” or “smooth” 
earnings so that a corporation w ill be able to report steady qu arter-to-quarter growth, despite the lack of 
profit from genuine business operations. 
IPO-Related Claims 
IPO-related claims allege vari ous types of wrongdoing in conjun ction with the way in which investment 
bankers or securities underwriters sold shares of stock in the IPO to investors. Such claims were prevalent 
during the late 1990s and early 2000s when the demand for share s in companies making IPOs was 
especially strong, mainly because the U.S. economy was growing rapidly. This environment, combined 
with a rising stock market, made  IPOs a ready source of profit for investors. While IPO-related claims 
experienced a downturn from about 2008 to 2012, the subsequent period from 2013 to 2015 saw a rise 
both in number of completed IPOs and IPO-related lawsuits, as r eported in Kevin LaCroix’s December 2, 
2015, article in The D&O Diary  (“2015 YTD Securities Suit Filings Reflect Increased Numbers o f IPO-
Related Lawsuits”).  
How Does an IPO Work?  
Assume that Company X seeks to raise $100 million to expand its  operations. One means of doing so is to 
sell shares of Company X to the  public. To accomplish this, Com pany X could retain the services of an 
investment banker. The banker would make the arrangements requi red to sell the firm’s shares to the 
public, in return for w hich the investment banker receives a co mmission of 10–20 percent of the proceeds 
that were raised in the process. Buyers in the open market typi cally include a variety of mutual funds, 
banks, pension funds, insurance co mpanies, brokerage houses, co rporations, and individual investors. 
Claims from “Change-of-Control” Situations 
Directors and officers are expo sed to claims in change-of-contr ol situations (e.g., when one company is 
purchased by another company) becau se there is generally an inh erent conflict of interest between and 
among (1) their duty to shareholde rs to ensure that they receiv e a fair and maximum price for their shares, 
(2) their duty to the corporation to protect its best interests  as a corporate entity, and (3) their self-serving 
interest of preserving their own personal jobs and security. 
The Typical Change-of-Control Claim Scenario 
When one or more offers are made to acquire a corporation, dire ctors have the obligation of seeking the 
transaction offering the highest available price to the shareho lders. But given these inherent conflicts, 
virtually any decision reached by corporate managers involving a change-of-control situation may be  
52 subject to attack as an alleged violation of the fiduciary duti es of the directors. This is because the 
corporate directors and officers will be inclined to reject all  offers, no matter how favorable for 
stockholders, because they are lik ely to lose their jobs as a r esult of the buyout.  
Frequent Claimants  
Accordingly, directors and offi cers frequently become targets o f litigation when someone becomes 
dissatisfied with his or her res ponse to a bid. Depending on th e nature of the bid and the board’s reaction 
to it, potential plaintiffs may i nclude shareholders of the cor poration, the persons or entity making the bid, 
creditors, and regulatory agencies. According to some estimates , 1 out of 3 directors and officers liability 
claims are related to mergers and acquisitions.  
Types of Claims Made against Direct ors and Officers in Change-of-Control 
Situations 
The primary allegations against directors of the target company  (i.e., the company being acquired) and, to 
a lesser extent, directors of the acquiring company, include th e following. 
Resistance to Hostile Takeovers  
Directors of a target company who resist a hostile takeover att empt can still be quite vulnerable to legal 
attack. Disgruntled shareholders  often allege that the director s breached their fiduciary duty by resisting 
the takeover proposal, thereby denying the shareholders the opp ortunity to sell their shares at the offer 
price, which is almost always si gnificantly higher than the pri ce at which the stock is trading on the 
various exchanges. The amount of recoverable damages and/or set tlement amount in such a claim can be 
enormous.  
Approval of Friendly Takeovers  
Shareholders frequently sue the  directors of the company being acquired, alleging that the directors failed 
to make an informed decision rega rding the adequacy of the purc hase price. Similarly, it can be alleged 
that the directors failed to “shop” the company to other potent ial buyers who would have offered an even 
higher per-share price. These cases are typically less severe t han the hostile takeover case (above), since 
the potential recoverable damag es are usually much less. Shareh olders in this type of litigation frequently 
seek a “bump-up” in the purchase price.  
For example, Company A was sold to Company B for $80 per share.  However, A’s shareholders allege 
that A is really worth $100 per  share. Thus, A’s  shareholders w ould seek damages of $20 per share in this 
case: the difference between thei r own $100 per share opinion a s to the share’s value and the actual $80 
sale price.  
Preacquisition Mismanagement  
After a company is acquired, the new owners and their appointed  managers may determine that the 
directors and officers of the acquired company mismanaged the c ompany prior to the acquisition. As a 
result, they may sue the prior di rectors and officers for the i njury caused to the company. For example, 
after acquiring Company A, Company B may discover that Company A’s customer base is highly 
dissatisfied with A’s product or service, a fact that Company A  deliberately concealed during acquisition 
negotiations. As a result, four m ajor accounts, comprising 25 p ercent of A’s sales, cease to do business 
with A within 6 months a fter the acquisition.  
These claims are not common becau se the acquiring company typic ally conducts a thorough due diligence 
investigation before agreeing to  purchase the company. However,  this type of claim is brought 
occasionally and is particularly pr oblematic for the defendant directors and officers since they no longer 
control the company, its indemnification policies, or its insur ance programs.   
53 Failure To Disclose  
Change-of-control activity can result in class action securitie s lawsuits against the directors and officers 
of the acquired company, alleging that they did not accurately,  completely, or timely disclose the 
existence of their negotiations o r other related material infor mation about the transaction. Courts have 
refused to articulate a bright-line rule for determining when s uch negotiations must be publicly disclosed. 
Directors and officers are thus  placed in a dilemma of not want ing to disclose the ex istence and terms of 
the negotiations either prematurely or delinquently.  
Early Disclosure 
If disclosure is too early and the transaction does not occur a s disclosed, shareholders who purchased 
stock after the disclosure will allege they were injured becaus e the defendants artificially inflated the 
stock price by the premature disclosure.  
Late Disclosure 
If disclosure is too late, sharehol ders who sold their stock pr ior to the disclosure will allege that they were 
injured because they sold their stock prior to the large price increase following the merger announcement. 
The disclosure exposure exists with respect to directors and of ficers of both the target company and the 
acquiring company.  
Disclosure-Only Settlements 
Another issue related to disclosures is that of disclosure-only  settlements, in which a lawsuit 
accompanying a merger and acquisition transaction is settled by  way of the defendant board of directors 
agreeing to amend its proxy statement and/or tender offer discl osures with additional disclosures. In 
exchange for providing these add itional disclosures, the defend ant board of directors is released from any 
claims.  
The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financ ial Regulation has described this 
tactic as “nuisance litigation” and as a way for plaintiff atto rneys to receive “attorneys’ fees for minimal 
effort,” with the strategy play ing a significant role in the va st majority of change-of-control transactions 
resulting in litigation (“Top M& A Developments and Trends for 2 016”, Barbara L. Borden, February 11, 
2016). Beginning in 2015, the Delaware Court of Chancery took s teps towards abating the disclosure-
only settlement trend by applying greater scrutiny to attorneys ’ fees resulting from these types of 
settlements, but the potential f or these types of settlements a nd other creative plaintiff strategies remains, 
especially in other jurisdictions.  
Mismanagement (Followin g the Acquisition) 
Directors and officers of the acquiring company can also incur liability in connection with their 
management after the acquisiti on. This exposure has proven part icularly problematic when the acquisition 
is part of a diversification program of the acquiring company, since directors and officers of the acquiring 
company frequently have little e xperience in managing a company  in a completely new industry or 
market.  
Claims from “Option Backdating” 
During the spring of 2006 and continuing through the remainder of the year, a number of claims alleging 
illegal backdating of stock opti ons were made against the direc tors and officers of numerous corporations. 
Like IPO-related claims discussed earlier in this chapter, a la rge number of claims produced by illegal 
stock option backdating practices  were made in a relatively bri ef period of time (i.e., the second half of 
2006 and early 2007), a phenomenon that has not been repeated s ince. As of February 1, 2009, 
approximately 33 option backdati ng–related claims have been mad e. However, an abundance of such  
54 claims, given the prevalence of option-related compensation of directors and officers, might reemerge at 
some point, and for that reason, the subject merits discussion.  
What Are “Stock Options”? 
Stock options give an individua l the right to purchase shares o f stock in a corporation at a specified price 
usually, but not always, on or b efore a specified date. Stock o ptions are routinely offered as part of a 
compensation package to corporate officers and directors (and s ometimes to employees) as a means of 
providing them with added incentive to improve the firm’s profi tability, which, in theory at least, will 
boost the market price of the corporation’s stock. 
An Example 
Typically, a board of directors will “price” an option at the m arket price of the stock on the day the option 
is granted. For example, a CEO rec eives a 2-year grant of 100,0 00 options on January 1, 2020, a date on 
which the company’s shares are selling for $25 per share. This gives the CEO the right to purchase 
100,000 shares of the company’s stock on or before January 1, 2 022, for $25 per share. If the CEO 
exercises the option when the s hares are selling for $35 per sh are, he or she will realize a per-share profit 
of $10 ($35 market price minus $25 option price) and a total pr ofit of $1 million (100,000 shares 
multiplied by $10).  
The purpose of such arrangements is to incentivize the CEO to i ncrease the company’s share price. 
Conversely, it also lays the foundation for earnings manipulati on in an attempt to inflate the company’s 
stock price.  
What Is “Backdating”? 
Backdating occurs when the grant date for an award is set at an  earlier date and at a lower exercise price 
than the one on which the option is actually granted. So in the  above example, backdating would occur if, 
on January 1, 2020, the CEO was given a 4-year option grant tha t covered the period from January 1, 
2018, to January 1, 2022. But in this situation, the market pri ce of the stock was $15 on January 1, 2018, a 
fact that would allow the CEO to purchase the stock at $15, rat her than the current $25 share price. As a 
result, the CEO’s profit, assuming he or she exercised the opti on on January 1, 2022, when the stock was 
selling for $35, would be $2 million ($35 share price - $15 exe rcise price x 100,000 shares), as opposed to 
$1 million as in the above example. 
Backdating “Per Se” Is Not Illegal 
One key point regarding backdating is that, by itself, the type  of option backdating noted in the above 
example is not against the law. Rather, what is illegal and what has triggered investigations and lawsuits 
was the fact that a number of companies (1) did not disclose su ch practices to shareholders and the 
general public and, in some instances, (2) director and officer  recipients of options did not pay the 
requisite taxes on them.  
In contrast, the kinds of option practices noted below are clea rly illegal. 
“Spring-loading”: A Controversia l and Illegal Fo rm of Option Ba ckdating  
An even more controversial and usually illegal form of backdati ng is known as “spring-loading.” There 
are two types of spring-loading. 
Granting an Option Just Prior to Favorable News 
One type of spring-loading occurs when an option is granted jus t prior to the announcement of positive 
corporate news. The expectation under such circumstances is tha t the news will boost the company’s 
share price and, therefore, the value of the option grant. For example, assume that Company X is expected  
55 to announce its first quarter earnings on April 20. Although se curities analysts expect Company X to earn 
$1 per share, on April 18, Company X’s comptroller tells Compan y X’s CEO, “This was a blow-out 
quarter. We’re looking at earnings of $2.50 per share.” With th is knowledge, Company X’s CEO calls an 
emergency meeting of the firm’s board of directors, at which he  requests the company’s directors to grant 
him an option to sell 1 million shares of stock, exercisable an y time within the next year. On April 20, 
immediately after the earnings a nnouncement, Company X’s share price soars to from $25 to $45, and the 
next day, the CEO exercises his  option, selling his shares at $ 45 each and garnering a 1-day profit of $20 
million ($45 – $25 = $20 share  price rise x 1 million shares ow ned = $20 million). 
Granting an Option Just after Negative News 
Another type of spring-loading is to make an option grant immed iately after the release of especially 
negative news that has adversely impacted a company’s share pri ce. This has the effect of issuing the 
grant at an artificially low price from which the stock is expe cted to bounce back relatively quickly, 
ultimately increasing the total pr ofit that can be realized. Fo r example, assume the reverse of the above 
situation, whereby quarterly ear nings are expected to be $2.50,  yet company insiders know that they will 
report earnings of just $1. In th is instance, the expectation i s that the earnings “miss” will cause the stock 
to drop, but since there are no other negative issues facing th e company, the share price is expected to 
recover relatively quickly. So i n this case, assuming the negat ive announcement causes Company X’s 
stock to drop from $25 to $15, aft er the announcement, the CEO could seek an options grant of 1 million 
shares at a price of $15, knowing that the stock will rebound w ithin the next year or so, therefore 
increasing his chances of realizi ng a profit on the eventual sa le. 
In order to discourage the two types of spring-loading discusse d above, many companies limit directors 
and officers to a period of time known as a “trading window” (e .g. a 10-day period shortly following the 
release of earnings for a given fiscal period) during which the y are able to trade company securities. 
While some companies restrict both purchases and sales outside of the trading window, others restrict 
only sales and permit purchases.

B. This answer is incorr ect. Old Woman’s due diligence should have  uncovered any problems before 
the acquisition took place. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. The defendants are in no position at present to correct problems that 
occurred in the past. 
D. That’s correct! Their current man agement status is irrelevant, as the claim alleges their prior 
mismanagement. 
5.  
A. This answer is inco rrect. Backdating per se is not illegal. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Until the option holder exercises his  or her option, it produces no taxable 
income. 
C. That’s correct! Failure to disclo se stock option backdating pra ctices to shareholders and the 
general public is illegal. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Stock options are routinely offered t o corporate officer s, directors, and 
even employees to incent them to improve the firm’s profitabili ty.

Parallel Proceedings 
Overview 
As noted at length, the size of settlements in securities class  action claims against directors and officers 
has increased significantly co mpared to years past. Less public ized, and yet no less important, is a similar 
increase in the frequency of proceedings against directors and officers that are separate from but related to 
(i.e. parallel to) securities class action lawsuits. This chapt er sets forth an overview of four types of 
“parallel proceedings”: (1) derivative claims, (2) opt-out laws uits, (3) ERISA stock drop claims, and (4) 
regulatory and criminal proceedings.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter you should be able to do the foll owing. 
1. Recognize the general characteris tics of derivative claims, opt -out lawsuits, ERISA stock drop 
claims, and regulatory and criminal proceedings. 
2. Identify common bases for deriva tive claims, opt-out lawsuits, ERISA stock drop claims, and 
regulatory and criminal proceedings. 
Derivative Claims 
A derivative claim is a type of lawsuit brought by one or more stockholders on behalf of the corporation, 
rather than on their own behalf . The alleged harm must be to th e corporation as a whole, rather than to 
one or more shareholders. Therefo re, any recovery in derivative  suits inures to the benefit of the 
corporation and is paid to the corporation, rather than to the shareholder(s) who institutes the action. 
Although less frequent than securities class action lawsuits, t he personal liability associated with 
derivative claims can be substan tial, and claims of this type h ave increased in frequency over time. 
Common Breaches of Duty Alleged in Derivative Claims 
The breaches of duty most commonly alleged in derivative action s against directors and officers are listed 
in Exhibit 8.1.  
60 Exhibit 8.1 
Most Common Allegations in Derivative Lawsuits 
 Transactions involving undisclos ed conflicts of interest, self -dealing, or personal 
appropriation of corporate opportunities  
 Approval of improper or excessive corporate expenditures  
 Imprudent investment procedures  
 Self-interested, improper, or inadequate consideration of take over offers  
 Improper payment of dividends  
 Improper payment of exe cutive compensation 
 General neglect and mismanagem ent of the corporation  
 
Although the practice of filing a derivative lawsuit in conjunc tion with a securities class action lawsuit is 
not new, the practice has become more common. Increasingly, sop histicated and highly experienced 
plaintiff law firms are handling (and effectively controlling) securities class action lawsuits. 
Consequently, other law firms that are sometimes excluded from these class action lawsuits will often file 
a derivative suit in an attempt to obtain a fee award when the class action case settles . As Judy Greenwald 
noted in a January 2014 article in Business Insurance  (“Derivative shareholder lawsuits are on the rise 
and bring D&O liability risks”), t he focus of derivative lawsui ts has shifted from options backdating to 
merger and acquisition activity, e xecutive compensation, and re gulatory exposures. 
A Notable Derivative Claim 
In what became a record share holder derivative lawsuit settleme nt at the time, video game maker 
Activision settled for $275 milli on in 2014 in response to shar eholder objections to an $8 billion transfer 
of control deal (“Activision settles investor suit for record $ 275 mln,” Reuters, Nov. 19, 2014). In the 
disputed transaction, Activisi on and an investor group bought a pproximately 600 million of Activision’s 
shares from Vivendi, a French conglomerate. The lawsuit alleged  that both the CEO and co-chairman at 
Activision breached their fiducia ry duties and “negotiated a tr ansfer of control from Vivendi to 
themselves, rather than a repurchase of control by Activision.”  More specifically, as reported by Reuters, 
the CEO and co-chairman of Activ ision negotiated their own rece ipt of 25 percent of the investor group’s 
gains in Activision’s stock pri ce once certain thresholds were met, despite only contributing 6 percent of 
the equity for the investor gr oup. In addition to the monetary cost, the settlement re quired two unaffiliated 
directors to be added to Activision’s board, as well as a reduc tion in the voting rights percentage of the 
investor group.  
As reported by Kevin LaCroix in The D&O Diary  on December 5, 2014 (“Largest Derivative Lawsuit 
Settlements”), the nine largest d erivative lawsuit settlements at the time included the following. 
 Activision Blizzard: $275 million 
 News Corp.: $139 million 
 Freeport-McMoRan: $137.5 million 
 Oracle: $122 million 
 Broadcom Corp.: $118 million 
 AIG: $115 million 
 Del Monte Foods: $89.4 million  
61  Pfizer: $75 million 
 Bank of America: $62.5 million 
Opt-Out Lawsuits 
In addition to derivative lawsu its, plaintiff law firms also fi le what are termed individual “opt-out” claims 
on behalf of a single institutiona l investor (e.g., a bank, an insurance company, a p ension fund), rather 
than being part of a class action. 
Why “Opt Out”? 
By bringing a lawsuit that is sep arate from the larger class ac tion lawsuit, these individual plaintiffs can 
sometimes negotiate a larger se ttlement recovery than if the pl aintiffs were passive beneficiaries of the 
larger class action lawsuit.  
Advantages for Directors and Officers 
Opt-out suits may, under certain  circumstances, be beneficial f or corporate defendants.  
First, such settlements could be especially beneficial when one  (or more) claimants is a large institutional 
plaintiff. For example, assume t hat a major pension fund is see king substantial damages from a 
corporation. After the corporation settles separately with the pension fund, the corpor ation may only have 
to deal with the relatively sma ll (individually, at least) inve stors who comprise the members of the class 
action lawsuit. In effect, it may be ridding itself of a major plaintiff by making a separate settlement and, 
thus, reducing the bulk, or at l east a major portion, of its to tal dollar exposure in the process. 
Second, when faced simultaneously with a class action claim and  an opt-out claim, corporate defendants 
may be required to respond to mu ltiple motions and discovery re quests in each of the separate lawsuits, 
which may be filed in differe nt courts throughout the country. Given the rapid accumulation of defense 
costs necessitated by such activ ities, it is often in the direc tors’ and officers’ best interests to settle the 
opt-out claim expeditiously. This allows the directors and offi cers to conserve policy limits available 
under their directors and officers (D&O) policy so that funds w ill be available to settle the class action 
claim.  
Advantages for Opt-Out Plaintiffs 
From the standpoint of a plaintiff, a separate opt-out settleme nt affords two advantages. First, it provides 
a greater chance for an accelerat ed recovery of damages. This i s preferable to waiting as long as a decade, 
the period of time sometimes re quired to settle a class action lawsuit.  
Second, by settling on an accelerated basis, an opt-out plainti ff can obtain earlier access to the D&O 
insurance proceeds that remain available. Often, the protracted  litigation process characteristic of class 
action claims will rapidly deplete D&O policy limits (through t he expenditure of defense costs) before 
claim settlements have even been made. Therefore, settling on a n accelerated basis is o ften beneficial for 
plaintiffs. 
ERISA “Stock Drop” Litigation 
The proliferation and popularity of 401(k) retirement plans has  created yet another substantial liability 
exposure for corporate directors and officers. Given the fact t hat such plans are governed by the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), what a re termed “ERISA stock drops” (or 
less commonly referred to as “ERISA tag-along” suits) rose in f requency around the early 2000s.   
62 401(k) Monies Invested in Company Sto ck: The Trigger for ERISA Stock Drop 
Litigation 
Many corporations’ 401(k) plans i nclude the option to purchase company stock as an investment choice. 
ERISA stock drop claims arise when the market price of company stock drops substantially, an event 
causing 401(k) employee plan holders to suffer losses in their individual accounts. Suc h losses, if they are 
large enough, can result in class action lawsuits against the d irectors and officers of the organizations that 
sponsor the plans. In these lawsu its, employee-plaintiffs alleg e that the directors and officers were 
fiduciaries of the 401(k) plans  and that the conduct required t o administer such plans is governed by the 
provisions found within ERISA. 
Coverage for claims alleging that  the acts of directors and off icers caused employee 401(k) plan holders 
to suffer losses is generally not  available within directors an d officers liability insurance policies (a topic 
discussed in the Management Liab ility Insurance Specialist (MLI S) course “Directors and Officers 
Liability Insurance Coverage”) . This is because the policies al most always contain exclusions for losses 
involving ERISA, as well as claims pertaining to employee benef it programs. Nevertheless, it is important 
to examine the exposure of directors and officers to ERISA stoc k drop litigation, since claims usually 
result from the same acts that also trigger securities claims b rought by shareholders of the corporation.  
Concentration of Employer Stock in 401(k) Plans 
In the period from 1999 to 2014, t he percentage of 401(k) accou nts invested in company stock fell to 
about 7 percent, a decrease of 62 percent. Notably, though, 53 percent of participants in plans with more 
than 5,000 participants were offe red company stock as an option  as of 2013. These statistics are according 
to a December 2014 brief from Employee Benefit Research Institu te titled “401(k) Plan Asset Allocation, 
Account Balances, and Loan Activit y in 2013.” Given this preval ence of company stock as an investment 
option among large  plans, the exposure to litigatio n, settlements, and legal fees  remains significant, 
despite an overall  downward trend in the relative percentage of plan assets consi sting of company stock 
since the early 2000s.  
Specific Allegations against Directors a nd Officers in ERISA Stock Drop Cases 
Following are the most common breaches of duties alleged agains t directors and officers in conjunction 
with ERISA “stock drop” claims. In the past, employee-plaintiff s typically asserted that directors and 
officers did the following. 
 Deceived plan participants and be neficiaries by providing false  and misleading information about 
the company’s finances, which induced the employees to buy shar es of the company’s stock 
 Failed to disclose material inf ormation about the company and i ts financial condition and 
performance, either in statements to the general public, to sha reholders, or to employees 
 Failed to disclose such informa tion to other plan fiduciaries ( such as investment advisors and 
brokers) who had r esponsibility for investing plan assets 
 Failed to correct misleading st atements made by other officers and plan fiduciaries and failed to 
adequately monitor wrongdoing by other plan fiduciaries 
Securities Class Action Litigation ver sus ERISA Stock Drop Litigation  
The following example will illust rate the difference between th e losses sustained by shareholders in a 
securities class action and those suffered by employee 401(k) p lan holders in the “parallel” ERISA stock 
drop litigation.  
63 The Scenario 
Assume that a company’s 1,000 employees hold a total of 1 milli on shares of the company’s stock within 
their 401(k) plans. Also assume th at in addition to these share holders, an additional 5,000 shareholders 
own a total of 5 million shares of the company’s stock. Both gr oups—the employee shareholders and the 
nonemployee shareholders—allege that the directors and officers  of the company ha d been hiding losses 
for a 2-year period and that when the true condition of the fir m was announced, it was required to restate 
its financials. The day of the announcement, the stock dropped from $75 per share to $45 per share.  
The Securities Class Action Claim 
In this lawsuit, the class of 5 ,000 shareholders will allege th at they suffered a loss of $150 million (i.e., 
$75 – $45 = $30 per share loss x 5 million shares = $150 millio n loss). 
The ERISA Stock Drop Claim 
In this lawsuit, the class of 1,000 employee 401(k) plan partic ipants will allege that they suffered a loss of 
$30 million (i.e., $75 – $45 = $30 per share loss x 1 million s hares = $30 million loss). 
Regulatory and Criminal Proceedings 
Claims against directors and officers brought by the Securities  Exchange Commission (SEC), the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), and other regulators have increase d significantly over time. In fiscal year 
2016, the SEC budget surpassed $1.6 billion, an increase of ove r 68 percent since just 2009, when the 
budget was still below the $1 billion mark. Similarly, the numb er of enforcement proceedings brought by 
the SEC has increased dramatica lly. In fact, in fiscal year 201 5, the SEC filed a record 807 enforcement 
actions, resulting in approximate ly $4.2 billion ordered in dis gorgement and penalties, according to a JD 
Supra Business Advisor article w ritten in December 2015 by Mich ael Dicke and Catherine Kevane of 
Fenwick & West LLP (“And the Winner is…The SEC Touts Record Num ber of Cases for Its FY2015, 
and Highlights Innovative Firsts”).  
Other regulators have likewise become much more active in bring ing civil proceedings against companies 
and their directors and officers. Internationally, and particul arly in Latin America, the phenomenon of 
civil litigation following corrup tion investigations has been a  specific area of growth, as discussed by 
Kevin LaCroix in a September 2015 article in The D&O Diary  (“What to Watch Now in the World of 
D&O”). The frequency of criminal proceedings against directors and officers has also continued to 
increase in recent years. As a result, individual defendants in  securities class action lawsuits are also 
frequently the subjects of “paralle l” regulatory or criminal in vestigations and pro ceedings. In effect, a 
“garden variety” class action claim against directors and offic ers often morphs into a regulatory 
investigation and/or criminal proceeding against them. 
Regulatory Investigations and Class Action Claims 
What begins as an investigation by a regulatory agency frequent ly has the potential to evolve into a class 
action lawsuit by a firm’s share holders. For example, at one po int, the DOJ and the SEC were conducting 
investigations of more than 100 corporations in conjunction wit h illegal option backdating practices (as 
discussed earlier in this cour se). The vast majority of these i nvestigations did not result in criminal 
charges or fines and penalties against the companies being inve stigated. (Although in one notable case, 
former UnitedHealth Group, Inc ., CEO William McGuire was requir ed to pay back $418 million in 
option-related compensation that he had obtained illegally.) In  addition, approximately 33 of the firms 
that were investigated eventua lly had class action lawsuits bro ught against them by shareholders in 
conjunction with their opt ion backdating practices.   
64 Criminal Prosecutions and Class Action Claims 
Just as regulatory proceedings a nd investigations are frequentl y conducted on a parallel basis with class 
action lawsuits, such actions are  frequently intertwined with c riminal indictments and prosecutions. 
Again, as in many instances throughout this course, the case of  Enron provides a landmark example of the 
subject at hand. In addition to t he wave of class action lawsui ts brought against the directors and officers 
of Enron, criminal indictments and prosecutions were conducted against numerous Enron executives, 
most notably Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, the company’s former CEO, COO, and 
CFO, respectively. (These three and others were convicted.) 
Special Issues Associated with Parallel Proceedings 
These parallel regulatory and criminal matters create unique pr oblems for the defendants.  
Discovery Issues  
Regulators frequently have extremely broad discovery rights (mu ch more so than do plaintiffs’ attorneys 
in class action litigation). In a ddition, regulators tend to co nduct their investigations more rapidly than do 
class action attorneys. In some i nstances, courts have required  defendant directors and officers to share 
with the securities class action plaintiffs’ attorneys document s given to the government in connection with 
its investigation or proceeding. U nfortunately, the fact that s uch parties now have access to this often 
damaging information heightens the directors’ and officers’ lia bility exposure in the class action case. As 
a result, the evidentiary “road m ap” developed by regulators ca n sometimes be effectively followed by 
class action attorneys in prosecu ting their case against corpor ate directors and officers. This puts these 
defendants at a tremendous disadvantage in the securities class  action case, compared to situations where 
regulatory/criminal investigati ons are not being conducted. 
Burdensome Defense Procedures  
In addition, since the regulatory proceedings are rarely consol idated or coordinated with the class action 
litigation, director and officer defendants must often engage i n duplicate and overlapping discovery 
activities (i.e., taking the time to provide depositions both to regulatory agencies and to attorneys who 
bring class action lawsuits).  
Defense Coverage Issues: The Shrinking Limits Problem 
Yet another difficulty associated with parallel proceedings is the fact that defense costs necessitated by 
criminal indictments and regulatory investigations can rapidly deplete D&O policy limits. This is because 
under D&O policies, insurers are obligated to defend insureds w hen they are criminally indicted and/or 
when a regulatory agency inves tigates the directors and officer s or the corporation. The monies expended 
for providing defense in these s ituations might otherwise be ne eded to defend and settle class action 
claims against directors and officers.  
“White Hats” versus “Black Hats” 
The “competition” for D&O policy limits between so-called “whit e hats” (directors and officers who were 
merely negligent) and “black hat s” (directors and officers who were also guilty of criminal conduct) is 
especially problematic in securities class action claims that a lso involve parallel pr oceedings. To continue 
with the Enron example, a numbe r of officers were convicted of criminal conduct, and the monies 
required to defend them exhausted Enron’s D&O policy limits. Th is left nothing to defend the directors 
whose conduct, while negligent, w as not criminal—a fact that pr obably explains why these “white hat” 
directors were ultimately require d to contribute to the class a ction securities settlement with personal 
funds.  
65 Chapter 8 Review Questions 
1. Sensing a growing opportunity, lawyers working at the law firm Manny, Moe, and Curly 
(MM&C) would like to participat e in securities class action law suits. However, nearly all of these 
suits are handled by law firms w ith a proven track record. MM&C  might still be able to obtain fee 
awards when the class action cases are settled if MM&C files 
A. derivative suits. 
B. single-plaintiff suits. 
C. secondary suits. 
D. tertiary suits. 
2. Monica, who personally owns 20 percent of the outstanding share s of Blue Dress Company, has 
just learned of a class action securities suit being brought ag ainst Blue Dress directors and 
officers on behalf of all shareholders. Monica agrees sharehold ers have grounds for a claim, but 
she decides to negotiate her own  settlement by filing an opt-ou t claim. Why might Monica be 
better off with the opt-out claim  than she would be by particip ating in a class-action lawsuit? 
A. An opt-out claim will not reduce remaining directors and office rs (D&O) policy limits. 
B. As a large institutional invest or, Monica will receive red-carp et treatment. 
C. Monica is likely to recover damages sooner. 
D. Monica will need to hire her own legal counsel. 
3. A combination of two major stockholders’ opt-out lawsuits and a  shareholder class action lawsuit 
against Alphabet Soup Company directors and officers could exha ust the firm’s D&O liability 
insurance limits and leave the co rporation in hot water. The pl aintiffs most likely to recover D&O 
insurance proceeds are 
A. opt-out plaintiffs because major shareholders who settle on an accelerated basis generally 
have earlier access to insurance proceeds. 
B. opt-out plaintiffs because their claims will probably be settle d faster than the class action 
claim. 
C. shareholders participating in t he class action lawsuit because their claims will probably 
be settled faster than the opt-out plaintiffs’ claim. 
D. shareholders participating in t he class action lawsuit because they always have better 
lawyers. 
4. Last Chance Company employees hold 100,000 shares of Last Chanc e stock within their 401(k) 
plans. When Last Chance announces a financial restatement, its stock drops from $50 per share to 
$30 per share. Alleging that Last Chance directors and officers  had concealed the company’s true 
financial condition prior to the financial restatement, employe es bring an Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act (ERISA) stock  drop claim alleging that they  suffered a loss of 
A. $2 million. 
B. $3 million. 
C. $5 million. 
D. confidence in company management.  
66 5. Some directors and officers of the Stepson Hat Company were fou nd to be guilty of criminal 
conduct while others were merely  negligent. However, Sue Ellen,  the 50-year-old vice president 
of human resources, was acquitted of all criminal charges again st her but found to be negligent. 
Sue Ellen would be considered one of the 
A. black hats. 
B. blue hats. 
C. red hats. 
D. white hats.

68 Chapter 9 
Underwriting D&O Liability Insurance: Part 1 
Overview 
This chapter begins with a discussion of the data sources under writers use to evaluate and price a 
directors and officers (D&O) risk. Next, it addresses the first  two of the four major D&O underwriting 
factors that underwriters consider : (1) financial situation and  (2) industry/competitive position. Chapter 
10 examines the next two factors that D&O underwriters also eva luate when pricing a D&O risk: (3) 
internal company issues and (4) composition/operation of the bo ard of directors. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
1. Identify the types of data used in underwriting a D&O policy, a nd recognize the relevance of 
each. 
2. Recognize favorable and unfavorable underwriting characteristic s of a corporation’s financial 
situation and its competitive situation.  
Underwriting Data 
Much of the key data required to  underwrite a D&O policy is pro vided in the application form. In 
addition to a completed applica tion, organizations must usually  provide a number of other items, several 
of which are listed in Exhibit 9.1, during the process of being  evaluated for D&O liability coverage. 
Exhibit 9.1 
Items Typically Necessary To Underwrite a D&O Policy 
 Copies of the corporation’ s latest annual report 
 Copies of all proxy material 
 Corporate bylaws 
 A list of directors and officers  (including subsidiary organiz ations) 
 Copies of the most recent financi al information filed with the  Securities Exchange 
Commission (SEC) (normally 10-K and 10-Q reports)  
 A summary of litigation that t he corporation has been involved  in 
Annual Report 
The annual report is the most im portant piece of information us ed by underwriters because no single 
document conveys as broad an ove rview of the company. A company ’s annual report sets forth a general 
description of a company’s bus iness, discusses current issues a nd conditions affecti ng the business, and 
contains detailed financial data  that explains how the company achieved its earnings during the most  
69 current fiscal year. The majority of publicly traded companies release annual reports in the spring because 
their fiscal years usually run from January 1, 20XX, through De cember 31, 20XX. An annual report 
contains financial data covering this period.  
Annual Report Contents 
Annual reports usually contain ( 1) a chairman’s report, (2) det ailed financial data, ( 3) an auditor’s report 
on corporate governance, (4) the corporate mission statement, ( 5) the corporate governance statement of 
compliance, (6) a roster of and statement of directors’ respons ibilities, and (7) an invitation to the 
company’s annual meeting. 
Financial Data 
The financial section of an a nnual report normally contains (1)  an auditor’s report on the firm’s financial 
statements, (2) a balance sheet, (3) a statement of retained ea rnings, (4) an income statement, (5) a cash 
flow statement, (6) notes to the  financial statements, and (7) a statement of the company’s accounting 
policies.  
Proxy Material 
A proxy statement is a statement  required when a corporation so licits the votes of its shareholders on a 
particular issue. Such statements most often concern mergers an d acquisitions, the election of board 
members, and matters relating to director/executive compensatio n. Proxy statements must be filed with 
the SEC.  
The statement generally includes (1) voting procedures and info rmation on the issue being decided, (2) 
background information about the  company’s nominated directors,  (3) details of director/executive 
compensation, and (4) a breakdown of audit and nonaudit fees pa id to the auditor. Such material is 
important from an underwriting standpoint because it indicates the manner and extent to which the board 
communicates critical information to its shareholders.  
Corporate Bylaws 
A company’s corporate bylaws des cribe the internal rules that g overn its management. They provide 
particular insight into the fr equency of board meetings, types of board committees, number of board 
members, and criteria for board membership. A key aspect of a c orporation’s bylaws concerns the 
procedures for and conditions under which the company will inde mnify directors/officers for claims 
incurred in conjunction with the ir service to the organization.  These kinds of details assist an underwriter 
in evaluating the effectiveness with which the board will be ab le to operate. 
Roster of Direct ors and Officers 
The essence of any D&O risk is the integrity, knowledge, and ex perience possessed by those who occupy 
the roles of directors and officers. The roster of directors an d officers (which also includes their 
committee assignments) provides an  underwriter with the informa tion required to analyze the 
backgrounds of the people who o ccupy these important positions.  
SEC Reports 
Public companies are required to make regular filings with the SEC, which underwriters also review 
carefully. The filings consist of t he company’s key financial s tatements, which must be submitted each 
quarter. Underwriters are especially interested in such filings  because, compared to the financial data in 
the company’s annual report, they provide a more current pictur e of a company’s finances.  
70 Financial Situation 
The actual pricing of a D&O policy is related to—although not s trictly a function of—the dollar amount 
of a firm’s total assets. A number of other important factors a re also considered in developing a premium 
for a D&O policy. Accordingly, p ricing D&O liability insurance is a highly subjective process. In arriving 
at premiums, D&O underwriters beg in by analyzing a company’s fi nancial position.  
A firm’s key financial areas include the following. 
 Profitability  
 Leverage  
 Accounting and financial reporting practices 
 Liquidity  
 Stock price volatility 
Profitability 
Profitability is a concern to D&O  underwriters given the strong  correlation between lack of profit and the 
incidence of claims against directors and officers. Thus, the a bility of a firm to generate acceptable levels 
of profits for its investors is the single most important finan cial indicator evaluated by underwriters.  
Profitability: The Double-Edge d Sword of D&O Underwriting 
Despite the fact that profitability is generally recognized as a key D&O underwriting factor, it should be 
remembered that many companies , like Enron, are “profitable” ri ght up to the moment they declare 
bankruptcy.  
Profit: An Elusive Concept 
“Profit” has, in many instances , become an accounting construct  rather than an infallible indicator of a 
company’s long- or short-term v iability. Accordingly, what is m ost important from an underwriting 
standpoint is to understand exactly where profit is coming from  and how it is derived. In fact, certain 
companies are excellent D&O risks despite the fact that they re port losses year after year (e.g., 
development-stage biotech firms t hat have products on the drawi ng board but haven’t sold them yet). 
Profit alone may—or may not—say very much about a particular co mpany’s propensity to have a claim 
made against its directors and officers. 
One leading underwriter captured this dilemma best when he comm ented that “companies managing to 
report ever-increasing profits and consistently exceed Wall Str eet’s expectations by wide margins are 
arguably the scariest companies out there!” 
Countrywide Financial: A Case Study  in the Sometimes-Illusory N ature of “ Profit” 
In an October 1, 2007, The New York Times  op-ed piece titled “ Enron’s Second Coming?,” Nobel Prize-
winning economist Paul Krugman des cribed the problems faced by Countrywide Financial, the nation’s 
largest subprime lender, comparing them to the Enron situation.  A one-time darling of growth-enamored 
Wall Street analysts, Countrywide’s shares fell by more than 50  percent during the prior year. The 
company was technically insolvent  when Bank of America acquired  it in January 2008. 
The op-ed noted similarities between both Enron and Countrywide  in terms of (1) stellar earnings 
immediately prior to announced internal problems, (2) high CEO compensation relative to competitors, 
(3) CEO stock sales just prior to large share price drops, and (4) radiant business press coverage in which 
both Enron’s CEO, Kenneth Lay, a nd Countrywide’s CEO, Angelo Mo zilo, were lauded not only as great 
businessmen, but also as great human beings.  
71 Quality of Earnings vers us Quantity of Earnings 
Countrywide was a textbook case of how the quality  of a company’s earnings—in this case, from 
mortgage loans made to people lacking the financial wherewithal  to repay them—took a back seat to the 
quantity  of those earnings in Wall Street’s assessment of the company. If a company consistently reports 
sales and profit growth far above industry averages and receive s exuberant write-ups in the financial 
press, underwriters must look more deeply into the true nature of the company’s operations. Problems 
could, and often do, lie ahead. 
Leverage 
A debt to equity ratio provides an underwriter with insight int o a firm’s financial structure. This ratio 
indicates the relationship of debt to equity financing and the degree to which a company is leveraged (i.e., 
the portion of debt used to fina nce the business). Many compani es utilize greater leverage (i.e., debt) to 
increase performance results or stretch limited resources. Heig htened leverage creates heightened risks.  
Interpret Debt to Equi ty Ratios Carefully 
A company’s debt to equity ratio must be interpreted carefully.  From a creditor’s standpoint, a high 
proportion of owners’ equity is desirable. This is because equi ty provides a substantial protective buffer 
of owners’ investment for credito rs in the event the company su ffers a loss. However, from an owner’s 
standpoint, a high proportion of owners’ equity may or may not be desirable. If borrowed funds can be 
used by a business to generate earnings in excess of the after- tax cost of the interest on such borrowed 
funds, a lower percentage of owne rs’ equity may be desirable.  
Conversely, too low an equity ratio (i.e., too much debt) may b e hazardous from the owner’s standpoint. 
Underwriters should be leery of f irms that appear heavily depen dent on debt and whose ability to meet 
debt repayment requirements is suspect. For such firms, a busin ess recession could result in operating 
losses and shrinkages in the valu es of assets (such as receivab les and inventories). This, in turn, could 
lead to an inability to meet fixed payments for interest and pr incipal on debt. Similarly, underwriters 
should avoid firms that are especially vulnerable to changes in  interest rates, such as companies that 
maintain a high percentage of “f loating rate” debt, the cost of  which could increase substantially.  
Accounting and Financial Reporting Practices 
Accounting and financial reporti ng practices are a key componen t for underwriters to evaluate in 
developing an understanding of the  company’s financial picture.  The five examples noted in Exhibit 9.2 
illustrate the kinds of accountin g and financial reporting prac tices that can be especially problematic.  
72 Exhibit 9.2 
Problematic Accounting and Financial Reporting Practices 
 Complex business ar rangements that are d ifficult to understand  and appear to serve little 
purpose from a practical standpoint (e.g., Enron had numerous “ off-balance-sheet 
partnerships” that were us ed to hide excessive debt) 
 Changes in auditors over accounting or auditing disagreements (i.e., the new auditors 
agree with management, and the old auditors did not, which is w hy they were replaced) 
 Unusually rapid gro wth and profitability that is significantly  better than competitors, despite 
a lack of substantive difference in the nature of operations (e .g., Countrywide Financial 
generated outsize returns compar ed to its competitors, despite essentially identical 
business practices) 
 Inability to generate cash flows from operations while reporti ng significant earnings growth 
(a sign of earnings manipulation) 
 A consistently close or exact m atch between the reported resul ts and planned results (e.g., 
results that are always exactl y on budget or managers who alway s achieve 100 percent of 
bonus opportunities, which is ye t another sign that earnings ar e being “managed”) 
Liquidity 
Adequate liquidity (i.e., cu rrent assets less current liabiliti es) is important to a company, given the 
possibility of unforeseen emergenci es (e.g., a sharp downturn i n sales during a recession), as well as 
unanticipated business opportun ities (e.g., the opportunity to expand into a new product line). In addition, 
a firm’s inability to accumulate  sufficient working capital cou ld indicate poor financial management. 
Lastly, what constitutes a reas onable amount of liquidity varie s with the degree of uncertainty inherent in 
a given industry group. For example, a high-tech company would need considerable working capital, 
given continuous innovation in t hat industry and the need for t he rapid introduction of new products.  
Liquidity and Lines of Credit 
Existing lines of credit are an  important component of a firm’s  liquidity position. Companies must have 
adequate lines of credit in pl ace in the event that profitable business opportunities emerge or, 
alternatively, unforeseen problem s arise. The inability to esta blish and maintain adequate lines of credit 
may indicate poor relationships with the banking industry and/o r deeper rooted financial issues. 
Stock Price Volatility 
Companies whose share prices ha ve historically been significant ly impacted by even minor events have a 
tendency to produce shareholder class action claims. Thus, firm s with volatile stock prices produce a 
“caution flag” for many underwriters. There is, however, some d isagreement on this point because many 
businesses that exhibit volatile sto ck prices have not had a hi story of class action claims made against 
them. Conversely, numerous companies with relatively stable sha re prices have been frequently involved 
in such litigation. In addition, volatility is related to a fir m’s particular industry group. Therefore, stock 
price volatility/stability should be viewed as one of several i mportant finance-related underwriting factors 
and not in isolation. 
Industry/Competitive Position 
A firm’s competitive position in a given industry encompasses f our significant factors: market share, 
competitive structure of the industry, revenue sources, and ind ustry group.   
73 Market Share 
As has been emphasized throughout this course, merger and acqui sition activity frequently gives rise to 
claims. Therefore, firms with a relatively small market share ( e.g., 5 percent or less in a given industry or 
product type) are attractive take over candidates, and such comp anies should be carefully underwritten. 
However, even industry leaders are not immune to takeover attem pts, given the emergence of creative 
financing techniques in the 1980s , such as leveraged buyouts, w hereby takeovers of multibillion-dollar 
corporations have been almost completely financed by debt. 
Competitive Structure of the Industry 
The degree of competition within an industry is another factor that underwriters must assess. Firms 
engaged in highly competitive industries where markets are satu rated with products and are characterized 
by overcapacity are especially r isky. Such problems are exacerb ated when the industry’s products are 
subject to rapid obsolescence, as was the case with most high-t ech firms during the 1999–2002 period in 
which firms in this industry we re subject to chaotic earnings f luctuation.  
Revenue Sources 
Companies dependent on a few large customers for a significant portion of their revenues are generally 
poor D&O risks. (This is especially  true when profit margins ar e declining within the entire industry.) For 
such firms, the loss of only a handful of key customers can cau se earnings to plunge , thereby increasing 
the firm’s susceptibility to claims.  
Consumer versus Business-Dependent Companies 
In addition, firms who sell their products largely to other bus inesses—rather than to consumers—are 
much more vulnerable to wide swings in earnings and, ultimately , claims against their directors and 
officers. Many of the bankruptcies and financial difficulties e xperienced by high-tech firms from 2000 to 
2002, an especially volatile period for that specific industry,  can be explained by the overall lack of 
investment spending by corporati ons during this period. Accordi ngly, firms whose customers are 
principally other businesses are riskier from a D&O standpoint because consumer spending is 
considerably less volatile than sp ending by corporations. For e xample, the 2007–2009 stock market 
plunge did not impact the share prices of consumer products man ufacturers such as Kraft, Procter & 
Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson as severely as it impacted heavy equipment manufacturers that sell 
almost exclusively to other businesses, like Caterpillar and Jo hn Deere. 
Industry Group  
The industry group in which a company operates correlates signi ficantly with D&O claim activity. 
Historically, patterns have eme rged in which a particular indus try group bears the brunt of numerous 
claims during a certain tim e period, as discussed below.  
1999–2002: The High-Te ch Claim Wave 
From the end of the 1990s and ear ly 2000s, approximately 56 per cent of all federal class action securities 
claims were filed against compan ies involved in three broad ind ustry groups: computer services, 
telecommunications, and electronics. 
2007–2009: The Banking/Financial Se rvices/Real Estate Wave  
Just as technology companies we re the most susceptible to claim s during the 1999–2002 period, during 
the years 2007–early 2009, banks , brokerages, and real estate/c onstruction-related industries bore the 
brunt of the claims onslaught. The Stanford Law School’s Securi ties Class Action Clearinghouse (SCAC) 
and Cornerstone Research for the year ending 2008 indicated the  extent to which claims were heavily 
concentrated by industry group. Specifically, approximately hal f of the suits involved some aspect of the  
74 credit meltdown, since 103 such su its named firms in the financ ial industry as defendants, including 55 
percent of the financial companies in the S&P 500 Index. 
As was pointed out by Kevin LaCroix in The D&O Diary,  of the 152 subprime and credit crisis–related 
securities lawsuits that have been  filed as of February 4, 2009 , 117 of them have involved companies or 
other entities with standard industrial classification codes (S IC) in the 6000 series (finance, insurance, and 
real estate). And of the 18 entities that have been sued but th at have no SIC code designated, these entities 
are heavily populated by mutual funds, private equity firms, he dge funds, and foreign firms whose shares 
are not traded on U.S. exchanges. 
2013–2015: The Biotechnology/Pharma ceuticals/Healthcare Wave 
As shown in another Stanford Law School SCAC and Cornerstone Re search report, “Securities Class 
Action Filings: 2015 Year in Review ,” the “Consumer Non-Cyclica l” sector became an especially 
prominent arena for securities class action filings between 201 3 and 2015. This industry classification 
encompasses biotechnology, pharmac euticals, and healthcare, as well as an “other” category (primarily 
agriculture, beverage, commerc ial services, and food subsectors ). Claims from this sector constituted 
approximately 32 percent of all filings from 2013 to 2015 (the next highest industry, communications, 
amounted to less than 13 percent during the same period). 
More specifically, the report also showed that filings against biotechnology, healthcare, and 
pharmaceutical companies (ignoring the “other” class) increased  in each year during the 3-year period, 
with pharmaceutical companies accounting for the most filings o f any subsector.  
Given such data, underwriters w ill add a significant premium lo ading to firms whose businesses are 
concentrated within an industry or industry group that is part of a D&O securities litigation “wave.”

77 Chapter 10 
Underwriting D&O Liability Insurance: Part 2 
Overview 
This chapter will examine the ot her two broad areas considered by directors and officers (D&O) 
underwriters: internal company  factors and composition/operatio n of the board of directors. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
1. Identify the internal company factors a typical D&O underwriter  considers important distinguish 
between positive and negative underwriting characteristics. 
2. Recognize favorable and unfavorable underwriting characteristic s of a corporate board of 
directors. 
Internal Company Factors 
The third general area evaluated by underwriters involves the s pecific circumstances particular to an 
individual company. The followi ng paragraphs discuss these area s. 
Merger and Acquisition Activity 
As stated often within this c ourse, D&O claim susceptibility is  related to the frequency of a company’s 
involvement in merger and acquisition activity. Merger and acqu isition activity presents a number of 
problematic issues, all of which can lead to claims, as follows .  
 Acquiring companies  are always vulnerable to criticism that the purchase price pai d for the 
company it acquired was excessive.  
 Acquired companies’  directors and officers have a vested interest in preserving th eir own 
positions and are naturally predi sposed to rejecting a takeover  offer, even those clearly in the best 
interest of the stockholders. Moreover, when they accept such a n offer, the directors and officers 
are vulnerable to criticism that the offer was inadequate. 
As a result, underwriters usua lly perceive a company with a pro clivity for merger and acquisition activity 
as a higher-than-average claim risk. According to publishing ho use Raconteur Media’s report “M&A 
Outlook 2016,” five sectors in par ticular were leading the way in merger and acquisition activity at the 
time of the report: financial services, telecommunications, pha rmaceuticals, computer manufacturing, and 
oil and gas.  
Breadth/Concentration of Stock Ownership 
The more widely held a stock, the greater the chance that some party owning it will bring suit against the 
organization. For this reason, c losely held public companies ha ve a dramatically lower level of claim 
frequency, compared to those with more diffused, public stock o wnership. A closely held public company  
78 is one in which a high percentage  of the firm’s stock (e.g., 50  percent or more) is owned by the firm’s 
directors and officers or other so-called insiders, yet is also  held by members of the public and is traded 
on one or more of the large national stock exchanges. (This is distinct from a privately held company in 
which directors/officers/other insiders own all of a company’s shares and the company’s shares are not 
traded on a public exchange.) 
Underwriters are leery of publicly held companies in which one or more outsiders hold large blocks of a 
firm’s stock. Such persons (or institutions, in some cases) hav e a great deal at stake in the firm’s fortunes 
and are therefore prime candidates for suing at the first sign of a business downturn. (D&O liability 
policies do, however, often contai n exclusions that bar coverag e for suits brought by individuals owning 
more than 10 percent, and in some cases, more than 5 percent, o f a company’s outstanding shares. 
Fortunately for insureds, this is one provision within D&O poli cies that is typically negotiable to some 
degree.)  
Future Company-Specific Risks  
A key underwriting factor for any individual company is whether  the firm is susceptible to a single event 
or change that could substantiall y alter the company’s fortunes . Examples of such vulnerabilities include 
(1) dependence on a single customer, contract, product, or supp lier (often typical of manufacturers of 
industrial equipment); (2) a company holding a patent on a majo r product (e.g., a pharmaceutical 
manufacturer) that is about to expire; (3) a company dependent upon a natural resource that is in short 
supply and/or whose price can fluctuate wildly (e.g., an airlin e’s dependence upon fuel prices; an oil 
exploration firm); or (4) a company awaiting the outcome of pen ding high-stakes litigation.  
Service Provider Relationships 
Underwriters are alert for high turnover rates in the firm’s as sociations with key outside service 
organizations. Changes in major ( 1) banking relationships, (2) independent auditors, (3) law firms, (4) 
investment bankers, (5) pension fund/investment managers, and ( 6) insurance brokers could indicate 
potential difficulties.  
Company Size 
As already mentioned in this section, claims against a firm’s d irectors and officers are related to the 
organization’s asset size. For this reason, premium for a D&O p olicy correlates closely with a company’s 
total assets. The larger the firm, the more vulnerable it is to  suits, mainly as a result of wider public 
visibility, coupled with more di versified stock ownership. 
Company Age 
Underwriters generally prefer older, more established organizat ions to relatively newer firms. 
Accordingly, it is more difficu lt to secure D&O coverage for co mpanies that have been in business less 
than 5 years. Start-ups and firm s that have only been in busine ss for brief periods of time pose added risks 
associated with so-called “growt h companies” (e.g., suits arisi ng out of initial public offerings) and also 
must buck the odds implicit in the high failure rate for all ne w businesses. Absent the longevity required 
to demonstrate a track record of sustained profits, relatively new companies are less desirable D&O risks, 
and their premium rates reflect this. 
Degree of Diversification 
Diversified conglomerates produ ce a higher incidence of claims than do companies with business 
activities confined to more limited sectors and product lines. Risks of financial loss tend to increase as 
firms begin to depart from thei r core businesses and diversify into unrelated endeavors where senior 
management has relatively little e xperience. Clearly, the organ ization’s inclination to integrate vertically 
or horizontally appears to augmen t its risk of lawsuits against  the firm’s directors and officers.  
79 Degree of Centralization 
Highly centralized organizations  pose reduced risks of D&O clai ms because they are easier to control and 
manage compared to firms operating on a more decentralized basi s. Accordingly, companies with 
subsidiaries and divisions that function on a relatively autono mous basis, especially in financial matters 
(e.g., subsidiaries having separate banking, insurance, and out side auditing relationships), are carefully 
underwritten. Similarly, underwriters must closely examine firm s with overly complex organizational 
structures, especially those operating in tax-haven jurisdictio ns for which there appears to be no clear 
business purpose. 
Public Perception 
Studies and surveys by major business publications have proven conclusively that the public holds certain 
firms in higher esteem than it does others (e.g., Fortune  magazine’s annual survey of the “World’s Most 
Admired Companies”). Those held in lesser esteem are somewhat m ore vulnerable to D&O claims than 
companies that are highly regarded. 
A firm’s risk management program  can often provide valuable ins ight to a D&O underwriter. Adverse 
loss experience in major property and casualty lines might sugg est management problems. Stability of 
relationships with insurers and brokers also offers clues about  the organization. Finally, management’s 
involvement with and support of p roperty and liability loss con trol programs often indicate its willingness 
to minimize D&O claim exposures. 
Loss History 
Underwriters also consider a com pany’s prior claim record in ev aluating a D&O risk. Most important is 
whether and to what extent an or ganization implemented procedur al changes to avoid future claims from 
a similar source.  
Certainly, a firm’s previous loss experience influences the lik elihood of future claim activity. 
Nevertheless, that record must be  analyzed in light of changes within management and the board of 
directors.  
Composition and Operation of the Board of Directors 
Although underwriters carefully e valuate financial, industry/co mpetitive, and internal company factors, 
the essence of any D&O risk is th e quality of th e individuals w ho serve as directors and officers. 
According to Dan Bailey, a not ed authority on D&O liability, 
[T]he single most important underwriting consideration is the q uality of the people 
involved in the management of the  corporation. Any future claim  under the policy will 
relate to the alleged actions o r omissions of these people. The refore, the more experienced, 
capable, honest, knowledgeable and forthright is the management , the less risk of valid 
claims being asserted.  
Degree of Control by the Chai rman or Other Individuals 
Underwriters should be w ary of boards on which a single individ ual, usually the chairman of the board, 
appears to exercise a disproportionate degree of control over t he organization. Such control sometimes 
leads to a “groupthink” mentality in which other directors and officers merely rubber-stamp the initiatives 
proposed by the chairman of the board without carefully examini ng the details and assumptions 
underlying his or her ideas.  
Conversely, and although this i s less often the case, problems can arise when the board chairman is 
relatively weak. Board chairmen who are too easily influenced b y others are somet imes coerced into  
80 making unwise decisions. Firms tha t have chairmen with good ide as—but little influence—are prone to 
ill-advised actions that sometimes produce claims. 
Board Selection Criteria and Composition 
In addition to evaluating the boa rd chairman, underwriters must  also assess the individuals comprising a 
company’s board of directors. A lthough no consistent criteria e xist for being selected as a director, such 
persons should possess integrity, a n inquiring mind, ample expe rience, good business judgment, and an 
understanding of business fundamentals (e.g., finance, law, mar keting, accounting, and investing). 
Perhaps most importa nt is the fact that board members should no t be selected purely on the basis of 
friendship or politics.  
Specific Selection Criteria 
Underwriters consider three specific factors in evaluating the individuals who make up a firm’s board of 
directors: size of the board, diversity of experience, and inde pendence.  
Size of the Board 
The typical board of directors of the average publicly held cor poration numbers around 12 persons. Yet it 
is debatable whether this is r eally an optimal number. Often, d etailed questioning and extended discussion 
is impossible in a group of this  size, so in some instances, a smaller number of persons, perhaps as few as 
6, would function more effectively while still offering a diver sity of backgrounds and experience. 
Accordingly, a board size of at least 6, but no more than 12, i s the optimal range for a public company.  
Diversity of Experience 
Directors should possess experience in areas not solely confine d to the company’s core business. For 
example, the outside directors of a bank should come from sever al different industry backgrounds rather 
than being restricted to persons with banking as their principa l business experience. This diversity of 
perspectives will be beneficial for decision-making processes t hat extend beyond a company’s typical 
operational comfort zone. 
Independence 
Underwriters must carefully exami ne the relationships between b oard members and the companies they 
have been asked to serve. Some d egree of detachment from the or ganization is desirable. Close 
connections sometimes produce c onflicts of interest. Moreover, underwriters should question the boards 
of firms when all or most of the  members are inside (i.e., an e mployee of the company), rather than 
outside (i.e., a nonemployee of the company), directors. Unless  a firm has a number of board members 
who have no connection to the fir m, the objectivity of the boar d’s decision-making process is likely to be 
compromised.  
Compensation Method of Management 
Underwriters should also carefu lly consider the manner in which  operating management is compensated. 
Some industry observers go so far as to assert that “outsized” executive compensation is the single most 
reliable risk marker, as it usua lly invites a host of dangerous  (and sometimes destructive) behaviors. 
Certainly, many of the most eg regious corporate scandals have i nvolved excessive executive 
compensation. Accordingly, underwriters will consider the detai ls surrounding executive compensation as 
an important component of the risk analysis.  
Analyze the Effect o f “Nonsalary” Items 
Underwriters should be especially  wary of firms in which compen sation of management is heavily 
dependent on nonsalary items, suc h as bonuses, stock options, a nd similar incentives. One problem with  
81 these types of arrangements is t hat they often encourage excess ive risk taking, promote the 
implementation of overly aggr essive accounting methods, or, in the worst-case scenario, provide 
incentive to commit fraud by boosting reported earnings. Anothe r problem is that these nonsalary items 
are also more easily hidden from public disclosure—yet another factor that creates incentive for excessive 
risk taking.  
The Greatest Danger: When CEOs “Manage” Earnings  
Many observers agree that there i s great danger inherent in man agement compensation plans that heavily 
utilize stock options. Under these conditions, CEOs have partic ular incentive to maximize the company’s 
stock price, which, in turn, enc ourages earnings manipulation. Accordingly, CEOs will be more likely to 
artificially increase earnings by means of questionable, if not  fraudulent, accounting practices. One 
example of this would be a sudde n increase in company stock buy -backs. Since more buy-backs means 
fewer shares outstanding, which in turn means higher earnings p er share, CEOs may be tempted to utilize 
this tactic to positively influen ce their compensation packages . 
This link between incentive-based  compensation plans and “manag ed” earnings was the conclusion of a 
study by Lin Peng and Ailsa Röell, and published by the Oxford Journals , titled “Executive Pay and 
Shareholder Litigation” (Decemb er 2005), noting that “there is a significant relationship between option-
based executive compensation and shareholder class litigation” and that “incentive pay in the form of 
options significantly increases th e probability of  a shareholde r class action lawsuit.” 
Earnings and Auditors 
Another related problem is the f act that there is an inherently  “incestuous” relationship between 
companies and their supposedly i ndependent auditing firms. In t he case of Enron (and other corporations 
as well), Enron pressured its auditing firm, Arthur Andersen, t o certify financial statements that Andersen 
knew were highly inaccurate, if not  fraudulent. Andersen’s ince ntive to comply was that Enron also 
provided Andersen with lucrative consulting engagements that, i n reality, were much more profitable for 
Andersen than was the standard audit work. This allowed Enron t o pressure Andersen into certifying 
Enron’s blatantly misstated earnings. Ultimately, such deceptio n helped to maintain a high share price and 
increase the extent of earnings-dri ven compensation plans for t op management.  
CEO Compensation Packages: What To Look for  
Given the frequency of compensa tion-related D&O claims coupled with the correlation between options-
driven compensation packages and securities litigation (as alre ady noted in this course), underwriters 
carefully scrutinize the details of the CEO’s employment contra ct. Questions to be posed include the 
following.  
 Are the compensation levels realistic?  
 Are the compensation levels in line with other CEOs in the same  industry?  
 Does the nature of the compensa tion plan provide more incentive  to manage the stock price than 
to manage the company itself? 
 Does the compensation package achieve the right mix of both sho rt- and long-term performance 
incentives? 
Analyzing Board Turnover 
Frequent turnover among a firm’s officer/director group indicat es the possible presence of inherent 
conflicts and problems that could only be resolved by resignati ons—voluntary or otherwise. When 
evaluating a prospective insured, underwriters should request a dditional information concerning the 
reasons for such turnover.   
82 Assessing the Board’s Knowle dge of the Organization 
It is important for an underwriter to assess the extent to whic h the directors are knowledgeable about the 
organization. Absent such know ledge, a director will be unable to render sound advice when the 
organization is presented with var ious options or courses of ac tion in specific situations. 
Preliminary study, prior to joining a board, should include rev iews of the corporate charter or bylaws and 
recent board and committee meeti ng minutes. Additionally, a new  director should be aware of the 
immediate political, legal, and competitive environment in whic h the organization operates.  
A number of authorities recommend that new directors meet priva tely with the firm’s independent 
auditors, as well as with its outside counsel. These meetings c an provide a somewhat less biased view of 
the organization than would be obtained from inside directors a nd will assist the new director in 
formulating a more objective opinion about the company. Not onl y must new directors receive a thorough 
orientation, but existing direct ors should also continually upd ate their knowledge of the important areas 
that affect the company. Corporate governance experts also reco mmend that the board should 
communicate frequently with the company’s CFO, particularly if a director is on the audit committee.  
Assessing the Board’s Knowledge of  Nonindustry—Yet Essential—Areas 
Underwriters must also evaluate whether and to what extent the board has expertise in areas that, while 
not directly involving the organi zation’s core business, are ne vertheless critical to the company’s 
success—and perhaps even its sur vival. A particular noteworthy example (yet by no means the sole 
specialized area in which a boa rd requires expertise) involves knowledge of electronic data security. 
Given the demonstrated threats to businesses posed by electroni c hacking and data breach activity, it is 
imperative that corporate boards have at least one member who p ossesses deep knowledge in this 
functional discipline. 
Conducting Face-to-Face Meetings with Management 
In an effort to more carefully e valuate the all-important peopl e factor, underwriters should request face-
to-face meetings with top managem ent personnel when plausible. Many of the questions raised in this 
discussion of D&O underwriting are more easily answered by the impressions obtained from such 
meetings rather than simply rely ing on data submitted with an a pplication or acquired from online 
sources. 
Underwriter meetings with an ins ured’s CFO can help an underwri ter develop a “comfort level” with a 
prospective insured’s financia l data. Alternatively, these meet ings may reveal problems indicating that 
financial statements cannot be taken at face value and that pot ential claim issues lurk beneath an 
otherwise rosy picture presented by the insured. Whichever the case, face-to-face meetings can sometimes 
afford the underwriter the opportunity to obtain clarification and ask questions that may assist in 
developing a clearer pictu re of a given D&O risk.  
Conclusion: The Art of D&O Underwriting  
Underwriting D&O insurance is as much an art as a science. Ther e are innumerable different types of 
businesses, the details of which uniquely affect a D&O risk fro m an underwriting standpoint. In addition, 
it should be apparent that most of the factors discussed above are not subject to exact quantification. 
Thus, successful underwriters u se their experience, judgment, a nd well-honed instincts—rather than a 
strict set of rules—to determine  the premium level and the scop e of coverage they will offer in response 
to a request for D&O insurance . Of course, in addition to deter mining appropriate premiums and scopes 
of coverage, underwriters must al so make impactful decisions re garding limits, sublimits, and retentions, 
depending on the insured.  
83 Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1. National Acquirer Company’s market share is on the rise since i t has gradually been buying out 
its major competitors. Directors and officers (D&O) underwriter s would probably consider 
National Acquirer a higher-than -average claim risk because 
A. National Acquirer’s directors and officers might be more intere sted in preserving their 
own positions than in protecting the company. 
B. National Acquirer’s shareholders might accuse directors and off icers of paying too little 
to acquire another company. 
C. National Acquirer’s shareholders might accuse directors and off icers of paying too much 
to acquire another company. 
D. buying out smaller competitors is illegal. 
2. Vista Corporation stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchang e. Hank was Vista 
Corporation’s chairman of the boa rd until his ouster a few year s ago. He still owns 40 percent of 
Vista’s stock, a much larger sha re than any other individual or  organization. Current directors and 
officers collectively own only 12 percent of Vista’s outstandin g stock. In reviewing Vista’s D&O 
application, underwriters would most likely 
A. be leery because Hank is likely to  sue at the first sign of a b usiness downturn. 
B. exclude coverage for c laims brought by shareholders other than Hank. 
C. reduce the premium because concen tration in stock ownership ten ds to reduce claim 
frequency. 
D. view Vista favorably because cl osely held public companies have  a relatively low claim 
frequency. 
3. All else being equal, D&O underwr iters tend to prefer a firm th at is 
A. relatively large but older and well established. 
B. relatively small but older and well established. 
C. a relatively large start-up firm. 
D. a relatively small start-up firm. 
4. Because Frank Sonata, Chairman of the Blue Eyes Company board o f directors, selected nearly 
all of the firm’s directors and officers, he also believes he c an terminate any board member who 
disagrees with him. Consequently , there is little disagreement among board members. Whenever 
a board decision produces favorab le results, Frank loudly procl aims, “They did it my way!” 
Unfavorable results are not discussed. In evaluating these circ umstances, a D&O underwriter 
would 
A. be wary because Frank appears to exercise a disproportionate de gree of control. 
B. suspend judgment pending more de tailed analysis of the results of Frank’s decisions. 
C. view Frank’s strong leadership favorably. 
D. view the board’s lack of dissen t favorably, since dissent tends  to generate claims. 
   
84 5. Jack and Jill have just been elected as new outside directors o f Well Company. In order to get a 
somewhat unbiased view of Well Company, it would be a good idea  for Jack and Jill to 
A. hold one-on-one meetings with top corporate officers. 
B. meet privately with the board c hairman and inside counsel. 
C. meet privately with the firm’s independent auditors and outside  counsel. 
D. review the corporation’s annual report to stockholders, press r eleases, and other public 
documents.  
85 Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Self-p reservation can always be a pro blem, but it is not specific to 
corporate acquisitions. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. Shareholders would not be likely to c omplain that their interests were 
damaged by National Acquirer’s bargain purchase. 
C. That’s correct! An acquiring company is always vulnerable to cr iticism that the purchase price 
paid for a company it acquired was excessive. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Buying out competitors is not by itse lf illegal. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! One person or or ganization with a great deal at  stake is a prime candidate for suing 
at the first sign of a business downturn. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Claims brought by Hank are a bigger c oncern. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. This sort of concentration in stock o wnership can lead to a claim. 
D. This answer is incorrect. In gen eral, closely held public compa nies have a relatively low claim 
frequency, but Vista’s case presents another underwriting conce rn. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Larger firms are more vulnerable to s uits. 
B. That’s correct! The larger the firm, the more vulnerable it is to suits. Underwriters also prefer 
older, more-established organizations to relatively new firms. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. A larger firm th at is not well-establ ished is considered especially 
vulnerable to suits. 
D. This answer is incorrect. A star t-up firm is vulnerable because  it is not well-established. 
4.  
A. That’s correct! Frank’s dominan ce likely creates a groupthink m entality in which other board 
members do not carefully  examine his proposals. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The underwriter can evaluate the deci sion-making process independently 
of its results. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Frank seems to have too big a voice i n corporate decisions. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Evalua tion of dissenting viewpoints g enerally leads to well-reasoned 
decisions. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Corpora te officers are likely to high light positive aspects of their work 
and downplay the negatives. 
B. This answer is incorrect. People in these positions are not unb iased. 
C. That’s correct! As outsiders who  also deal with other organizat ions, these individuals are likely to 
have a broader, more objective perspective than corporate insid ers. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Public documents usually have some de gree of “spin” intended to cast 
the company in a f avorable light.  
86 Chapter 11 
Controlling D&O Liability Claims Part 1: General Suggestions 
Overview 
Chapter 11 provides a number of general suggestions on how to p revent directors and officers (D&O) 
claims. Insured companies can implement these suggestions thems elves and, in addition, underwriters can 
recommend that insureds apply su ch loss control practices. Chap ter 12 offers various loss control 
techniques that apply to the area of corporate governance. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
1. Identify D&O loss control techniques. 
2. Select D&O loss control techniques applicable to a particular s ituation, given relevant 
information. 
3. Recognize problems that can result from inadequate D&O loss con trol. 
Exhibit 11.1 lists these general techniques, which are discusse d in the pages that follow. 
Exhibit 11.1 
D&O Loss Control Techniques 
 Encourage active questioni ng and appropriate dissent  
 Consult with legal counsel and outside experts 
 Maintain contact with operating managers (insist on a sufficie nt flow of information) 
 Avoid embarrassing corporate actions  
 Require review of the D& O policy and application 
 Monitor insider trading  
 Investigate warning signs 
 Do not manage to artificial indicators 
Encourage Active Questioning  and Appropriate Dissent 
The chairman of the board should conduct meetings in as unbiase d a fashion as possible. The purpose of 
having a board is not necessarily to achieve unanimity of opini on, but to encourage frank, open discussion 
and the airing of alternative courses of action and viewpoints.  The board chairman must not discourage 
dissent among board members and ch allenge board members to put forth out-of-the-ordinary viewpoints. 
By discouraging a “yes man” cultu re within corporate boardrooms , the kinds of wrongdoing that have led 
to some of the largest corporat e scandals would have been more difficult to carry out.   
87 The Problem with Board Appointmen ts: Too Often a Function of Friendship 
Unfortunately, directorships are far too often given to those w ho are close personal friends of the 
company’s chairman. As a result, board members’ general busines s philosophies tend to mesh closely 
with the CEO. For this reason, t here is an inherent tendency of  board members to agr ee with the chairman 
rather than question his or her ideas and initiatives. The airi ng of differing viewpoints tends to be the 
exception rather than the rule. T o the extent possible, boards should guard against the  dangers inherent in 
“groupthink” based upon personal a ffinity, relying instead upon  true expertise and objectivity. 
Avoiding Groupthink by Appointin g an “Out of the Box” Director  
New York-based Signature Bank pr ovides an example of how one co rporation actively sought a board 
member who (likely) possesses viewpoints that differ significan tly from most other executives working 
within its particular industry. I n June 2015, the bank asked fo rmer United States Congressman Barney 
Frank to join its board of directors. Previously, in July 2009,  Congressman Frank introduced and was 
instrumental in helping to pass landmark legislation that bears  his name (“The Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Ac t”), which imposed a variety o f operational requirements on banks 
and other financial instituti ons. Given his background, it is p robable that with respect to matters 
pertaining to banking regulati on, the congressman holds opinion s unlike those of his Signature Bank 
board colleagues.  
Consult with Legal Counsel and Outside Experts 
In situations where actions mus t be taken (e.g., responding to a takeover bid) but where there is potential 
for claims arising from such actions, reliance on outside inves tment banking and/or legal counsel is 
perhaps the best method of reducing exposure and developing a s ound defense to allegations of 
wrongdoing.  
For example, if another firm mak es an offer to buy the company,  an independent investment banking firm 
can provide objective input as to its fair market value. Accept ance or rejection of the offer—based on an 
unbiased party’s assessment—can the n be used to justify managem ent’s final decision when confronted 
by a lawsuit alleging that direct ors and officers agreed to sel l the company at too low a price or, 
alternatively, that it mistaken ly rejected a buyout proposal be cause, in the board of directors’ view, the 
offering price was too low. 
Maintain Contact with Operating Managers 
Directors must guard against being insulated from the actions a nd decisions of operating managers. This 
is an admittedly difficult task, given the distance between an outside director and the company’s day-to-
day operations. There should be no hesitation in questioning me mbers of operating management about 
actions that have been taken or regarding current conditions. W hile only directors have the legal right to 
attend board meetings, operating managers should be questioned at such meetings, w here appropriate. 
“Management by Walking Around”  
In addition to their other overs ight work, directors should als o thoroughly examine the company’s day-to-
day “ground level” operations. I n effect, “management by walkin g around” is important for directors to 
do on a periodic basis. Board m embers should be curious and sho uld occasionally visit stores, factories, 
and other company offices. Simply observing how work is done, w hat the typical workplace interactions 
are like, and even asking questions of regular employees and mi d-level management can prove to be very 
insightful for directors that are  typically more detached from the actual workplace.   
88 Avoid Embarrassing Corporate Actions 
Management experts frequently advise that businesses “never do anything in private that would be 
embarrassing if revealed to the public.” For example, at one ti me it was revealed that American 
International Group (AIG) had spent nearly a half-million dolla rs to send a number of its sales executives 
to an outing at a high-end resort. Normally, this would not hav e triggered a public outcry. However, only 
a month earlier, AIG had received more than $100 billion in U.S . government funding as a means of 
saving the company from bankruptcy. This was a classic example of how a seemingly private action 
fanned the flames of public resentment—an action that encourage d investors to file claims against the 
company’s directors and officers in addition to the ones that h ad been already made at the time of the 
revelation about the resort event . An example like this shows t he effect that bad timing can have by 
amplifying an otherwise unremarkable event or action. 
Require Review of the D&O Policy and Application 
By studying both the application for D&O coverage and the polic y itself, directors and officers will have 
a better idea of the scope of act s covered by the insurance con tract. Reviews of this kind can provide a 
heightened awareness of the types of conduct that could give ri se to claims—regardless of whether 
coverage applies. In addition, the  organization’s risk manager or insurance representative should be called 
upon annually to make a detailed presentation about the firm’s D&O insurance program. This provides an 
ideal forum to address difficult points of coverage as well as to update directors and officers on the 
current state of the market for coverage. 
The Importance of the Application 
Special attention should be focu sed on two items within the app lication. First, directors and officers 
should study the documents attached to the application. This is  because insurers hav e increasingly used 
inaccuracies or outright misrepresentations in such documents a s the basis of rescission (i.e., an action 
that voids the entire policy). If need be, these documents shou ld be reviewed by a professional in the 
appropriate area of expertise be fore submission to the insurer.  
Second, board members should revi ew the claim warranty statemen t, in which the signer of the 
application is asked to assert that he or she knows of no incid ents that could produce a future claim. 
Discussions concerning this item could reveal problematic situa tions that should be immediately reported 
to the firm’s current insurer, a n action that might prevent a c laim denial under a future policy. 
Monitor Insider Trading 
One of the most dangerous compone nts of a serious securities cl ass action lawsuit is the presence of 
significant insider trading at a suspicious time and in suspici ous amounts. Referring to the classic Enron 
example, COO Jeffrey Skilling sold  massive amounts of the compa ny’s stock during the summer of 2001, 
immediately prior to the implosi on of the company’s stock in th e fall of that year. The same is true of 
former Countrywide CEO Angelo Moz ilo, who also unloaded suspici ous amounts of the stock he owned 
in the company immediately befo re it experienced a similar plun ge. 
Given the high correlation between heavy insider trading and se curities class action claims, underwriters 
often insist that the company’s insider trading policy has well -established trading “blackouts” (e.g., no 
trading is allowed for the 60 day s immediately prior to or afte r a quarterly earnings announcement) and 
“windows” (e.g., trading is only allowed during the first 60 da ys of each fiscal year). Lastly, an effective 
compliance officer who strictly enforces such rules should over see these policies.   
89 Investigate Warning Signs 
In most instances of corporate financial or operational problem s, warning signs are visible to senior 
management and directors long befo re the problem fully develops . Directors and officers should be 
vigilant in identifying those warning signs and should adequate ly respond on a timely basis.  
Such warning signs include (1) a  company entering into numerous  transactions designed for financial 
reporting purposes rather than those containing real economic s ubstance; (2) an excessive number of 
related-party transactions, suc h as large-dollar-volume sales t o subsidiaries; and (3) highly complex 
transactions of which some senio r managers and the directors di d not understand the structure, purpose, 
terms, and effect.  
Enron: A Case Study in Financial Manipulation 
A high percentage of Enron’s re venues were generated by “sales”  of assets to noncons olidated “special 
purpose entities.” These kinds of complex, off-balance sheet tr ansactions are completely lacking in 
economic substance yet create the appearance of actual revenue.  They are often a sign of intentional 
financial mismanagement and ultimately produce claims. Such act ivity requires thorough investigation. 
These and similar transactions s hould be approved by knowledgea ble, informed, and truly independent 
boards of directors, based on the advice of qualified outside a dvisers where appropriate. 
Do Not Manage to Artificial Indicators 
Public companies routinely focus on meeting analysts’ expectati ons of quarterly earnings. Regrettably, 
meeting these expectations can become an end in itself, rather than managing the co mpany to achieve 
long-run growth and profitability. As a result, an environment can be created in which personnel at all 
levels of the company are pressure d to do whatever it takes to meet these short-term artificial indicators. 
Such a mindset may encourage t he kinds of deceptive accounting practices described above. Instead, 
companies should strive to build long-term credibility and seek  to avoid unreasonable expectations by 
company constituents such as stockholders and securities analys ts.

92 Answers to Chapter 11 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. To som e extent, at least, Jack’s disr uptions have been healthy. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Jack might pop up with his outside-th e-box ideas because he is cranky, 
but his cranky ideas have been hel pful, in at least some cases.  
C. That’s correct! Exploring alternative viewpoints helps the boar d avoid the “yes man” culture that 
leads to groupthink. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Othe r board members will have a bette r opportunity to listen to and 
evaluate Jack’s ideas rather th an being forced to react on the spur of the moment. The board might 
choose to adopt some of Jack’s i deas or at least present them t o stockholders as an alternative idea 
that was carefully considered. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorr ect. Lack of any due diligence could easil y lead to allegations of wrongdoing. 
B. That’s correct! An independent i nvestment firm can provide obje ctive input on the firm’s value. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The minutes might or might not includ e any relevant information. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Upon further investigation, the board  might find that a price that 
subjectively seemed too low might  actually be a generous offer.  
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The insurer would not change the prem ium on a policy al ready in force. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Any audit premium would be based on e xposures during the policy term. 
C. This answer is incorrect. An endorsement would not be necessary  to give the insurer grounds for 
denying a claim. 
D. That’s correct! Insurers have in creasingly used inaccuracies or  outright misrepresentations in 
application documents as the basis of rescission—an action that  voids the entire policy. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The warranty does not contain exclusi ons. 
B. This answer is incorrect. It’s  not that type of a warranty. 
C. That’s correct! The person(s) signing the application asserts t hat they know of no incidents that 
could produce a future claim. Failure to report such an inciden t provides grounds for denying a 
claim that results f rom that incident. 
D. This answer is incorrect. If ind eed there were no incidents to report, that is a favorable 
underwriting sign. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The i ssue here is not e lectrical blac kouts, but trading blackouts. 
B. This answer is incorrect. During those months, Citrus can conce ntrate on frozen orange juice and 
similar products. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. The short trading window discourages insider trading. 
D. That’s correct! Because heavy insi der trading often leads to se curities class action claims, 
underwriters probably insist that Citrus Company’s insider trad ing policy has well-established 
trading “blackouts” such as this one that are strictly enforced  by an effective compliance officer.

Controlling D&O Liability Claims: Effective Corporate Governance 
Overview 
This chapter provides a detailed review of a company’s corporat e governance practices, an important part 
of public company underwriting.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
1. Recognize what is meant by “corporate governance.” 
2. Identify best practices associat ed with corporate governance. 
3. Recognize why certain practices are considered best practices. 
What Is “Corporate Governance”? 
Corporate governance is a system specifying the division of dut ies, rights, and responsibilities among 
various participants in a corpora tion, typically the board of d irectors, various committees within the board 
of directors, operating managers , and shareholders. Corporate g overnance enumerates the rules, 
guidelines, and procedures for making decisions affecting corpo rate affairs.  
Although adoption of a “best prac tices” approach to corporate g overnance provides no guarantee that a 
company will not be involved in a claim, firms that are activel y implementing such practices are less 
likely to have problems and will be better able to defend thems elves if a claim does arise. Exhibit 12.1 
lists these “best practices,” which are discussed in this chapt er. 
   
94 Exhibit 12.1 
Corporate Governance “Best Practices” 
 Assure independent decision-making on the board  
 Require a minimum lev el of stock ownership 
 Reform option-related compensation practices 
 Separate the roles of board chairman and CEO 
 Conduct CEO-free board meetings 
 Periodically evaluate director performance 
 Improve audit committee effectiveness  
 Provide directors with relevant and timely information 
 Limit time devoted to board service 
 Avoid conflicts of interest 
 Eliminate corporate board “interlock” 
Assure Independent Decision-Making on the Board 
The following actions can assure the independence of a corporat e board.  
Limit Corporate Boards to No More than Three Insiders 
If a board consists of only three insiders (typically the CEO, COO, and CFO), there will be a higher 
probability of independent decisi on-making (assuming there are at least four outside directors). This is 
true because when operating execu tives are in the minority, the y will, of course, have a minority of votes 
on any given issue or proposal.  
Assign Only Independent, Outside Di rectors to the Three Key Committees 
The audit, compensation, and no minating committees are the thre e key board committees. By assigning 
only independent directors to them, the board will be better ab le to render unbiased decisions. 
Set Mandatory Term Limits  
Directors should be required to resign after 10 years on the bo ard or at age 70, whichever comes first. 
These benchmarks help to ensure that a board member does not be come so entrenched that he or she 
begins to rubber stamp a CEO’s  initiatives rather than evaluati ng each major proposal with healthy 
skepticism. A number of corporat e governance experts refer to p lanned, periodic turnover as maintaining 
a “refreshed board.”  
Ban (or at Least Limit) Stock Sales by Dir ectors for the Duration of Their Service  
If directors are banned (or at least limited) from selling thei r shares during their tenure, they will have 
more incentive to reveal inappropriate conduct by operating man agement. This will allow them to divulge 
such improprieties without fear o f the consequences associated with short-term price declines in the 
company’s stock that may follow.  
For example, if a director feels that a company is engaging in “aggressive accounting” in an effort to 
bump up earnings, an announcement to  that effect would probably  cause a drop in the company’s share 
price, at least in the short-term. However, if a rule was in ef fect that banned sales of the company’s stock 
during a director’s tenure, the  share price would likely recove r, and the director would not be hurt  
95 financially. (Alternatively, limiting such sales to perhaps $25 0,000 each year would have essentially the 
same effect while allowing for the fact that directors may have  personal emergencies requiring them to 
raise cash by selling stock in the company.) 
Require a Minimum Level of Stock Ownership 
On a number of high-profile corporate boards, directors hold on ly small equity positions. As a result, they 
are virtually immune to the fina ncial consequences of their own  poor decisions. However, by requiring a 
minimum equity stake (e.g. $250,000), there is greater assuranc e that the interests of stockholders and 
board members will be aligned. The only exception to this rule should be for relatively new directors who 
have not served on the board long enough to build up the requis ite equity stake. (This is, in essence, the 
converse of the situation noted above, in which board members h ave too much of a stake in the 
company’s fortunes, in the short-term, at least.) 
Reform Option-Related Compensation Practices 
As already explained in this cour se, option grants are a signif icant source of claims against corporate 
directors and officers. So by bringing increased discipline to the process of option grants, there will be 
reduced temptation for directors and officers to artificially i nflate the prices of their stocks through short-
term earnings maneuvers in hop es of cashing in outsize option g ains.  
FASB Impact on Option Grant Abuses 
Under previous accounting rules, stock option grants were not t reated as an expense on a corporation’s 
income statement. This had the effect of encouraging options gr ants as part of CEO pay packages, as well 
as director and officer pay pack ages. (Instead, if such grants were treated as current expenses, it would 
have the effect of lowering a co rporation’s short-term earnings , something that few corporations prefer.)  
The rule, in turn, supplied cor porate executives with incentive —perhaps too much so—to manipulate the 
price of the corporation’s stock. Such incentive, as has been a pparent in a number of high-profile 
corporate meltdowns and subsequent directors and officers (D&O)  litigation, resulted in questionable, if 
not fraudulent, accounting practices.  
In 2004, the Financial Accountin g Standards Board (FASB) issued  a revised statement (Statement No. 
123) that mandated that employee option grants be accounted for  at fair value. As the statement details, 
the change in accounting treatment was aimed at addressing the concern that failing to expense these 
grants may result in “financial statements that do not faithful ly represent the economic transactions 
affecting the issuer, namely, the receipt and consumption of em ployee services in exchange for equity 
instruments.”  
The effect of Statement No. 123 was significant. As reported by  Steven Balsam, Seb astian O’Keefe, and 
Mark M. Wiedemer in the Journal of Accountancy (“Frontline Reac tion to FASB 123(R),” April 1, 2007), 
approximately 61 percent of surve yed companies had eliminated o r decreased their use of options at all 
levels in just over 2 years afte r the revised FASB standard. Th ese changes have been accompanied by a 
decreased incentive (and increased  transparency of financial co nsequences) for abusing stock option 
grants. 
Another advantage of “expensing” options is that this practice will produce more accurate earnings in the 
short-run.  
Specific Option-Related “Best Practices” 
The following specific procedur es have been suggested to change  the system of option granting. 
 Barring exercise of options for a relatively long period, such as 3, 5, or even 7 years  
96  Prohibiting the exercise of opti ons unless the stock meets or e xceeds some specific benchmark, 
such as equaling the annual return of the S&P 500 index 
 Awarding stock to executives that must be held for a number of years so CEOs can “win big or 
lose big” along with stockholders 
 Requiring shareholders—not simply the board of directors—to vot e on all stock option grants 
Separate the Roles of Board Chairman and CEO 
Since the wave of high-profile c orporate failures in the early 2000s, one area of corporate governance that 
has received particular attention is the question of whether th e roles of chairman of the board and CEO 
should be split. Some argue that such an arrangement provides g reater oversight of corporations and, in 
extreme cases, serves to rein in C EOs tempted to bend the rules  or even break the law.  
Split of Board Chairman and CEO Roles 
As of 2015, approximately 52 percent of S&P 500 CEOs also serve d as board chairmen, representing a 
decline of nearly 20 percent co mpared to 10 years earlier, acco rding to Spencer Stuart’s 2015 Spencer 
Stuart Board Index . This rapid trend towards a sp lit of the board chairman and CE O roles points towards 
what has already been standard p ractice in places like Canada a nd England, where a small percentage of 
CEOs also hold the position of board chairman. A continued swit ch to this system represents a sea change 
in American corporate governance. In light of investor skeptici sm and heightened demand for added 
scrutiny of corporate actions, an argument can be made for impr oved corporate governance when CEOs 
relinquish their title of “board  chairman.” Splitting the CEO a nd board chairman’s roles might help assure 
D&O underwriters that financial restatements and similar liabil ity-producing events are more likely to be 
prevented. 
Better Monitoring of CEO Performance 
Another argument in favor of divi ding these roles is that there  is an inherent conflict when the CEO is 
also chairman of the board and th e board must monitor the CEO’s  performance and hold him or her 
accountable for results. Indeed, the theoretical roles of chair man of the board and CEO call for two 
separate individuals to handle each of the two distinct roles r equired by these positions. More specifically, 
the CEO is charged with creati ng overall strategies and running  the company, whereas the chairman of 
the board is chiefly responsible for leading the board in overs eeing the company’s top management. 
When the chairman of the board a nd the CEO are the same person,  the board’s oversight role is 
compromised. Accordingly, a number of experts believe that effe ctive governance is impossible if the 
same person is responsible for d eveloping the firm’s overall st rategy and managing the business on a day-
to-day basis and charged with evaluating and, a t times, challenging those strat egies on behalf of the 
company’s owners. In their view, unless these two roles are sep arated, corporate governance will be an 
illusion.  
Board Chairman and CEO: Too Demanding for One Person? 
A number of observers feel it has become nearly impossible to e ffectively run a major corporate entity 
while, at the same time, performing all of the duties of a boar d chairman. Since the chairman’s role 
includes setting the board agenda, providing the board members with the highest-quality information, and 
facilitating communication among boa rd members and with managem ent, it is often believed that all of 
these duties, in addition to runni ng a major corporation, are s imply too much for one person. 
Appoint an Independent Lead Director: An Alternative To Splitting the Roles 
Another variation on the approach of splitting the jobs of boar d chairman and CEO is to have an 
independent “lead” director who, after each board meeting, meet s with the other independent directors.  
97 This approach provides greater oversight of the CEO and of the entire board, yet is admittedly not as 
effective as having separate individuals serving in these two p ositions. 
Conduct CEO-Free Board Meetings 
Yet another effective corporate governance practice is to perio dically hold board meetings, but without 
the presence of the company’s CEO.  
Facilitating Frank Discussions 
The value of CEO-free board meetings is that they allow board m embers, who will not often confront 
hard issues with the CEO in the room, to be more open in his or  her absence. Clearly, “executive 
sessions,” as CEO-free board meeti ngs are sometimes called, can  promote the kind of candid, open 
discussions that may not otherwise have been possible.  
Periodically Evaluate Director Performance 
The board of directors should periodically evaluate director an d officer performance and assess the extent 
to which these persons have met the standards set forth for the m.  
Areas To Evaluate 
The following are among the most important areas in which perfo rmance should be evaluated. 
 Regularity of attendance at both board and committee meetings 
 General level of preparedness 
 Capacity for asking challenging questions 
 Ability to offer creative suggestions 
 Willingness to make and take constructive criticism 
Peer performance reviews of thi s type are essential in assuring  that those serving in director and officer 
capacities are putting forth their best efforts. Although this process will sometimes hurt feelings, the 
stakes are too high for an organ ization not to receive anything  less than top performance from its directors 
and officers. 
Improve Audit Committee Effectiveness 
The audit committee is perhaps t he most important committee of the board of directors. Its key duties 
include monitoring and oversight of the following. 
1. Financial reporting and disclosure 
2. The choice of accounting policies and principles 
3. Hiring and performance evaluation of external auditors 
4. Regulatory compliance, ethics, and whistleblower hotlines 
5. The internal control process 
6. The internal audit function 
7. Risk management policies and practices 
Suggestions to enhance the comm ittee’s effectiveness include th e following.  
 Financial literacy.  Audit committees should be compo sed of at least financially li terate members 
(and preferably those with financial expertise) who can fully u nderstand and critique the  
98 company’s financial statements . In particular, the chairperson of the audit committee should be 
well steeped in financial and accounting knowledge and experien ce.  
 Independence.  Audit committee members should be  truly independent from manag ement and the 
auditors. Business, social, or ot her relationships that may imp ede the independent thinking and 
decision-making of committee members should be considered when evaluating a member’s 
qualifications for service on the audit committee.  
 Frequent meetings.  Audit committees should meet regularly and frequently (i.e., e ach month), 
not just in connection with the annual audit.  
 Auditor selection.  The audit committee—not the CFO —should have full responsibilit y for 
selecting, hiring, and terminati ng outside auditors. A periodic  turnover of auditors (or at least the 
partner in charge of the audit) is advisable.  
 Discussions with auditors.  The audit committee should discu ss annual financial statements  in 
one-on-one meetings with the com pany’s auditors, senior managem ent (e.g., the CFO), and 
internal accountants. In partic ular, the CFO should spend time with board members on the audit 
committee to verify that they ar e well versed on the unique fin ancial aspects of the business.  
 Financial reporting policies.  The audit committee should examin e very closely the financial 
reporting and accounting policies for significant transactions that can materially affect the 
company’s earnings performance for a quarter or year. The audit  committee should also verify 
that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and any other rel evant accounting rules have been 
followed.  
 Separate auditing and consulting services.  A vast majority of the major accounting firms now 
offer nonaccounting/consulting services, from which these firms  derive substantial fee income, 
often far exceeding audit-based r evenues. A number of observers  feel that the combination of 
both an audit and a consulting re lationship with the same clien t severely compromises an 
accounting firm’s objectivity in performing the annual audit. T herefore, the only meaningful 
business relationship with a com pany’s outside auditor should i nvolve its annual audit.  
 Response to complaints. The audit committee should establish procedures to receive, 
investigate, and respond to complaints or requests for confiden tial information from employees or 
others relating to the company’ s accounting or financial contro ls. 
Provide Directors with Rel evant and Timely Information 
To facilitate their work, director s need to be given informatio n that is both relevant and timely. A frequent 
complaint of directors is the increasing volume of reports bein g sent to them just prior to each meeting. 
Clearly, more is not better. An independent director who receiv es a 500-page file 3 days before the board 
meeting and who is to attend a discussion that management has s tructured around completely abstruse 
technical points is of no use in the decision-making process. I nstead, companies should strive to supply 
their boards with information p ackets that are truly pertinent to the issues on the upcoming agenda and 
manageable from the standpoint o f length. Moreover, this inform ation should be made available well in 
advance (e.g., at least 2 weeks) of each board meeting. 
Create an Adequate Support Structure 
One way to assure the relevance and timeliness of information t hey receive is to provide directors with an 
adequate support structure. Desp ite the increasing demands plac ed on them, even directors of large, 
public corporations do not always have a dedicated staff availa ble to assist them. And yet, given their 
significant and growing responsibilities (especially since pass age of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), a support 
structure can be valuable in assuring that directors have the n ecessary resources available to them.   
99 Limit Time Devoted to Board Service 
It has been estimated that approximately 278 hours per year are  required to serve as a director of a major 
corporation. Accordingly, it is  a generally accepted practice t hat a person should serve on no more than 
four corporate boards at the same time, a recommendation that t racks with Avon Products’ Corporate 
Governance Guidelines, noted b elow as an example. Undoubtedly, staying abreast of the complete scope 
of a firm’s activities is an extremely difficult task in any la rge organization. Therefore, underwriters 
should be alert for situations i n which any member of a board o f directors also sits on the boards of 
several other sizeable organiza tions or serves as an officer of  such firms. Often, the  demands that such 
activities have placed on a director make it difficult if not i mpossible to devote adequate time to preparing 
for board and committee meeti ngs. An assertion that a board mem ber had inadequate time to stay fully 
apprised of relevant corporate matters is not a valid defense t o claims against directors and officers. 
Semiretired Directors versus Di rectors with Full-Time Jobs 
It is also important to distinguish board members who have full -time jobs with other corporations from 
those that are “semiretired.” F or example, Avon Products’ Corpo rate Governance Guidelines (as of 
March 1, 2016) recommend that if a board member is the CEO of a nother public company, he or she 
should not sit on any more than two additional boards besides A von. If not the CEO of another public 
company, he or she should sit on no more than four additional b oards.  
Limiting Board Service Is a Growing Trend 
As of a 2006 survey by the executiv e search firm Heidrick & Str uggles, in conjunction with the 
University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business , 40 percent of the corporations surveyed 
had mandated limits on the number of other boards on which outs ide directors can serve. This was up 
dramatically from 2001, a year in which just 3 percent of the c orporations surveyed imposed such 
restrictions. 
Furthermore, a December 2015 ar ticle by Todd Wallack and Sacha Pfeiffer of the Boston Globe  (“Debate 
swirls on how many board directorships are enough”) stated that  the issue remains “a simmering debate 
across corporate America,” citing concerns from the president o f the National Association of Corporate 
Directors that his organizatio n’s recommended limits on the num ber of boards a director can serve may be 
outdated. At the time of the ar ticle, Institutional Shareholder  Services and Glass Lewis, two of the largest 
shareholder advisory services, h ad both lowered their recommend ed limits on the number of boards a 
director can serve from six to five.  
Avoid Conflicts of Interest 
According to Roswell B. Perkins, a  prominent New York attorney,  the most effective test of a potential 
conflict of interest is for a board member to ask, “Do I have a ny reason to prefer corporate action A to 
action B, or vice versa, that is  not a reason shared by all sto ckholders?” An affirmative answer reveals a 
conflict of interest.  
Conflicts of Interest: An Example 
John Smith, a director of the ABC property and casualty insuran ce company, is also the CEO of XYZ, a 
leading independent claims adjus ting firm. At a recent board me eting, ABC is discussing the need to hire 
an independent adjusting firm. A deluge of claims caused by a r ecent hurricane in South Florida (where 
ABC writes most of its business) h as created this situation. Gi ven these circumstances, Smith has a clear 
conflict of interest. Although hiring his firm, XYZ, would obvi ously benefit Smith, the firm may not 
necessarily be the one best suite d to ABC’s needs. Consequently , Smith can and should avoid this conflict 
of interest by, first, not being present during any of the boar d’s discussions pertaining to the hiring of an  
100 adjusting firm. Second, he should recuse himself from voting af ter the discussions have concluded and a 
single firm has been chosen. 
“Side Deals”: A Frequent Source of Conflicts  
So-called “side deals,” in which directors are frequently invol ved, are another source of conflicts of 
interest. According to Executive Compensation Advisory Services , one out of four U.S. firms is involved 
in such conflicts, the likes of w hich frequently include the fo llowing by board members, in conjunction 
with the companies on whose boards they sit. 
 Receipt of consulting or legal fees  
 Participation in lease agreements  
 Involvement in contracts to purchase or supply goods  
Obviously, such deals cast serious doubt on a director’s indepe ndence. In addition, these types of 
arrangements reflect poorly on th e company’s CE O because they c reate the perception that such 
consulting contracts are a means of quelling opposition on the board. Obviously, board members should 
not also function as consultant s, suppliers, or providers of le gal, brokerage, or investment banking 
services.  
Eliminate Corporate Board “Interlock” 
Related to the issue of conflicts of interest is the fact that there is a high percentage of “overlap” between 
the board members of many major  corporations. Such overlap, als o known as “interlock,” occurs when 
two (or more) board members also sit together on another corpor ate board.  
Board Interlock: Potential for Quid Pro Quo Deals 
The problem with board interlock is the potential for quid pro quo deals, especially when CEOs serve on 
each other’s boards. According to  New York University professor  Lawrence White, “Anytime you have 
two guys sitting on at least two boards, there’s room for horse  trading.” While corporate interlock does 
not necessarily create conflicts of interest, it does increase the potential for the kinds of acts that could 
encourage claims against directors and officers.  
Proving direct damage to shareholders from board interlock is d ifficult. Yet, if a board member rubber 
stamps a business decision that turns out to be a bad move and costs the company money, the question 
arises as to whether the directors made a mistake or whether th ey had ulterior motives.  
The Dangers of Board In terlock: An Example 
John Smith, who is the CEO of the Ajax Corporation, sits on bot h the board and compensation committee 
of the National Motors Corporati on. Mary Jones, National Motors ’ CEO, sits on both Ajax’s board and 
compensation committee. In this s ituation, it is quite obvious that each can assist the other in garnering 
maximum pay packages as CEO’s of their respective organizations .  
Exhibit 12.2 provides a case study of how the structure of one board of directors appeared to be burdened 
with (1) conflicts of interest, (2) board interlock, and (3) ex cessive time commitment to other boards.  
101 Exhibit 12.2 
American Airlines: A Case Study in Board Interlock 
On May 9–15, 2003, the Dallas Business Journal  reported that Anne McNa mara, who retired in 
January as general counsel for Am erican Airlines (AMR), is marr ied to board member Philip 
Purcell, chairman and CEO of Morga n Stanley. As indicated in AM R’s 2002 proxy statement, 
Morgan Stanley supplied financial services to AMR. According to  Gavin Anderson of New York-
based Governance Metri cs International, Inc., “We wouldn’t rega rd Mr. Purcell as independent.”  
Another potential problem is tha t eight AMR directors sit on fo ur or more boards. This exceeds 
the rule of thumb that a person who is employed on a full-time basis should sit on only one other 
board, while those not employed should serve on a maximum of fo ur boards. (One member, 
Michael Miles, serves on seven boards in addition to AMR.)  
A third potential problem is the degree of interlock between bo ard members. Specifically, Miles 
and ex-AMR CEO Don Carty sit on Sears Roebuck’s board; Miles, P urcell, and Edward Brennan 
work together on Morgan Stanley ’s; Miles and Carty are on Dell Computer’s; Brennan and Miles 
are part of Allstate Insurance Co mpany’s; and Earl Graves and J udith Rodin serve on Aetna 
Insurance Company’s board.

104 Chapter 13 
Private Company D&O Liability Exposures 
Overview 
This chapter provides an overvie w of the liability exposures fa ced by the directors and officers of private 
companies, the kinds of claims m ade against private companies, and the reasons that private companies 
purchase directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
 Recognize the distinctive features of private companies and ide ntify three types of privately held 
companies. 
 Identify the differences between  private companies’ financial r eporting requirements and those of 
public companies. 
 Recognize the types of claims co mmonly made against private com panies. 
 Identify sound reasons why a priv ate company should purchase D& O insurance. 
Types of Private Companies 
There are three types of p rivately held companies. 
 Sole proprietorship.  This is a business owned by a s ingle person. Sole proprietorsh ips may be 
operated solely by the owner or m ay employ others. The owner of  the business has total and 
unlimited personal liability for th e debts incurred by the busi ness. Sole proprietorships are 
frequently small businesses (i.e ., those with less than $1 mill ion a year in annual revenues). 
 Partnership.  A partnership is an unincorporated arrangement in which two or  more people own a 
business. Each partner has total and unlimited personal liabili ty for the debts incurred by the 
partnership. There are three types of partnerships: (1) general  partnerships, (2) limited 
partnerships, and (3) limite d liability partnerships. 
 Corporation.  A corporation is an entity havi ng a legal existence separate f rom its owners. The 
owners have no personal liability for the debts and liabilities  incurred by the corporation. A 
business corporation is owned b y multiple shareholders and is o verseen by a board of directors, 
which hires the firm’s managerial staff. A corporation may be p rivately held or publicly traded.  
Privately Held Corporations 
A privately held corporation is one that (1) is owned by a rela tively small number of shareholders and (2) 
does not offer its stock for trade on one of the major stock ex changes, such as the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) or the National Association of Securities Deale rs Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). 
Instead, the company’s stock is offered for sale, owned, and tr aded privately, often by (1) family 
members; (2) a small group of investors; or (3) executives, man agers, or employees at the company.  
105 In 2015, Forbes’ list of the 216 largest privately held compani es generated $1.637 trillion in revenues (the 
U.S. economy’s gross domestic p roduct was roughly $17.42 trilli on in 2014). 
Largest Privately Held Companies 
Some of the largest, most recogni zable privately held companies  in the United States include Koch 
Industries, Bechtel, Cargill, Dell, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ern st & Young, Publix, Albertsons, Love’s 
Travel Stops & Country Stor es, H-E-B Grocery, and Mars. 
Financial Reporting and  Other Requirements 
Privately held companies have fewer and generally less extensiv e reporting requirements (e.g., annual 
reports, quarterly financial reports that must be filed with th e federal government) compared to publicly 
traded companies. The most important difference in reporting re quirements is that in the United States, 
privately held companies—unlike publicly held companies—are not  required to report or publish their 
financial statements.  
Privately held companies also so metimes have restrictions on th e total number of shareholders they may 
have. For example, Section 501 of  the Jumpstart Our Business St artups Act of 2012 makes a privately 
held company subject to public c ompany reporting requirements i f it has total assets over $10 million and 
2,000 or more shareholders. 
Specific Types of Claims Made Against Private Companies 
The following section describes so me of the more common types o f claims made against private 
companies, including shareholder claims and claims from miscell aneous entities.  
Shareholder Claims 
One of the great misconceptions s urrounding private company D&O  insurance coverage is that because 
private companies do not face the prospect of shareholder class  action litigation, they do not have an 
exposure to claims involving shareholders.  
The Three Myths of Private Com pany Securities and Securities Cl aims 
The term “securities” refers to (1) equity securities, otherwis e known as shares of stock in the company, 
and (2) debt securities, also called bonds issued by a company,  which represent an obligation for the 
company to repay the pur chasers of such bonds.  
Three myths are associated with  private company securities. 
 Private companies do not issue securities to the public. 
 Private companies are not subject to U.S. securities laws. 
 Private company directors and officers are held to lower conduc t standards compared to directors 
and officers in public companies and, therefore, would not even  be liable for securities claims. 
The following sections will explain—and explode—these myths. 
Private Companies Do Issue Securities to the Public 
Admittedly, private companies do not issue equity  securities to the general public. However, they do issue 
equity securities to small groups of investors in what are know n as private placements  (typically to 
investment banks and wealthy individuals). In addition, larger private companies routinely issue debt 
securities (i.e., bonds) to the public. If, for example, such a  company were to default on these bonds, it is 
likely that a class action lawsu it against the company would fo llow.  
106 Private Companies Are Subjec t to U.S. Securities Laws 
Private companies are indeed subject to such laws, despite the fact that private companies are generally 
exempt from having to register  their securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC). 
These exemptions apply when debt securities are issued to the p ublic. The exemptions also apply to 
private placements  (i.e., equity securities offered to a limited number of invest ors but not to the public). 
But simply because the company is not required to register  the private placement with the SEC does not 
exempt the company from having to comply with  federal securities laws. If , for example, a prospectus 
describing an offer of a private ly held company’s shares contai ned fraudulent misrepresentations about 
the company (e.g., the prospectus vastly inflated the extent of  the firm’s profits during the preceding 5 
years), the directors and officers of the company could be held  liable because federal securities laws 
require that information contained in securities prospectuses b e truthful.  
Private Company Directors and Officers Are Held to the Same Conduct Standards as 
Directors and Officers in Public Companies  
The case of Pereira v. Farace , 413 F.3d 330 (2d Cir. N.Y. 2005), which was decided in 2005, definitively 
established this principle. The case involved circumstances sim ilar to those in Tyco International, where 
former CEO Dennis Kozlowski was convicted of looting the compan y. In Pereira , the judge found that 
the board of directors was dere lict in its duties in failing to  detect large-scale embezzlement by its own 
CEO. Because of the losses the co mpany suffered, its shareholde rs sued the company’s directors and 
officers. The latter were found liable for the loss the shareho lders sustained, despite the board’s 
contention that it was being he ld to standards of conduct requi red of public corporations (which the court 
deemed applicable). 
Claims by Minority Shareholders 
In reality, claims by minority shareholders pose an even greate r threat to private company directors than 
do claims from common shareholders of a large public company. T his is because, compared to common 
shareholders of a public company , minority shareholders often h ave better access to the inner workings of 
the business. Consequently, minor ity shareholders, many of whom  are employees with day-to-day 
knowledge of the private company’ s daily activities, are better  able to uncover director/officer 
malfeasance about which they ofte n have more detailed informati on, thereby helping make such 
allegations “stick.”  
Claims Associated with Private Placements 
As already mentioned, even if a  company’s securities are exempt  from SEC registration, the company can 
still be sued for misrepresentation or other securities violati ons when it issues securities to investors by 
means of a private placement. Just like shares offered to the g eneral public by a public company, private 
placements require the company to issue what is known as an offering statement or prospectus,  a 
document setting forth the nature of the company’s operations, as well as its financial statements, and the 
specific purpose for which the funds being raised will be used.  Purchasers of private placements can use 
false statements in such documents as a “road map” for making c laim allegations again st the directors and 
officers of private companies.  
Claims by Miscellaneous Entities 
A number of nonshareholder/misce llaneous entities routinely bri ng claims against private company 
directors and officers. Such entities include competitors, gove rnment agencies and regulators, creditors, 
customers, and vendors.  
107 Competitors 
Allegations brought by a competito r against a private company’s  directors and officers can include (1) 
interference with contractual re lationships, (2) misappropriati on of trade secrets, (3) 
fraud/misrepresentation, and (4) unlawful access to stored info rmation.  
Government Agencies and Regulators 
A common source of claims stemming from government agencies and  regulators are those related to 
antitrust lawsuits and/or price fixing allegations. These claim s may arise if it is perceived that a private 
company, along with its competitors, conspired to “set” prices for a given industry in a concentrated 
location.  
Creditors 
Creditors, on the other hand, mos t often allege loan fraud in t he claims that they have brought against 
privately held companies. Claims of this sort may arise, for ex ample, if an executive of a privately held 
company falsified a loan application, resulting in a default th at would have otherwise been more 
foreseeable.  
Customers 
A common example of a customer claim against a privately held c ompany is the allegation that the 
company did not deliver its product on a timely basis and/or in  accordance with a written delivery 
contract, causing the customer claimant to lose business from i ts own customers as a result.  
Vendors 
Vendor claims may arise when the  privately-held organization pu rchases goods from a vendor despite 
being aware of its own poor financial condition, resulting in t he privately held company’s failure to honor 
its obligations when paym ent is eventually due.  
Statistics Related to Private Compan y Director and Officer Liability 
Chubb’s “2013 Private Company Risk Survey” offers many insights  into the type, frequency, and severity 
of litigation levied against private company directors and offi cers. Some of the particularly notable 
statistics from the survey are included below. 
 In the 10 years prior to the survey, 27 percent of private comp anies were affected by directors and 
officers claims (only 6 percent less than public companies). 
 In the same time period, the mos t common types of directors and  officers claims against private 
companies were (1) employment-related, (2) derivative sharehold er/investor suits, (3) direct 
shareholder/investor suits, (4) regulatory, and (5) fiduciary. 
 The average total cost of a di rector and officer liability even t to a private company was $697,902 
(including judgments, settleme nts, fines, and legal fees). 
 25 percent of private companies were likely to be involved in a  major acquisition/merger/sale in 
the year immediately following th e survey (indicating the high degree to which private companies 
are exposed to claims). 
 60 percent of private companies lacked a published corporate go vernance program. 
 Only 28 percent of private com panies purchase D&O liability ins urance.  
108 Why Private Companies Purchase D&O Insurance 
Private companies purchase D&O insurance for a variety of reaso ns, both similar to and different from 
the reasons that motivate public companies to do the same. Some  of the more prominent reasons are 
discussed below.  
Need To Attract Managerial/Board Talent and Expertise 
Increasingly, people who are being asked to serve on the boards  of privately held corporations have 
become aware of the threats to their personal assets that claim s against them can pose. This is because 
claims against corporate directors and officers have received i ncreasing amounts of publicity in the 
media—in addition to the fact that both their frequency as well  as their severity have consistently risen.  
Accordingly, if a private comp any has not purchased D&O insuran ce, otherwise qualified individuals 
may be reluctant to serve on the boards of directors at such fi rms.  
Protection for Directors’ and Officers’ Personal Assets 
Directors and officers liability insurance can protect the pers onal assets of private company directors and 
officers if they are sued during the course of their service.  
Although corporate bylaws and stat e laws may appear to require that companies indemnify their directors 
and officers in the event of a lawsuit, this may not be the cas e in certain situations.  
One reason that indemnification might not be available for priv ate company directors and officers could 
be that the company is financia lly unable to provide such indem nification. Insolvency and/or bankruptcy, 
scenarios that are typically even more of a concern for private  companies than public companies, 
frequently result in a company’s financial inability to honor i ts legal obligations to indemnify its directors 
and officers.  
Derivative lawsuits present anot her situation in which indemnif ication may not be available for private 
company directors and officers. These lawsuits, due to the fact  that they are brought on behalf of the 
corporation, reward any damages to the corporation itself, mean ing the damages are not indemnifiable 
under corporate bylaws. 
In light of the above situations i n which indemnification is no t available, a private company D&O policy 
is important in order to protect the personal assets of directo rs and officers. This importance is 
underscored by the fact that virtually no personal umbrella lia bility policies will afford coverage for 
service on for-profit boards of directors, contrary to commonly  held beliefs regarding the applicability of 
these policies. (Note, however, t hat coverage of nonprofit boar d service is often available by endorsement 
to personal umbrella policies.)  
Protection for the Company’s Balance Sheet 
Unlike large public companies, in the absence of insurance cove rage, most small businesses do not have 
the financial wherewithal to f und major litigation and/or cover  large settlements and judgments out of 
their operating capital.  
Even if a company can pay a settlement or judgment—along with the costs of defense—s uch payments 
are likely to leave the firm in an impaired financial condition .  
For these reasons, having D&O coverage in place may mean the di fference between survival and failure 
for many privately held organizations, much like having a prope rty policy may determine whether a 
company is eventually able to resume operations after a major p hysical loss.   
109 Advantages When an Insured Private Company Goes Public 
Although the majority of privately held companies never go publ ic, those that do enjoy the following 
benefits from having bought directors and officers coverage as a private company. 
 The organization will be able to obtain broader coverage. 
 Coverage will come at a lower price compared to a company that never had a D&O policy in 
place while it was privately held.  
For the privately held firm that is considering going public, t he time to develop a relationship with an 
underwriter is while the organization is  still a private company . A competent D&O liability underwriter 
will or certainly should have doub ts about a company that decid es to go public but had never previously 
purchased coverage. The essence of any directors and officers r isk is the extent of knowledge, ability, and 
business acumen possessed by the i ndividuals who ma nage the com pany, and an omission of this sort 
should give underwriters pause a bout such a company’s insurabil ity.  
New public companies also face higher-than-average potential fo r claims, yet another reason for an 
underwriter’s reluctance to cover a first-time buyer of a direc tors and officers liability policy. One reason 
for this higher-than-average pot ential for claims is the variet y of problems that can arise when filing an 
offering statement with the SEC . Since these statements reveal a significant amount of information about 
the company that is relevant to investors, claims may allege th at the information presented was 
misleading or deliberately false, leading to an erroneous inves tment. 
Another cause of increased claim potential is the elevated pres sure for continuous earnings growth that 
has become almost a requirement for publicly held businesses. S ince new public companies may not have 
faced this pressure from investors when they were still private ly held, their directors and officers may 
now be more at risk of using questionable tactics (often accoun ting-based) to inflate earnings and relieve 
“earnings pressure,” eventually r esulting in shareholder claims . 
For the preceding reasons, an alr eady insured private company m ay be better suited to prove to an 
underwriter its awareness and management of directors and offic ers liability issues, therefore increasing 
the likelihood of securing broader coverage at a reasonable pri ce.

Nonprofit Organization D&O Liability Exposures 
Overview 
This chapter provides an overvie w of nonprofit organization exp osures by discussing (1) the nature of 
nonprofit organizations, (2) the duties owed by directors and o fficers, (3) the types of claims against 
organizations of this type, (4) t he statutory protections again st liability, and (5) the underwriting 
considerations relevant to nonprofit organizations. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to do the fol lowing. 
 Recognize how nonprofit organizations differ from for-profit bu sinesses. 
 Identify the distinctions among various types of nonprofits. 
 Identify the duties owed by directors and officers of nonprofit  organizations, and recognize 
situations in which those duties might have been breached. 
 Identify the specific types of claims commonly made against non profit organizations. 
 Identify the statutory provisions that protect nonprofits’ dire ctors and officers against liability. 
 Recognize the criteria underwrite rs consider when insuring dire ctors and officers (D&O) 
insurance on a nonprofit organization. 
The Nature of Nonprofit Organizations 
More than 1 million nonprofit cor porations exist in the United States. There are numerous types of 
nonprofit organizations ranging in degree of size, sophisticati on, and purpose. Nonprofits run the gamut 
in size from large charities a nd foundations to little league o rganizations, in sophistication from 
universities to neighborhood asso ciations, and in purpose from self-interested professional associations to 
philanthropic missionary societies.  
Following is a representative list of some of the many types of  nonprofit organizations (also termed not-
for-profit organizations, tru sts, cooperatives, foundations, or  endowments) for whose directors and 
officers commercial insurance policies have provided liability coverage. 
 Alumni associations 
 Animal welfare/humane societies 
 Arts organizations (e.g., galle ries, art institutes, museums, p erforming arts, cultural centers, 
theaters) 
 Big Brothers/Big Sisters Clubs 
 Boys and Girls Clubs  
114  Chambers of commerce 
 Churches and religious organizations 
 Clubs (e.g., gun, sporting, dinner/social) 
 Fairs and exhibitions 
 Food banks/emergency shelters 
 Foundations 
 Historical/genealogical societies 
 Home owners’ organizations (e. g., associations for condominiums , co-ops) 
 Libraries  
 Nature conservation groups 
 Private primary/secondary schools (K–12) 
 Public broadcasting stations 
 Social services agencies 
 Trade and professional associations 
 United Way agencies 
 YMCAs/YWCAs 
 Youth sports organizations (e.g., little leagues) 
 Zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens 
Source: Chubb Insurance Company   
Nonprofit organizations are distinguished from for-profit corpo rations by virtue of the fact that the former 
do not distribute their surplus  funds to owners or shareholders . Instead, nonprofits use such funds to 
achieve the organization’s goals. Another distinctive feature o f nonprofit organizations is that they are 
exempt from both income and property taxation. 
The Lack of Ownership 
Nonprofit organizations have no ow ners. Rather, they have board s of directors. As a result, persons who 
serve on such boards are unable to sell ownership shares of the  nonprofit because none exist.  
Executive and Employee Compensation 
Some nonprofits pay their execu tives, middle management, and em ployees. Others employ unpaid 
volunteers. In some nonprofit organizations, even executives ma y work for no or limited compensation. 
However, executive compensation structures of large nonprofit o rganizations have increasingly mirrored 
those found within for-profit organizations.  
Tax Treatment  
Nonprofits are exempt from federa l, state, and local taxation i f they are organized and operated 
exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, public safet y, literary, educational, p revention of cruelty to 
children or animals, and/or devel oping national or internationa l sports purposes.   
115 Organized under State Law 
Nonprofit organizations are organ ized under state law. A number  of states give nonprofit organizations 
immunity from tort liability, and still other states limit tort  liability by enactment of a damage cap.  
Individual states define nonprof its differently. A common diffe rentiation is found between organizations 
not operated for profit and wit hout charitable goals (e.g. a sp orts or professional association), as opposed 
to charitable associations. This  distinction is made in order t o determine the specific legal rights and 
privileges the different types of nonprofit organizations will be given. 
501(c): The Standard for Nonprofits 
A significant number of nonprofit corporations in the United St ates are set up under Section 501(c) of the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This law specifies 29 different typ es of nonprofit organizations that are 
exempt from some types of federal income taxes. Many state laws  also specify the types of nonprofit 
organizations that are exempt from state taxes. Exhibit 14.1 no tes the 29 different types of organizations 
enumerated in Section 501(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)).

117 Three Common Types of Nonprofit Organizations 
The Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987), frequently used as a basis for classifying nonprofit 
organizations, defines three types of nonprofit “corporations”:  (1) public benefit corporations, (2) 
religious corporations, and (3) mu tual benefit corporations.  
The Public Benefit Corporation 
The public benefit corporation is  analogous to traditional char ities formed for public or charitable 
purposes and includes colleges, universities, and private schoo ls. A public benefit corporation is 
organized to benefit the general segment of society whether or not the members of the segment participate 
in controlling and maintaining th e institution. A public benefi t corporation may also be one that offers a 
service or product that is not offered by or for for-profit cor porations (e.g. museums, libraries, civil 
groups, hospitals, and schools.  
Public benefit corporations usua lly have no members (or members  with limited voting rights). Therefore, 
directors and officers of such corporations generally are seen as serving the public as a matter of trust. 
Thus, such corporations are, to a certain degree, more regulate d than other types of nonprofits. 
The Religious Corporation 
Religious corporations are organi zed primarily or exclusively f or religious purposes and not for private 
inurement. Religious corporati ons are substantia lly less regula ted than public benefit corporations, 
meaning directors and officers ar e held to a somewhat lower sta ndard of loyalty than those of a public 
benefit corporation.  
The Mutual Benefit Corporation 
The hallmark of a mutual benefit corporation is that it is form ed primarily to serve its members. These 
corporations tend to feature many attributes similar to for-pro fit corporations. In fact, other than laws 
prohibiting mutual benefit corporations from distributing profi ts to their members, a number of these 
corporations may operate almost identically to their for-profit  counterparts.  
Examples of mutual benefit cor porations include professional an d trade associations, condominium 
associations, and nursing homes. 
Duties Owed by Directors and Officers of Nonprofit Organization s 
In many instances, issues involving the duties of loyalty and c are owed by nonprofit directors and officers 
are decided using trust principles, leading to a heightened sta ndard of care and loyalty owed by directors 
and officers. 
Duty of Care 
In most states, directors and officers of nonprofits are subjec t to the same standard of care as directors and 
officers of for-profits, which i s the duty of each to exercise his or her judgment as a reasonably prudent 
person in similar circumstances would. Examples of breaches of the duty of care include the following. 
 A church secretary sued the members of the church’s governing b oard, alleging that the minister 
had sexually imposed on her and that the trustees were negligen t in selecting the minister and in 
failing to supervise his activities. 
 Directors allegedly authorized an organization to become involv ed in attempts to influence 
legislation that was beneficial to the organization. However, s uch activities jeopardized the 
organization’s tax-exempt status . Members sued the directors an d officers as a result of such 
actions.   
118  Directors of a charitable organization failed to either invest $500,000 of contributions it received 
from donors or put them to actual use. Instead, the directors p laced the contributions in a 
noninterest-bearing checking account for 5 years. The directors  were required to pay the interest 
that should have been received fro m a relatively safe investmen t. 
Duty of Loyalty 
The duty of loyalty owed by directors and officers of nonprofit  corporations includes the duty to avoid 
conflicts of interest, avoid in terference with corporate opport unity, and keep the confidence of the 
corporation. Exhibit 14.2 shows examples of the types of claims  that may arise from a breach of the duty 
of loyalty.  
Exhibit 14.2 
Representative Claims Resulting from a Breach of the Duty of Lo yalty 
 A trustee pledged assets of a c haritable trust to obtain a per sonal loan. Under California law, 
trustees are strictly prohibited  from self-dealing, and the tru stee was held liable. 
 A nonprofit organization was us ed as a busines s conduit throug h which the chairman of the 
board of the organization persona lly profited. A creditor of th e organization was permitted to 
recover from the chairman. 
 A charitable hospital corporat ion owned a parcel of land adjac ent to the hospital. The hospital 
then sold the land to a corpora tion owned by one of the hospita l’s trustees. The trustee then 
used the land to build an apartment and office building. The co urt held that these facts 
constituted a conflict of inter est and awarded damages to the h ospital as a result.  
 A former president of a nonprofi t association attempted to pur chase land on which the 
organization’s clubhouse was loca ted to build condominiums on t he land. Members of the 
association successfully sued to block the sale. 
 The trustee of a hospital corp oration, who was also the corpor ation’s attorney, was paid a 
finder’s fee in connection with a hospital transaction. A lawsu it was successful in preventing 
the attorney from receiving the finder’s fee. 
   
119 Duty of Obedience 
Directors and officers are require d to perform their duties in accordance with applicable statutes and 
within the terms of the organiza tion’s charter. Directors and o fficers must also obey a variety of laws that 
may impose direct liability on th em for wrongful conduct. Examp les of suits from statutorily imposed 
liability on nonprofit directors and officers are shown in Exhi bit 14.3. 
Exhibit 14.3 
Examples of Statutorily Imposed Liability 
 EPL suits 
 Antitrust suits 
 Copyright/patent suits 
 Employee Retirement Income S ecurity Act (ERISA) suits 
 Pollution suits 
 Physician credentialing suits 
 Securities lawsuits 
 Suits under miscellan eous state statutes 
Duties Owed to Members 
Nonprofit corporations generally do not have a class of persons  with a sufficiently significant financial 
interest in the operation of the  corporation to bring a derivat ive or class action suit. However, where a 
nonprofit corporation does have members, the directors and officers do have duties to the m and may be 
liable for breaches of those duties. These duties are generally  encompassed within the general duties of 
loyalty and due care owed t o the corporation itself. 
Duties Owed to Employees 
For directors and officers of nonprofit corporations, employee- related claims are the leading source of 
exposure, according to a 2011 re port from Zurich American Insur ance Company (“The Liability 
Exposures of Nonprofit Board Members”). In fact, according to N onprofits Insurance Alliance Group’s 
compilation of over 1,500 directors and officers claims against  nonprofits from 2005 through 2014, 94 
percent of all claims costs ori ginated from employee-related cl aims. These claims may arise as a result of 
wrongful acts while hiring, promoting, or terminating employees .  
It should be noted, however, tha t nonprofits with fewer than a certain number of employees and certain 
types of nonprofit organizations that are considered “private m embership clubs” may be exempt from 
some federal employment statut es (e.g., the Americans with Disa bilities Act of 1990 does not apply to 
employers with less than 15 employees or to private clubs, whil e the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967 does not apply to emp loyers with less than 20 emplo yees).  
Duties to the General Public 
Nonprofit organizations must abide by the criminal and civil la ws of the federal and state government 
regarding duties owed to the ge neral public. Civil actions ofte n directed against nonprofit corporations 
and their directors and officers include common law fraud, brea ch of contract, and all varieties of torts, 
including wrongful death or personal injury, negligent hiring a nd supervision, and interference with 
contract or prospective advantage of third parties.   
120 Specific Types of Claims Made Against Nonprofit Organizations 
Public benefit, religious, and m utual benefit corporations each  face distinct types of claims to which they 
are susceptible.  
Public Benefit Corporations 
As discussed, directors of public  benefit corporations are ofte n held to a “trustee” standard, whereby the 
director/officer must exercise a degree of care that is higher than simply avoiding ordinary negligence. 
One reason for this is that many public benefit corporations op erate in a “quasi-governmental” capacity 
and are therefore subject to special rules and procedures. Quas i-governmental organizations are partially, 
but not entirely, funded by government and are considered impor tant in the functioning of society (e.g., 
Fannie Mae, or the Federal Nati onal Mortgage Association).  
Another reason for the higher standard of care is that members of the corporation (if any) and members of 
the general public have traditionally had no standing to sue, a nd thus, only the state’s attorney general can 
do so. Without a higher standard  of care, and with a minimal th reat of lawsuits, public benefit 
corporations would potentially l ack the necessary incentive to act responsibly.  
Denial/Termination of Tenure Claims  
One troubling type of claim for public benefit nonprofit corpor ations, specifically colleges and 
universities, is one alleging that there was an unjust denial o f tenure for a professor. This denial of tenure 
may be despite the fact that th e professor has met certain stip ulated requirements. Claims may also arise 
when a tenured professor is termi nated and he or she alleges th at the institution was not legally permitted 
to do so. Tenure is regarded as “permanent” employment, and ten ured professors may only be terminated 
for adequate and limited causes.  
University of Pa. v. EEOC, 493 U.S. 182 (1990), was an important case in terms of its impa ct on the 
potential for tenure-related clai ms. In short, the Equal Employ ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 
sought peer-review documents and materials regarding the disput ed denial of tenure for a female Asian-
American associate professor, which the Wharton School of Busin ess refused to provide. In siding with 
the EEOC, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the univer sity had no special privilege of 
“academic freedom” to prevent the EEOC from accessing the peer- review records. The decision lessened 
the difficulty of proof for pro fessors alleging discriminatory tenure decisions. Nevertheless, claims of 
sexist or racist denial/terminati on of tenure have continually occurred since the ruling.  
Religious Corporations 
Religious corporations, like a ll corporations, face potentially  serious liability in several areas. Although 
the exposures below have been inc reasingly covered by stand-alo ne policies unique to the exposure, the 
potential remains for parallel proceedings against directors of  religious organizations; claims that could 
fall under a nonprofit directors and officers liability policy.   
Liability from Donors 
As with most nonprofits that rely  on donations to fund their op erations, religious organizations are 
exposed to liability from potential allegations of misappropria tion of donor funds. This is especially true 
given the rise of “megachurches” (churches with average weekly attendance of 2,000 persons or more at 
their worship services) and othe r large religious facilities th at feature high seating capacities, the ability to 
host a variety of recreational a nd social events, and often tim es multiple “campuses” with cutting-edge 
services provided for members. According to a September 2012 ar ticle by Thom S. Rainer in The 
Christian Post , “Seven Updated Tre nds on Megachurches in America”, the number  of megachurches in 
the United States had grown from 600 in 2000 to 1,600 in 2012. Often times, the lavish features that can  
121 be characteristic of religious facilities like these may lead t o questions of whether donations are being 
used appropriately to fund the organization’s actual religious mission.  
Liability from Counseling and Potential Child Abuse 
Religious organizations are uni quely situated to significantly impact the personal lives of their members. 
Unfortunately, activities like c ounseling and caring for childr en bring serious liability concerns to the 
forefront.  
With increasing frequency, employees of religious corporations have been accused of negligent or 
abusive counseling. If a tort of negligent counseling is establ ished, it is likely that suits against directors 
and officers alleging negligent hiring or failure to establish proper training programs will follow. 
Furthermore, potential liability for failure to report suspecte d abuse or danger to third parties that may 
become apparent during counseling sessions is another concern.  
Additionally, religious organi zations that undertake some form of child care services face exposures 
associated with alleged child a buse. Much like the liability as sociated with counseling, discussed above, 
negligent hiring leading to alleged child abuse is one of the p rimary exposures for directors and officers 
of religious organizations. 
Notably, these exposures are ofte n times specifically excluded from nonprofit directors and officers 
liability coverage, whether by de finition of “bodily injury” or  by endorsement. Religious organizations 
seeking coverage for their directors and officers should theref ore make extensive efforts to determine 
whether coverage exists for th ese exposures, in addition to mak ing efforts to minimize potential liability.  
Mutual Benefit Corporations 
Certain liability exposures are particularly relevant for direc tors and officers of mutual benefit 
corporations, particularly tho se exposures related to membershi p admission discrimination and antitrust 
liability.  
Liability for Membership A dmission Discrimination 
Mutual benefit corporations can  be susceptible to suits by thos e who wish to become members, but feel 
they are unable to do so due to discriminatory membership polic ies. Such lawsuits are expensive to 
defend and may be pleaded so as to involve directors and office rs as the designers of the club’s 
discriminatory policies. Given t hese circumstances, underwriter s carefully examine membership 
qualifications when they analyze applications submitted by priv ate clubs.  
Antitrust Liability  
Another area of exposure to the directors and officers of mutua l benefit corporations is the antitrust 
lawsuit. Nonprofit corporations o f this type, which include tra de and professional societies and 
cooperatives, can be targets of antitrust claims, just as for-p rofit corporations may be. Suits often involve 
agreements regarding price-fixi ng through minimum or maximum fe es or group boycotts, activities that 
are considered per se violati ons of federal antitrust laws and are punishable without proof of harm (in 
civil lawsuits) or proof of crim inal intent (in criminal action s). Directors and officers may face both 
criminal and civil liability, and the combination of defense co sts and damages can prove to be very 
serious.  
Statutory Protections  Against Liability 
Because increased litigation against directors and officers of nonprofit corporations has affected the 
willingness of such persons to ser ve on boards or as officers o f nonprofit corporations (particularly those 
directors and officers who serve without compensation), virtual ly every state has adopted legislation to  
122 limit legal liability of volunteer directors and officers under  state law, reduce the threat of litigation, and 
promote the service of volunteers on nonprofits.  
However, the limitation of liability for volunteer directors an d officers is not without exception. 
According to Nonprofit Risk Management Center’s “State Liabilit y Laws for Charitable Organizations 
and Volunteers—4th Edition,” updated in December 2009, some of the more notable exceptions to state 
volunteer immunity statutes include the following. 
 Exceptions eliminating protection for volunteer conduct found t o be willful or wanton 
 Exceptions for gross negligence on the part of the volunteer 
 Exceptions for wrongful acts committed while operating a motor vehicle 
 Exceptions for fraud or fiduciary misconduct 
 Exceptions for actions brought b y an attorney general or other state official 
 Exceptions for the delivery of certain professional services 
 Exceptions for knowing violation of the law 
There is little consistency or uniformity among state laws that  provide protection for volunteers. 
However, the Volunteer Protection Act, signed into federal law in 1997, addressed the same issue of 
volunteer immunity and sought to pr ovide additional consistency .  
Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 
The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 provides immunity from tor t claims that might be filed against 
volunteers of nonprofit organizations. Generally, the Act prote cts volunteers from liability if they are (1) 
volunteering for a nonprofit organization, school, or other gov ernment agency for little or no 
compensation; (2) acting in the scope of volunteer duties; and (3) negligent or accu sed of negligence. 
However, the Act does not provide immunity for the organization  itself. 
The Act also includes several qualifications that must be met i n order for volunteers to maintain their 
immunity. Some examples of exceptions to the Act (i.e., situati ons in which immunity would not be 
provided to volunteers) include the following. 
 Harm that took place because the volunteer acted in an extremel y negligent or deliberately 
criminal manner 
 A volunteer activity that required a license or certification i n the state in question and for which 
the volunteer did not have the required credentials 
 A volunteer under the influence of drugs or alcohol 
 Harm due to the volunteer’s operation of a motor vehicle 
The above requirements and excep tions were reported in a July 2 010 fact sheet from ChangeLab 
Solutions titled “Volunteers and Liability: The Federal Volunte er Protection Act.” Given the numerous 
exceptions and qualifications to st ate and federal law that aff ect whether nonprofit organizations, their 
directors and officers, employees, and volunteers may be exempt  from liability, nonprofits are well 
advised to purchase liability c overage, despite any appearance of “immunity.”  
Underwriting Nonprofit Organizations 
The following list provides examples of some of the unique face ts of various nonprofit organizations that 
underwriters examine when evalua ting their directors and office rs exposures. 
 Finances  
123  Fund-raising activities and outside grants 
 Advice-rendering/professional services 
 Exchange of information 
 Publishing 
 Membership standards or admissions policies 
 Nature and composition of professional staff 
 Indemnification agreements 
 Antitrust exposures 
 Certification exposures 
 Insurance program sponsorship 
Finances 
Underwriters must carefully assess the financial controls that are in place despite the fact that the 
organization is not strictly in t he business of making a profit . 
Fund-Raising 
Underwriters must also assess th e methods by which funds are se cured from contributors, as well as the 
inducements that are associated with the funds solicitation pro cess. This includes evaluating the extent to 
which funds are used for their i ntended purposes and whether su ch funds personally inure to the benefit of 
directors, officers, and employees of the organization. 
A concern that has become partic ularly relevant is the percenta ge of donated funds that are used for 
administrative purposes rather than to directly further the aim s of the nonprofit. For example, in late 2015 
and early 2016, Wounded Warrior Project (a nonprofit organizati on supporting wounded veterans) was 
criticized for only spending 60 percent of donated funds specif ically on veterans. Giv en situations such as 
this one, underwriters must consid er whether the percentage of a nonprofit organization’s actual 
expenditures on its core mission (as opposed to administrative costs) is in line with other similar 
organizations.  
Advice-Rendering/Pr ofessional Services 
Professional liability suits frequently arise from the advice-g iving activities of nonprofit organizations. 
Examples include pastoral counseling, social services work, leg al aid programs, cre dit counseling, and 
financial advice. However, such  exposures are typically exclude d, either by the directors and officers 
liability policy form or by endorsement, and separate policies (e.g., professional errors and omissions 
(E&O)) are usually needed. 
Exchange of Information 
Trade associations and education-oriented associations are espe cially engaged in disseminating 
information, either in written material or by other means. Libe l, slander, and publis hers liability (e.g., 
copyright violations) can be significant exposures, which may r equire a separate media liability policy. 
Membership Standards/Admissions Policies 
Educational institutions, fraternal organizations, and private clubs face an especially significant risk of 
lawsuits arising from membership s tandards or admissions polici es. Race, sex, religion, national origin, 
and age are examples of factors t hat may allegedly play a role in an individual’s denied membership.   
124 Professional Staff 
The extent to which a nonprofit organization’s staff is managed  by experienced executives is an important 
consideration for an underwriter. A large percentage of part-ti me/volunteer staff, as opposed to those on a 
full-time, compensated basis, ma y make an organization more vul nerable to lawsuits. Experience, time, 
motivation, and resources are more likely to be associated with  full-time, compensated staff. 
Indemnification Agreements 
The extent to which the organiza tion has agreed to indemnify it s directors, officers, and employees (when 
they are sued in conjunction with  their work on behalf of the n onprofit) is another important area that 
underwriters consider.  
Antitrust Exposures 
Antitrust litigation exposure is a n especially important area b ecause many nonprofit organizations 
(including trade associations a nd cooperatives) are composed of  firms that compete against one another. 
Discussions of pricing policies, allocation of territories and customers, and the boycotting of certain 
suppliers are examples of practices that are prohibited by law and may be alleged against nonprofit 
organizations.  
Especially since certain conduct constitutes a per se violation  of the law, irrespective of the motives 
underlying such actions, underwriters must carefully investigat e organizational practices that could be 
construed as violating antitrust statutes. 
Product Certification Exposures 
Some nonprofit organizations certify specific products. For exa mple, an association of chemical 
manufacturers may certify that products produced by its members  are safe and fit for certain uses. As a 
result, associations of this sort could be held liable for impr oper certification in the event of injury or poor 
performance.  
Insurance Program Sponsorship 
Nonprofit organizations are somet imes involved in sponsoring va rious kinds of insurance programs. For 
example, they may encourage par ticipation in purchasing groups or risk retention groups for various lines 
of coverage. Professional associations may also sponsor captive  insurance companies through which their 
members can obtain professional liability insurance. However, i f the insurer or self-insurance program 
becomes insolvent or is unable to pay losses, claims may arise against the sponsoring organization.  
It should be noted, though, that s uch programs are usually cons idered to be an “insurance company E&O 
exposure” and are therefore excluded by most nonprofit director s and officers liability policies.

127 Glossary 
ADA —See Americans with Disabilities Act. 
ADEA —See Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 —A law that prohibits the making of 
employment decisions (e.g., hiring, promotion) based on age. It  applies to employees or applicants who 
are 40 years or older and to companies with 20 or more employee s. The ADEA specifies various remedies 
if a firm is found to have violated the law. Some of these incl ude hiring an applicant who was 
discriminated against; reinstating a terminated employee; and p aying of back wages, liquidated damages, 
"front" pay until an employee r eaches the age of 70, court cost s, and attorneys' fees. 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 —A federal statute passed in 1990, primarily aimed at 
preventing discrimination in hiring persons having a "disabilit y" as defined by the Act. Under the ADA, 
employers must afford job appli cants equal opportunity (i.e., e valuating an applicant solely on his or her 
ability to perform the essential functions of a job, regardless  of disability) and make reasonable 
accommodations to allow disabled employees to perform job funct ions. However, employers are relieved 
from the reasonable accommodation requirement if it creates an "undue hardship," such as excessive costs 
or considerable work disruption . Alleged violations of the ADA are one of the leading perils covered by 
employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. Title  III of the ADA is concerned with making 
public and commercial buildings physically accessible for disab led persons. It imposes remodeling and 
reconstruction requirements on so me organizations that vary dep ending on the prim ary use of each 
building. Some of the requirement s apply regardless of whether the building in question must be 
remodeled or rebuilt for reasons other than ADA compliance. Acc ordingly, the ordinance or law 
exclusions in 1995 and later ed ition Insurance Services Office,  Inc. (ISO), commercial property forms 
contain language intended to mak e it clear that there is no cov erage for the cost of compliance with the 
ADA. 
ARS —See auction rate security. 
auction rate security (ARS) —A type of long-term bond issued by a corporation or a municipa lity. ARSs 
differ from traditional bonds in one crucial respect: rather th an paying a fixed rate of interest for a long 
time (e.g., a minimum of 10, and sometimes as long as 30, years ), the interest rate on an ARS "resets" 
frequently through a process known as a Dutch auction, which ta kes place every 7, 28, or 35 days. At 
each Dutch auction, ARS holders a re given an opportunity to sel l the ARS. Issuers/borrowers of an ARS 
benefit because ARSs can provide them with long-term financing,  but at substantially lower rates, 
compared to traditional long-term bonds. Buyers of ARSs benefit  because, given their short-term nature, 
an ARS offers the liquidity of a money market fund, yet with a higher rate of return. But in February of 
2008, a number of Dutch auctions " failed" due to a lack of buye rs, an event that cau sed ARS investors' 
money to be frozen in their accounts. As a result, many investo rs brought class action lawsuits against the 
banks and brokerages that indu ced them to invest in ARSs. 
Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 —A federal law better known as the McCain-Feingold Act 
regulating the financing of po litical campaigns. Under this law , corporations may not make direct 
contributions (i.e., in the "name" of the corporation) to polit ical candidates or parties in connection with 
federal elections. However, corpor ations may establish "politic al action committees" (PACs), which are 
permitted to raise voluntary contri butions from a "restricted" class of individuals, such as executive and 
managerial employees, stockholde rs, and their families. Directo rs and officers of corporations have  
128 exposure to liability for violating the McCain-Feingold Act, re sulting from the corporation's campaign 
financing activities. 
board committees —Committees formed by members of a corporate board of directors  that are created to 
address a particular aspect or feature of the corporation. Thre e of the most common board committees and 
their responsibilities include (1) audit (overseeing the compan y's financial, accounting, and internal and 
external audit functions), (2) nominating (identifying and recr uiting new/additiona l board members and 
officers), and (3) compensation (recommending appropriate compe nsation levels for the company's 
management, as well as compensati on for members of the board). Board committees normally consist of 
two to four members of a corporate board of directors. 
business judgment rule —A common-law liability doctrine sometimes used to absolve the directors and 
officers of a corporation from liability, provided it can be sh own that a loss resulted from a seemingly 
prudent, good faith business decision that simply turned out to  be incorrect, rather than a grossly 
negligent or fraudulent act. 
CAA —See Clean Air Act of 1970. 
CAFA —See Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. 
case law —See common law. 
CERCLA —See Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li ability Act of 1980. 
Civil Rights Act of 1871 (as amended by the Civil Rights Act of  1991) —A federal act that amends the 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to clarify the pro tections given to older individuals in 
regard to employee benefit plans. 
class action —A type of lawsuit that is broug ht by a single affected individ ual on behalf of a large group 
of similarly affected individuals. Class actions were created b y the judicial system because frequently, the 
number of plaintiffs involved in  a lawsuit is so numerous that it would be onerous to name and adjudicate 
the claims of all plaintiffs  on an individual basis. 
Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) of 2005 —A law intended to prevent abuses associated with class 
action lawsuits. The Act places class action cases under federa l jurisdiction (previously, such cases were 
within the jurisdiction of sta te courts), provided the amount a t issue is greater than $5 million. The Act 
also makes it more difficult for plaintiffs to go "forum shoppi ng" in search of jurisdictions known for 
class action lawsuit abuses. Another important provision within  the Act contains procedures for judicial 
review of attorneys' fees, which  are often excessive relative t o the recoveries received by plaintiffs. 
Opponents of the Act have asserted that these changes will deny  aggrieved persons their day in court by 
making it much more difficult to bring class action suits and t hat taking such cases out of state court 
jurisdiction will clog the federal courts' dockets. 
Clayton Act —A federal act that prohibits price discrimination among purcha sers of goods, exclusive 
dealing arrangements, and corpor ate mergers and acquisitions th at may substantially lessen competition 
or tend to create a monopoly in a line of commerce. 
Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970 —A federal act regulating the emission of harmful pollutants in to the air. It 
requires corporations to list pollutants that may adversely aff ect human health and establishes air quality 
standards. The CAA contains provisions for civil and criminal p enalties and enforcement through citizen 
suits. 
Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972 —A federal act that requires the monitoring of discharges into U.S. 
waters. The CWA contains provisi ons for abatement actions, pena lties, fines, and imprisonment of 
responsible parties.  
129 closely-held public company —A public company in which a high percentage of the firm's stoc k (e.g., 50 
percent or more) is owned by the firm's directors and officers or other so-called insiders, yet is also held 
by members of the public and is traded on one or more of the la rge national stock exchanges. 
common law —Unwritten law derived from cour t case decisions based on custo m and precedent. It is 
contrasted to statutory law. 
Comprehensive Environmental Res ponse, Compensation, and Liabili ty Act (CERCLA) of 1980 —A 
federal act establishing a system for reporting facilities wher e hazardous wastes are or have been disposed 
of, treated, or stored. It also encompasses trust funds finance d by certain taxes to be used for cleanup 
costs. CERCLA also establishes ve ry broad liability standards f or hazardous waste incidents that require 
liable parties to reimburse trust funds that finance cleanup op erations. 
copyright —An exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative ( i.e., similar) works, distribute 
copies of the work, and perform and display the work. Violation  of such rights may result in liability for 
infringement.  
corporate governance —A system specifying the divisi on of duties, rights, and respon sibilities among 
various participants in a corporation, such as the board of dir ectors, the various committees within the 
board of directors, operating ma nagers, and shareholders. Corpo rate governance enumerates the rules, 
guidelines, and procedures for making decisions affecting corpo rate affairs. The term has received 
particular attention in recent years because of massive lawsuit s against the directors and officers of a 
number of high-profile corporati ons that filed for bankruptcy. Many business commentators, as well as 
insurance industry observers, be lieve that a breakdown of corpo rate governance, especially in the area of 
financial and accounting controls, was largely responsible for such failures. 
corporation —An "artificial person," created under the laws of a given stat e. A corporation has an 
identity and an existence distin ct and independent from that of  its individual owners. Corporations have 
the power to (1) act; (2) contract; (3) sue and be sued; and (4 ) own, manage, and buy/sell property. The 
profits (and losses) of the corporation are distributed accordi ng to the ownership interest (i.e., the 
percentage of total shares) held by each shareholder. The defin ing feature of a corporation is its legal 
independence from the people who create it. This means that if a corporation fails, shareholders only 
stand to lose their investment in the company (i.e., the amount  of money they paid for shares of stock in 
the company) but will not be liabl e for any remaining debts owe d to the corporation's creditors. 
Corporations are chartered by all 50 of the United States and b y the federal government in certain 
instances (e.g., national banks  and savings and loan institutio ns). 
credit rating agencies —Privately owned agencies such  as Standard & Poor's, Moody's, a nd Fitch that 
rate securities. 
credit report —An underwriting tool used by insurers. Some individuals or com panies with poor credit 
records may be more likely to hav e insurance claims. For exampl e, a person with financial difficulties 
may not have the funds to repair or replace an aged roof, which  increases the chance of a water damage 
loss. People with major financial  problems may be more inclined  to stage or exaggerate a loss in the effort 
to collect more money from the insurer. Research also indicates  that a person who is less responsible 
about the use of credit is more prone to be less responsible wh ile driving. For commercial lines accounts, 
credit reports such as Dun and Br adstreet are often ordered and  can play an important role in the selection 
process and the pay plan offered. 
CWA —See Clean Water Act of 1972. 
D&B —See Dun and Bradstreet. 
derivative —A financial instrument whose value depends, at least in part, on the value of a related asset 
or liability. In essence, its value  is "derived" from the value s of some underlying asset such as a 
commodity or stocks. For examp le, if an individual or business owns an option to purchase 1,000 shares  
130 of a particular stock at a set pr ice, the value of the option w ill increase as the value of the stock increases. 
Risk managers and financial o fficers often deal in derivatives as a technique for managing their business 
risks. 
derivative lawsuit —A type of lawsuit brought by one o r more stockholders on behal f of the corporation, 
alleging financial loss to the o rganization. The alleged harm m ust be to the corporation as a whole, such 
as the diminishing of the corpor ation's assets, for shareholder s to pursue an action derivatively. Any 
recovery in such suits inures to the benefit of the corporation  itself as opposed to the shareholders who 
institute the action. 
director— A member of a corporation's board of directors who is elected b y the shareholders of a 
corporation to govern and manage  the affairs of the company.  
due care —See due diligence. 
due diligence —Proper care and attention. This term is commonly used to refer  to the review of financial 
and legal documents in a merger or acquisition but is equally a pplicable to virtually any decision-making 
process, including whether to ins ure or self-insure, whether to  form a captive insurance company, and a 
host of other risk management decisions. 
Dun and Bradstreet (D&B)— A company that provides cred it information on businesses and 
corporations. The company’s repor ts are referred to as "D&Bs." 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 —Federal law that established rules and 
regulations to govern employer-pr ovided pensions and other empl oyee benefits provided to U.S. 
employees. 
employment practices liability insurance (EPLI)— A type of liability insurance covering wrongful acts 
arising from the employment process. The most frequent types of  claims covered under such policies 
include wrongful termination, di scrimination, sexual harassment , and retaliation. In a ddition, the policies 
cover claims from a variety of other types of inappropriate wor kplace conduct, including (but not limited 
to) employment-related defamation, invasion of privacy, failure  to promote, deprivation of a career 
opportunity, and negligent evalua tion. The policies cover direc tors and officers, management personnel, 
and employees as insureds. The most common exclusions are for b odily injury (BI), property damage 
(PD), and intentional/dishonest acts. EPLI policies are written  on a claims-made basis. The forms contain 
"shrinking limits" provisions, meaning that insurer payment of defense costs—which are often a 
substantial part of a claim—reduce the policy's limits. This ap proach contrasts with commercial general 
liability (CGL) policies, in whic h defense is covered in additi on to policy limits. Although EPLI is 
available as a stand-alone covera ge, it is also frequently sold  as part of a manage ment liability package 
policy. In addition to providing directors and officers (D&O) a nd fiduciary liability insurance, 
management liability package polic ies afford the option to cove r employment practices liability (EPL). 
EPLI— See employment practices liability insurance . 
Equal Pay Act of 1963 —A federal law prohibiting pay discrimination against employees  because of their 
gender. The Act compels businesses to pay equal wages to employ ees performing substantially equal 
work, regardless of the sex of the individual employees. Pay di fferentials may be based on merit, 
seniority, or any lawful factor other than sex. The Equal Pay A ct applies to all businesses regardless of the 
number of employees. Inequalities in pay between men and women for performance of "substantially 
equal jobs" are prohibited, unl ess the differences are due to a  factor other than sex, such as a seniority 
system or merit system. Claims alleging violation of the Equal Pay Act are covered by employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. 
equity stripping —A type of home equity loan in w hich a disproportionate percent age of minority and 
elderly home owners were saddled  with loans requiring high fees  and high interest rates. Such loans, 
which were common from 2003 to 2008, effectively reduced borrow ers' home equity positions to zero  
131 and were clearly unaffordable, g iven these borrowers' relativel y limited incomes. In response to the 
widespread use of such loans, a number of consumer organization s, in conjunction with various state 
attorneys general, brought lawsu its against the major banks and  their directors and officers who had 
perpetrated equity stripping. The  suits were based on the theor y that banks, along with their directors and 
officers, encouraged and assisted  lenders in what amounted to p redatory lending schemes, knowing they 
could package and sell these loan s in the form of mortgage-back ed bonds and, at the same time, remove 
such loans from their own financ ial statements. A number of the se suits have been settled, with payments 
made to affected home owne rs. Other suits are ongoing. ERISA —See Employment Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974. 
False Claims Act— A federal act amended in 1986 to  permit private citizens to bri ng what are known as 
qui tam suits on behalf of the U.S. government against anyone d efrauding the U.S. government. 
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 —A law allowing employees to take up to 12 weeks annually of 
job-protected unpaid leave. Such leaves are permitted in the ev ent of a serious illness of the employee or 
family member, or the birth or placement (through adoption or f oster care) of a child. The law applies to 
employers having 50 or more empl oyees and to employees who have  worked for the employer for a 
minimum of 1,250 hours during the prior year. Charges of discri mination against those taking leave under 
the Act (or by those prevented from taking leave under the Act)  can be filed with the Department of 
Labor, which investigates and enforces claims. In addition, an employee can sue his or her employer 
individually. Such claims are c overed by employment practices l iability (EPL) policies. 
FCPA —See Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. 
Federal Trade Commission Act— A federal act that established th e Federal Trade Commission (FT C). 
This commission was authorized  to issue “cease and desist” orde rs to large corporations to curb unfair 
trade practices. Unfair methods of competition include deceptiv e advertisements and pricing. 
fiduciary —As defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERI SA), an individual or 
corporation that (1) exercises any discretionary authority or d iscretionary control in managing a pension 
or benefit plan, or exercises any authority or control in manag ing or disposing of its  assets; (2) renders 
investment advice for a fee or o ther compensation, with respect  to any monies or other property belonging 
to the plan; or (3) has any discretionary authority or responsi bility in administering the plan. ERISA, 
which was passed in 1974, not only formalized the law associate d with the administration of employee 
pension and benefit plans, but it also broadened the scope of s uch liability so that it became a "personal" 
rather than simply a "corporate" liability. The effect of this change was that soon after ERISA's 
enactment, insurance companies be gan offering fiduciary liabili ty insurance policies, which were 
specifically designed to cover this newly legislated exposure. 
Financial restatement— A material adjustment to a corporate financial statement that a ffects the 
cumulative results of operations during past years. Most often,  a financial restatement takes the form of a 
revision to a corporation's past  operating results when they ar e significantly less favorable than was 
originally noted. In recent year s, a number of major public cor porations have issued restatements, which 
have, in turn, prompted major se ll-offs of the organizations' s hares of stock. This ultimately has resulted 
in claims against the firms' directors and officers, alleging f raud and mismanagement. Such claims are 
covered by directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance pol icies.  
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 —A law imposing criminal liability on corporate 
directors and officers for illegal payments made to foreign off icials. For example, the minister of trade in 
Country A may demand an annual $50,000 payment from Corporation  X in return for allowing the 
corporation to ship its products  into Country A. Corporation X' s payment of such monies would constitute 
a violation of the FCPA and could subject Corporation X and its  directors and officers to liability in the 
United States. FCPA prosecutions h ave increased markedly in rec ent years. This, in part, resulted because 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that senior executives scrutini ze their company's internal controls;  
132 certify its financial statements; and report possible FCPA viol ations to the company's board of directors, 
its audit committee, or its chief legal officer. One high-profi le FCPA case in 2012 involved a former Wal-
Mart executive who alleged that  his firm paid millions of dolla rs to Mexican government officials in 
return for expediting the opening of new stores there. 
friendly takeover— A situation in which a target company's management and board of  directors agree to 
a merger or acquisition by another company. 
groupthink— A type of thought exhibited by g roup members who attempt to mit igate conflict and reach 
consensus without critically tes ting, analyzing, or evaluating ideas. 
hostile takeover— A merger or acquisition situatio n where the company being acqui red does not approve 
of the buyout and fights against the acquisition.  
initial public offering (IPO) —The process of selling stock in a corporation for the first ti me to the 
general public. IPOs are handled by investment banking firms, w hich study the corporation's financial 
situation and then decide how m any shares of stock should be so ld and at what price. Individual investors 
are sometimes shut out of IPOs because investment bankers typic ally dole out IPO shares to institutional 
customers, such as mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and insu rance companies. Accordingly, IPOs 
have received particular attention in recent years because clas s action lawsuits against corporate directors 
and officers have arisen in conjunction with the way in which t he IPOs were allocated among various 
parties. Such claims are known as IPO laddering claims. 
inside directors —Members of a corporate board of directors who are also employe es of the corporation. 
Usually, a corporation's chief executive officer (CEO), chief o perating officer (COO), and chief financial 
officer (CFO) are members of th e corporation's board and are th erefore considered inside directors 
because they are also employees. In contrast to inside director s are persons known as "outside directors," 
who are not employed by the corporation.  
insider trading —The trading of a corporation's stock (or other securities, suc h as bonds) by corporate 
insiders. Corporate insiders inc lude officers, directors, or pe rsons holding substantial (e.g., more than 5 
percent) blocks of the firm's st ock. Insider trading is legal, provided the person making the trade did not 
do so on the basis of private information to which the public w as not privy and reported the trade to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Conversely, trades by  insiders are illegal when they are 
made with nonpublic knowledge. Dir ectors and officers (D&O) lia bility insurance policies specifically 
exclude coverage for claims i nvolving damages produced by illeg al insider trading. However, the policies 
do cover the cost of defending ag ainst allegations of illegal i nsider trading. 
interlock— A situation that occurs when two or more board members also sit  together on another 
corporate board.  
Internal Revenue Code— Federal code that, among other th ings, requires employers to wi thhold federal 
income and social security tax es from their employees' wages. T he Code imposes personal liability on 
"responsible persons" if the business does not collect or pay o ver these taxes to the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
Investment Company Act of 1940— A law requiring that mutual funds register with the federal 
government. The Act's original intent was to protect the public  from many of the abuses engaged in by 
mutual funds during the 1920s, many of which were responsible f or the Wall Street Crash of 1929. On a 
more contemporary basis, the Act has assumed particular importa nce because it affords individuals who 
serve as fiduciaries of employee benefits plans a layer of insu lation from liability. Specifically, if it can be 
shown that a fiduciary selected an investment adviser who is re gistered under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, the fiduciary cannot be held liable for the invest ment adviser's imprudent investment 
decisions. Rather, liability can only attach when it can be sho wn that the fiduciary failed to select an 
adviser who is registered under the Act.  
133 IPO—See initial public offering. 
Lanham Act— A federal act protecting trademarks from unauthorized use. 
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 —A federal law amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and statin g 
that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal pay  lawsuit begins to  run with each new 
discriminatory paycheck. The law is intended to overturn the U. S. Supreme Court's ruling in Ledbetter v. 
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , 550 U.S. 618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 982 (2007), in whic h the court 
held that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal pa y lawsuit begins to run on the date on which 
the initial discriminatory pay level was agreed, not on the dat e of the most recent paycheck, as a lower 
court had ruled. The Act was inte nded to clarify the intent of Title VII as it pertains to discriminatory pay 
decisions. Accordingly, the new s tatute enables female workers to litigate allegedly discriminatory pay 
decisions that were made many y ears in the past, irrespective o f the requirement that a claim be filed 
within 180 days of a discriminatory act. 
McCain-Feingold Act —See Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. 
minutes— Documents that record the eve nts taking place at a meeting. 
nonsalary items— Compensation such as bonuses, stock options, and similar incent ives. 
Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act)— A federal act that imposes on employers a general 
duty to provide a working environment that is free from hazards  likely to cause serious harm or death to 
employees and requires employers to comply with specific occupa tional safety and health standards 
promulgated under the Act. 
Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990— A federal act amending the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act of 1967 to clarify the protections given to olde r individuals in regard to employee 
benefit plans. 
option backdating —Occurs when a stock option exer cise date is set prior to the d ate on which the option 
was granted and at a lower exerc ise price than the current mark et price of the company's stock. For 
example, assume that on January 1 , 2006, a company's stock is s elling for $25 per share. Also assume that 
the company's chief executive o fficer (CEO) is given a 4-year o ption grant covering the period from 
January 1, 2004, to January 1, 200 8, and that on January 1, 200 4, the stock was selling for $15 per share. 
"Backdating" the option grant by  2 years in this instance allow s the CEO to purchase the stock at $15, 
rather than at the current $25 p er share price, thereby locking  in an automatic profit. Option backdating is 
legal, provided the backdating is  clearly communicated to stock holders and as long as the effect of the 
backdating is properly reflected in both earnings reports and t ax payments. However, there have been a 
number of lawsuits against corporate directors and officers all eging illegal option backdating in which 
these conditions were not met. 
opt-out lawsuits —A type of lawsuit in which an individual plaintiff "opts out" of the larger securities 
class action lawsuit that is also being brought against the sam e corporate defendant. Opt-out suits are 
most often filed by an institutional investor (e.g., a bank, in surer, or pension fund). By making a claim 
that is separate from the larger  class action, an individual pl aintiff can sometimes negotiate both a larger 
and more rapid settlement recove ry than if the plaintiff was a more passive beneficiary of the class action 
lawsuit. In addition, by settli ng on an accelerated basis, an o pt-out plaintiff gets "first dibs" at the 
defendant's directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance po licy proceeds. This is important because 
the defense expenditures require d by complex, protracted securi ties litigation rapidly depletes and 
frequently exhausts D&O policy limits, often before monies are available to make actual claim 
settlements.  
OSH Act— See Occupational Safety and Health Act. 
outside directors —Members of a corporate board of directors who are not employee s of the corporation 
or otherwise affiliated with it. Outside directors usually have  special qualifications and expertise that  
134 make them valuable in managing the company—hence their appointm ent to the company's board. In 
contrast to outside directors are inside directors, who are als o employees of the corporation.  
patent infringement —An encroachment on a right granted by a government to an inven tor assuring the 
sole right to make, use, and sell an invention for a certain ti me period. Coverage for this exposure is 
normally not provided by liability policies. 
PDA —See Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. 
Ponzi scheme— A scheme that operates by obtaining money from new investors th at is then used to pay 
off existing investors when they seek to withdraw monies from t he investment. Ponzi schemes eventually 
collapse when cash inflows from new investors cease or when wit hdrawal requests become so large that 
the available funds cannot meet them. 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978 —An amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964. The PDA brought "pregnancy, c hildbirth, or related medica l conditions" within the purview of 
"sex" as a characteristic protect ed by Title VII. This legislat ion created a new "protected class"—pregnant 
women—and gave them the right to bring claims for discriminatio n. The PDA allows a pregnant woman 
to recover equitable relief (e.g ., job reinstatement following termination), compensatory relief, and, at 
times, punitive damages to remedy acts of discrimination on the  part of her employer. Coverage for such 
claims is available under employment practices liability insura nce (EPLI) policies. 
private equity firm —A company that raises money in p rivate markets (i.e., from ins titutional investors 
such as pension funds or from w ealthy individuals) rather than from public markets (such as major stock 
exchanges) and then uses these moni es to make various types of investments. The most well-known 
private equity firms, such as K ohlberg Kravis Roberts and Black stone, operate by buying all of the shares 
of a company listed on a public s tock exchange (such as the New  York Stock Exchange ). Since it now 
owns the corporation, the priva te equity firm then brings in a new management team in an attempt to 
make the newly purchased company more profitable and, thus, mor e valuable. Ultimately, the private 
equity group resells the company  later, hopefully for a higher price per share than the one for which it was 
originally acquired on the public market. 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995 —A law aimed at reducing the number of 
claims against corporate directors and officers that allege sec urities violations. 
privately held corporation —A type of corporation whose shares are not for sale to the pub lic. Rather, 
the shares of privately held comp anies are usually owned by a s mall group of persons—often, although 
not always, family members and/or senior executives and manager s of the company. Unlike publicly held 
corporations, the shares of stock in privately held corporation s are not listed on the major stock 
exchanges. 
proxy statement— A statement required when a corporation solicits the votes of i ts shareholders on a 
particular issue. The statement g enerally includes (1) voting p rocedures and information on the issue 
being decided, (2) background information about the company's n ominated directors, (3) details of 
director/executive compensation, and (4) a breakdown of audit a nd nonaudit fees paid to the auditor. 
PSLRA —See Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
publicly held corporation —A corporation whose shares of s tock are held by and are availa ble for 
purchase by members of the public . The shares of public corpora tions can be bought or sold on one of the 
major stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYS E) or the National Association of 
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ).  
public offering— The public sale of a company's shares of stock. 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act of 19 70—A law providing for treble 
damages against those engaged in "a pattern of racketeering act ivity." At one time, a number of liability  
135 policies excluded coverage for s uits alleging RICO Act violatio ns against insureds. Now, however, this 
exclusion is much less common. 
RCRA —See Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. 
repurchase— A company's purchase of stock in its own company. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 —A federal act regulating the handling of 
hazardous waste from its generati on to disposal. The Act define s "hazardous waste" and establishes 
standards and permit programs fo r waste generating, treatment, storage, and disposal. It implements 
detailed recordkeeping requirements and imposes civil and crimi nal penalties for noncompliance. 
RICO —See Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
Robinson-Patman Act of 1936— A federal act that imposes both civil and criminal penalties fo r 
predatory price-cutting and othe r actions taken to eliminate co mpetition. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 —A sweeping corporate financial reform bill passed by Congress and 
signed into law by President Bush in July 2002. The Act is a re sponse to a number of accounting scandals 
involving several high-profile public corporations, including E nron and WorldCom. The reforms 
promulgated by the Act are an a ttempt to prevent similar abuses  in the future and to restore investor 
confidence that suffered signifi cantly as a result of these sca ndals. The key provisions include 
requirements that chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief fin ancial officers (CFOs) certify their 10-Q 
and 10-K reports and that all audit committee members be indepe ndent. In addition, the law bans personal 
loans to executive officers and di rectors, prohibits insider tr ades during 401(k) blackout periods, requires 
accelerated reporting of stock tra des by insiders, and mandates  more detailed disclosure of off-balance-
sheet transactions. Finally, the law requires that CEOs and CFO s return any profits they obtained as a 
result of material misstatements  in financial documents and req uires attorneys working with offending 
corporations to report violations of the Act. 
SEC —See Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Securities Act of 1933 —An act to ensure the availabilit y of complete and reliable inf ormation about 
securities being sold to the public. The most important compone nts of the Act are Section 5, which makes 
it illegal to offer or sell secur ities to the public unless the y have first been registered with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Section 11, which imposes ci vil liability for material 
misstatements in registration statements. Failure to comply wit h the Act's technical or substantive 
requirements in connection with a public offering of a security  can result in liability of the corporation 
and its directors and officers. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)— The U.S. government agenc y primarily responsibility 
for enforcing federal securities laws and regulating the securi ties industry, the nation's stock and options 
exchanges, and other activities a nd organizations, including U. S. electronic securities markets. 
securities class action claims —Claims brought by a publicly hel d corporation's shareholders a lleging 
that actions by the firm's directors and officers caused a loss  in market value of the firm's shares. 
Coverage for such claims is ava ilable under directors and offic ers (D&O) liability insurance policies.  
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 —The Act and its accompanying ru les were enacted to protect inv estors 
in connection with the trading of  securities already issued and  outstanding. The most important 
components of the Act are Section 10(b) and Securities and Exch ange Commission (SEC) Rule 10(b)–5, 
which prohibits manipulative or deceptive acts in connection wi th the purchase or sale of a security. 
Corporate directors and officers are frequently the targets of lawsuits brought under these antifraud 
provisions. 
securitization —A process whereby periodic cash flows from a given source are pooled, packaged, and 
sold to investors, usually in the form of bonds. Between 2003 a nd 2006, large numbers of subprime  
136 mortgage loans were pooled in th is manner and then sold to inve stors who, in return for paying an up-
front principal amount, received periodic payments (usually qua rterly) in the same manner as 
bondholders. By 2006, approximate ly 63 percent of all subprime loans were being sold and packaged in 
this fashion. When a wave of subpr ime mortgage loan defaults be gan in 2007, the value of the bonds 
began to plummet because the cash  flows that "securitized" the bonds (i.e., the periodic monthly 
payments from the subprime loans)  were substantially lower than  anticipated, given massive numbers of 
loan defaults, and were therefore insufficient to pay the inter est required by the bonds. This, in turn, 
triggered huge losses for the i nvestors who bought these bonds.  As a result, the investors brought literally 
hundreds of class action lawsuits a gainst the directors and off icers of both the banks that made the 
subprime loans and the investment  bankers who packaged the loan s into bonds. 
Sherman Act— A federal act that prohibits cont racts, combinations (i.e., gro ups of companies, also 
sometimes referred to as cartels), and conspiracies in restrain t of trade, monopolies, and attempts and 
conspiracies to monopolize. 
spring loading— A controversial and usually ille gal form of backdating. There a re two types: (1) granting 
an option just prior to favorable news, and (2) granting an opt ion just after negative news. 
stock drop litigation —Litigation brought against corporate directors and officers an d trustees of 
corporate 401(k) plans. Such litig ation, normally filed in the form of a class action lawsuit, arises when 
the market price of a company's stock drops sharply, and as a c onsequence, employee 401(k) plan holders 
lose substantial sums of money because they hold large amounts of company stock in their individual 
accounts. In these lawsuits, emplo yee-plaintiffs allege that th e directors and officers were fiduciaries of 
the 401(k) plans and that the conduct governing the administrat ion of such plans is therefore governed by 
the provisions found within the Employee Retirement Income Secu rity Act (ERISA). Among the most 
common allegations of negligence asserted in these claims inclu de (1) intentional disclosure of false and 
misleading information about the  company's finances, which indu ced the employees to buy shares of the 
company's stock; (2) failure to disclose material information a bout the company and its financial 
condition and performance in state ments to the general public, to shareholders, or to employees; (3) 
failure to disclose such information to other plan fiduciaries (such as investment advisers and brokers) 
who had responsibility for investing plan assets; and (4) failu re to correct misleading statements made by 
other officers and plan fiduciaries and to adequately monitor w rongdoing by other plan fiduciaries. 
stock option —The right to purchase shares of s tock in a corporation at a sp ecified price usually, but not 
always, on or before a specified date. Stock options are routin ely offered to corporate officers and 
directors (and sometimes to employees) as a means of providing them with added incentive to improve 
the firm's profitability, which, in theory at least, will boost  the market price of the corporation's stock. In 
recent years, the granting of s tock options has been the subjec t of litigation against a number of 
corporations and their directors and officers by plaintiffs who  have alleged that these organizations 
engaged in the practice of ille gally "backdating" option grants . 
stock option claims —Allegations by current or former employees that they have been  wrongfully 
deprived of monies due from stoc k option grants provided by the  organization. The largest stock option 
claims involve those by high-level executives who, following te rmination or forced resignation, assert 
that they have been wrongfully deprived of the financial gain p roduced by stock option grants. Such 
claims are covered by employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) policy forms. 
subprime loans —Loans on residential real estate carrying interest rates that are substantially above the 
prime mortgage loan rate. Subprim e loans are made to borrowers who pose a high credit risk because they 
have either (1) a low credit score or (2) a high debt-to-income  ratio. Often, subprime loans carry relatively 
low interest rates during the first 2–3 years of the agreement but then increase sharply thereafter, which, 
in some cases, causes the monthly payment to double or even tri ple. Beginning in 2006, falling national 
real estate prices combined with  "resets" to higher monthly pay ment amounts triggered numerous 
subprime mortgage loan defaults  by borrowers. This, in turn, ca used huge earnings losses for the banks  
137 that made subprime loans. Ultima tely, the directors and officer s of these banks were hit with literally 
hundreds of class action lawsuits b y investors, who alleged tha t the directors and officers had been 
negligent in making such loans. 
tag along claims —A type of claim in which plaintiffs assert that, in addition t o pension plan fiduciaries, 
corporate directors and officers are also liable for pension pl an defaults and payment shortfalls and, 
therefore, must also "tag along" as named defendants in such la wsuits. The rationale for naming directors 
and officers as defendants in fiduciary claims is that they sho uld also bear responsibility for losses 
sustained by pension and 401(k)  plans because they are responsi ble for selecting fiduciaries and 
monitoring their decisions. 
teaser rates— Initially low mortgage rates that later reset to a much higher rate, which, of course, produce 
a significantly higher monthly payment. 
tie-in endorsement —An endorsement sometimes added to a directors and officers (D& O) liability 
insurance policy form. Tie-in e ndorsements state that if an ins ured's D&O and fiduciary liability policies 
are written by the same insurer, only one policy limit applies (or the higher of the two limits applies if the 
limits are different) when a claim arises from essentially the same set of acts or facts. Tie-in endorsements 
first appeared after Enron's 401( k) plan holders filed lawsuits , alleging almost the identical wrongful acts 
that were stated in shareholde r class action suits against Enro n and its directors and officers. 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964— See Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
trademark— A trademark or service mark includes any word, name, symbol, de vice, or any combination 
used or intended to be used to identify and distinguish the goo ds/services of one seller or provider from 
those of others, and to indicate the source of the goods/servic es.  
treble damages— Triple the amount of the actual/compensatory damages to be awar ded to a prevailing 
plaintiff.  
ultra vires  acts —Acts that are beyond the powers conferred upon a corporation b y its charter or by the 
laws of its state of incorporation. Corporate directors are not  only liable for their own ultra vires  acts, but 
can also be held liable for ultra vires  acts authorized by the board as a whole. For example, if a 
corporation's charter bans loans  to directors and officers, the  granting of such a loan by the board would 
constitute an ultra vires  act for which all board members  could be held legally liable. Coverage for ultra 
vires  acts are excluded by directors and officers (D&O) liability po licies if they are considered to have 
been dishonest, fraudulent, or malicious or if such acts violat e criminal statutes.
