ivIntroduction
For
most
companies,
the
costs
of
on-the-job
injuries
and
illnesses
are
the
most
significant
component
of 
total
cost
of
risk.
Much
of
the
cost
is
driven
by
state
workers
compensation
laws.
However,
many
energy 
companies
have—or
may
incur—operations
on
or
near
bodies
of
water,
and
their
obligations
to
provide 
compensation
for
injured
workers
may
stem
from
federal
laws
such
as
the
Longshore
and
Harbor 
Workers’
Compensation
Act,
the
Jones
Act,
or
general
maritime
law,
in
addition
to
traditional
workers 
compensation
laws. 
The
interaction
of
workers
compensation
insurance
with
state
and
federal
workers
compensation
laws
is 
unique
in
the
insurance
industry,
and
changes
in
these
Acts
or
the
regulations
implementing
them
have 
profound
effects
on
the
insurance
line.
Additionally,
lawsuits
related
to
employee
injuries—whether 
covered
by
workers
compensation
or
not—continue
to
grow.
Lastly,
since
this
is
the
most
costly
property 
and
casualty
insurance
coverage
for
most
energy
industry
companies,
as
well
as
most
other
types
of 
businesses,
the
insurance
products
and
methods
of
handling
this
risk
have
evolved
and
grown 
accordingly. 
This
course—Workers
Compensation
and
Maritime
Liability
for
the
Energy
Industry—is
designed
to 
provide
detailed
information
on
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance
for
energy 
companies.
It
begins
with
an
introduction
to
workers
compensation
(WC),
explaining
how
the
law
has 
evolved
from
the
first
state
act
in
1902
to
its
current
status
today.
Today’s
state
WC
laws
are
examined, 
including
who
is
covered
and
under
what
circumstances. 
Next
is
the
workers
compensation
policy
itself.
The
various
parts
of
the
policy
are
explained
in
detail,
as 
are
the
endorsements
commonly
used
to
modify
the
workers
compensation
policy.
This
is
followed
by
a 
brief
overview
of
the
workers
compensation
marketplace—the
various
ways
workers
compensation 
insurance
is
purchased
in
the
states
and
alternatives
to
insurance. 
The
course
then
moves
to
the
federal
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
laws,
explaining
the 
history
of
the
law,
who
is
covered,
key
applicability
issues,
covered
injuries
and
diseases,
benefits,
how 
claims
are
handled,
and
how
to
insure
the
exposures. 
Course

Introduction
to
Workers
Compensation
Chapter
Overview
and
Objectives
Workers
compensation
insurance
is
unique
in
that
it
is
closely
tied
to
the
laws
of
the
various
states.
In 
order
to
understand
how
the
workers
compensation
system
works,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
general 
understanding
of
workers
compensation
law.
This
chapter
reviews
the
evolution
of
workers
compensation 
law
and,
in
general
terms,
the
operation
of
the
law
in
the
context
of
the
energy
industry. 
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
recognize
the
factors
that
led
to
the
evolution
of
the
current
state
workers
compensation
system,
2.
distinguish
between
common
law
and
statutory
obligations
to
compensate
injured
workers,
and
3.
recognize
how
state
workers
compensation
statutes
and
regulations
apply
to
the
energy
industry.
While
workers
compensation
benefits
are
prescribed
by
state
law,
several
federal
statutes,
as
well
as 
maritime
law,
also
operate
to
provide
benefits
to
injured
workers
in
many
circumstances
common
to
the 
energy
industry.
These
are
discussed
in
Chapters
5
and
6. 
The
Evolution
of
Workers
Compensation
Law
Before
the
Industrial
Revolution,
there
was
little
reason
for
the
development
of
workers
compensation 
statutes.
Sailors
were
entitled
to
wages,
transportation,
maintenance,
and
cure
if
they
fell
sick
or
were 
injured
in
the
service
of
a
ship,
and
they
could
also
bring
an
action
against
the
ship
itself
under
general 
maritime
law
if
their
illness
was
caused
by
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel.
Injuries
to
trade
workers 
were
infrequent
since
virtually
all
of
their
work
was
performed
slowly
and
meticulously
by
hand. 
The
advent
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
brought
high-speed
machinery
and
mass-production
techniques, 
combined
with
very
poor
working
conditions.
This
led
to
a
startling
increase
in
work-related
injury, 
disease,
and
death.
An
injured
employee’s
only
recourse
was
to
sue
the
employer
based
on
the
employer’s 
failure
to
meet
one
or
more
of
its
common
law
obligations
to
the
employee: 
1.
To
provide
a
safe
place
to
work
2.
To
provide
an
employee
with
a
sufficient
number
of
competent
fellow
employees
3.
To
provide
safe
tools
and
equipment
4.
To
develop
and
enforce
safety
rules
5.
To
warn
employees
of
inherent
work-related
dangers
of
which
employees
could
not
reasonably
be 
expected
to
be
aware
In
time,
a
series
of
common
law
defenses
against
such
negligent
actions
developed
to
the
point
where
it 
was
virtually
impossible
for
an
injured
employee
to
win
the
suit: 
•
The
assumption
of
risk
defense
stated
that
an
employee
who
voluntarily
entered
into
a
job
knowing 
of
the
unsafe
nature
of
the
premises
or
the
work
and
who
understood
the
risks
inherent
in
the
job 
could
not
recover
for
a
resulting
injury.
For
example,
a
bricklayer
might
have
been
denied
recovery 
for
a
strained
back
on
the
grounds
that
he
or
she
assumed
the
risk
of
injury
since
he
or
she
knew 
(or
at
least
should
have
known)
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
this
type
of
injury
due
to
the
heavy
2lifting
required
on
the
job.
•
The
contributory
negligence
defense
stated
that
if
the
employee’s
negligence
somehow
contributed 
to
his
or
her
own
injury,
then
the
employee
was
not
entitled
to
recover
damages
for
his
or
her 
injury.
Therefore,
even
if
the
employer’s
negligence
was
the
major
cause
of
the
injury,
any 
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employee,
however
slight,
prevented
the
employee
from
collecting 
for
his
or
her
injuries.
•
The
negligence
of
a
fellow
employee
defense
stated
that
an
employer
was
not
liable
for
an
injury
to 
an
employee
that
resulted
solely
from
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
employee.
This
defense
rule
was 
an
exception
to
the
basic
common
law
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
under
which
an
employer 
was
held
liable
for
the
negligent
acts
of
its
agents
or
employees.
As
if
these
common
law
defenses
were
not
enough,
the
common
law
in
the
1800s
stated
that
only
the 
injured
worker
had
a
right
to
file
a
suit
against
the
employer.
If
a
worker
died
from
his
or
her
on-the-job 
injuries,
those
dependent
on
that
worker,
such
as
his
or
her
family,
did
not
have
the
right
to
bring
a
suit 
for
damages
against
the
employer. 
Employers
Liability
Statutes
and
Judicial
Modifications
By
the
late
1800s,
it
became
apparent
that
the
system
simply
was
not
working.
Occupational
injuries
and 
deaths
were
increasing,
and
many
workers
and
their
families
were
being
left
destitute
or
impoverished 
because
of
their
inability
to
collect
for
the
negligence
of
the
employer.
Public
pressure
eventually
brought 
about
changes
in
the
common
law
through
both
statutory
and
judicial
modification. 
In
many
states,
the
concept
of
contributory
negligence
was
replaced
by
the
concept
of
comparative 
negligence,
either
through
legislative
enactment
or
through
court
rulings.
Under
this
doctrine,
the 
negligence
of
an
injured
employee
did
not
constitute
an
absolute
defense
for
the
employer,
but
the 
percentage
of
the
employee’s
negligence
was
used
to
reduce
the
amount
of
recovery.
For
example,
an 
employee
who
suffered
$1,000
in
damages
but
was
held
to
be
20
percent
negligent
for
the
injury
would 
receive
$800. 
In
many
jurisdictions,
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
employee
defense
was
also
modified
through
the 
adoption
of
the
vice
principal
rule
and/or
the
superior-servant
rule
by
the
courts.
The
vice
principal
rule 
basically
stated
that
the
employer’s
common
law
obligations
(to
provide
a
safe
workplace,
safe
tools,
etc.) 
were
nondelegable
duties.
Therefore,
the
employer
was
responsible
for
injuries
to
an
employee
caused
by 
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
employee
if
the
fellow
employee
had
been
given
the
responsibility
of
seeing 
that
these
obligations
were
met.
In
other
words,
the
employer
could
not
evade
its
common
law
obligations 
by
delegating
authority
to
an
employee.
Similarly,
the
superior-servant
rule
stated
that
the
employer
was 
responsible
for
injuries
to
workers
caused
by
the
negligence
of
another
employee
when
such
an
employee 
had
supervisory
or
directive
authority
over
the
injured
employee.
If
a
supervisor
was
negligent
in
regard 
to
the
work-related
injury
of
one
of
his
or
her
subordinates,
the
employer
was
responsible
for
the
injury. 
Finally,
around
the
turn
of
the
century,
many
states
began
to
enact
legislation
that
allowed
the
dependents 
of
a
deceased
employee
to
bring
suits
for
damages
against
the
employer
claiming
the
employer
was 
negligent
in
the
employee’s
death.
This
recovery
was
limited
to
the
actual
monetary
loss
the
dependent 
suffered
due
to
the
employee’s
death.
No
recovery
was
allowed
for
conditions
such
as
mental
anguish. 
Early
Workers
Compensation
Laws
Although
the
various
employers
liability
statutes
and
judicial
modifications
of
common
law
were
an 
improvement,
many
legislators
were
still
unhappy
with
the
common
law
system
of
compensating
injured 
employees.
An
employee
still
had
to
resort
to
the
courts
in
order
to
be
compensated
for
an
injury.
Many 
employees
did
not
have
the
necessary
resources
to
pursue
this
long
and
expensive
process.
While
many 
lawyers
would
take
such
cases
on
a
contingency
basis,
their
legal
fees
often
amounted
to
one-half
of
any 
judgment.
In
addition,
this
system
was
of
no
help
to
the
injured
worker
who
could
not
prove
employer 
negligence. 
While
judicial
and
legislative
bodies
in
the
United
States
were
busy
trying
to
improve
the
common
law
3system
of
compensating
injured
employees
through
the
enactment
of
employers
liability
statutes
and 
judicial
modification,
European
countries
were
experimenting
with
the
first
workers
compensation 
systems.
What
made
workers
compensation
law
dramatically
different
from
the
common
law
system
was 
that
it
was
a
“no-fault”
law.
When
an
employee’s
job
and
injury
were
covered
by
the
workers 
compensation
law,
the
employee
was
compensated
by
the
employer
regardless
of
whether
the
employer 
was
negligent.
In
exchange
for
this
automatic
“no-fault”
compensation,
the
employee
forfeited
the
right
to 
bring
suit
for
compensatory
damages
against
the
employer. 
The
common
law
system
of
compensating
injured
employees
has
not
been
totally
eliminated
by
the 
passage
of
workers
compensation
laws.
The
common
law
system
still
applies
to
certain
employments
that 
are
not
covered
under
workers
compensation
law.
These
employments
are
discussed
later
in
this
chapter. 
Today’s
State
Workers
Compensation
Laws
All
50
states
and
the
District
of
Columbia
now
have
workers
compensation
laws,
but
the
specific 
provisions
of
workers
compensation
laws
vary
considerably
from
state
to
state. 
Often,
employers
simply
buy
a
workers
compensation
policy
and
rely
on
it
to
provide
all
the
protection 
they
need
against
employment-related
injuries.
However,
the
differences
in
state
laws
and
benefits
can 
expose
businesses
to
liabilities
far
greater
than
expected,
and
properly
insuring
these
risks
may
require 
modifying
the
policy
with
one
or
more
standard
or
manuscript
endorsements. 
This
section
summarizes
key
state
workers
compensation
laws.

Workers
compensation
benefits
Most
of
the
topics
reviewed
in
this
section
can
be
found
in
the
state
workers
compensation
statutes.
Due 
to
the
general
nature
of
the
discussion,
readers
should
consult
the
workers
compensation
statutes
of
a
state 
for
the
specifics
of
that
state’s
workers
compensation
law.
Qualified
legal
counsel
should
be
consulted
for 
legal
interpretation
of
the
statutes. 
Compulsory
versus
Elective
Workers
Compensation
Laws
Today,
the
vast
majority
of
state
workers
compensation
laws
are
compulsory,
meaning
that
an
employer 
must
accept
the
law
and
pay
workers
compensation
benefits,
as
specified
by
that
state,
to
an
injured 
employee
who
is
covered
under
the
law. 
4Two
states—Texas
and
New
Jersey—currently
have
elective
workers
compensation
laws,
meaning
that 
an
employer
has
the
choice
of
either
accepting
or
rejecting
the
workers
compensation
law.
However,
in 
New
Jersey,
employers
are
required
to
purchase
either
workers
compensation
coverage
or
employers 
liability
coverage.
If
an
employer
in
one
of
these
states
decides
to
reject
the
law
and
an
injured
employee 
brings
a
negligence
suit
against
the
employer,
the
employer
will
be
denied
the
use
of
the
three
common 
law
defenses
of
assumption
of
risk,
contributory
negligence,
and
negligence
of
a
fellow
employee.
In 
practice,
because
of
the
threat
of
facing
a
large
liability
suit
without
these
three
defenses,
few
employers 
in
these
states
reject
the
workers
compensation
law. 
Exclusive
Remedy
Every
state’s
workers
compensation
law
contains
an
exclusive
remedy
provision
that
stipulates
that
the 
benefits
prescribed
in
the
act
are
the
sole
remedy
against
the
employer
for
covered
injuries
sustained
on 
the
job.
(Most
states
allow
suits
against
the
employer
if
the
employer
has
failed
to
either
purchase
workers 
compensation
insurance
or
obtain
authorization
to
self-insure
as
required
by
the
law.
See
the
discussion
of 
penalties
below.) 
Many
states
also
allow
suits
against
the
employer
when
the
employer
intentionally
caused
the
injury. 
Under
these
circumstances,
most
states
deprive
employers
of
the
normal
common
law
defenses 
(assumption
of
risk,
fellow
servant
liability,
and
contributory
negligence)
against
such
allegations.
The 
majority
of
states
also
shield
fellow
employees
of
compliant
employers
from
tort
liability
when
their 
negligence
results
in
an
injury
to
another
employee.
A
few
specifically
allow
suits
against
a
fellow 
employee
when
that
employee
intentionally
caused
the
injury. 
Penalties
for
Failure
To
Secure
Benefits
To
compel
compliance
with
the
workers
compensation
insurance
requirements,
all
states
impose 
significant
penalties
for
failure
to
secure
benefits
as
required.
Usually,
penalties
are
in
the
form
of
fines, 
but
quite
a
few
states
allow
for
the
possibility
of
criminal
penalties
as
well.
Executive
officers
of
a 
corporation
may
be
personally
liable
for
these
penalties.
In
many
states,
employers
can
be
enjoined
from 
conducting
business
until
compliance
is
achieved.
Some
state
laws
allow
injured
employees
of
defaulting 
employers
to
be
awarded
increased
benefits,
ranging
from
an
additional
10
to
200
percent
of
the
amount 
otherwise
payable. 
Most
state
laws
specify
that
employees
of
employers
who
fail
to
secure
compensation
as
required
are 
entitled
to
bring
an
action
for
damages
against
the
defaulting
employer
in
the
event
of
an
on-the-job 
injury
caused
by
the
employer’s
negligence.
In
most
states,
an
injured
employee
can
sue
the
defaulting 
employer
for
damages
as
well
as
claim
compensation
benefits;
in
others,
the
injured
worker
must
choose 
between
filing
a
lawsuit
based
on
negligence
and
collecting
statutory
benefits. 
Covered
Employments
In
every
state
except
Wyoming,
the
workers
compensation
act
applies
to
all
employments
except
those 
that
are
specifically
excluded;
Wyoming
takes
the
opposite
approach
of
listing
those
employments
that 
are
covered
by
the
act.
Generally,
exceptions
apply
to
very
small
employers,
employees
performing 
specified
types
of
work,
or
employees
who
work
on
a
casual
basis. 
Number
of
Employees
Employers
with
fewer
than
a
specified
number
of
employees
(typically
three,
four,
or
five)
are
exempt 
from
the
workers
compensation
law
in
14
states. 
Type
of
Work
Excluded
categories
of
employees
usually
include
domestic
employees,
agricultural
employees,
real 
estate
brokers
paid
on
commission,
and
“casual”
employments.
Of
these
excluded
categories,
only
the 
casual
worker
is
likely
to
be
of
concern
to
energy
industry
contractors.
Although
the
term
“casual 
employment”
is
defined
in
only
a
few
states’
laws,
it
is
generally
understood
to
mean
work
that
is
short 
term,
of
very
limited
scope,
and
not
part
of
the
employer’s
normal
operations.
For
example,
if
a
contractor
5hired
college
students
for
a
week
to
clean
up
an
equipment
yard
and
pressure
wash
the
equipment,
that 
would
probably
qualify
as
“casual
employment.” 
The
casual
employment
exemption
is
usually
phrased
something
like
“employments
that
are
casual
and 
not
in
the
usual
course
of
the
employer’s
business.”
That
is,
in
addition
to
being
casual,
the
work
must
be 
outside
the
contractor’s
normal
business
operations.
For
example,
if
a
company
hires
a
college
student
to 
design
an
Internet
website
for
the
company,
that
employment
may
be
considered
casual
since
the 
employment
is
very
short
term
and
the
contractor
is
not
in
the
business
of
designing
websites.
(Note
that 
this
exception
would
only
apply
if
the
applicable
state
law
exempts
casual
employments.) 
Employees
not
covered
by
the
act
retain
their
right
to
sue
for
damages
caused
by
the
employer’s 
negligence.
If
the
employer
has
purchased
a
standard
workers
compensation
policy
to
provide
benefits
for 
those
in
covered
employments,
the
employers
liability
portion
of
this
policy
will
respond
to
any
suits
by 
employees
in
exempted
employments.
However,
employers
with
one
or
more
employees
that
have
not 
purchased
a
workers
compensation
policy
because
none
of
the
employees
are
covered
by
the
act
probably 
have
an
uninsured
exposure
to
employers
liability
lawsuits.
(These
types
of
claims
are
nearly
always 
excluded
from
coverage
under
other—i.e.,
general
liability,
auto
liability,
etc.—insurance
policies.) 
Because
employers
liability
insurance
is
seldom
available
except
as
part
of
a
standard
workers 
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
(and,
with
respect
to
the
monopolistic
states
only,
under
a 
stop
gap
endorsement
to
a
general
liability
policy),
one
way
to
view
exemption
from
the
act
is
that
the 
state
in
question
is
granting
the
employer
permission
to
“go
bare”
with
respect
to
these
employments. 
However,
it
may
not
be
wise
for
employers
to
be
uninsured
against
the
possibility
of
lawsuits
brought
by 
injured
exempt
employees.
While
the
employee
must
prove
the
injury
was
the
result
of
the
employer’s 
negligence,
and
the
employer
usually
retains
common
law
defenses
(assumption
of
risk,
fellow
servant 
liability,
and
contributory
negligence)
in
such
cases,
defense
costs
alone
could
bankrupt
many
contractors. 
This
issue
is
discussed
in
more
detail
under
“Elective
Coverage”
below. 
Independent
Contractors
The
question
of
whether
a
particular
work
relationship
is
considered
an
employer-employee
relationship, 
as
opposed
to
a
principal-independent
contractor
relationship,
is
important
in
the
energy
industry.
State 
workers
compensation
laws
vary
as
to
their
specificity
on
this
point.
Many
are
completely
silent,
in
which 
case
common
law
principles
that
distinguish
between
an
employee
and
an
independent
contractor
would 
usually
govern,
unless
caselaw
in
the
state
in
question
has
established
exceptions
to
these
principles. 
Some
states
specify
that
independent
contractors
are
not
employees
and
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to 
injuries
sustained
by
independent
contractors.
However,
only
a
few
go
beyond
simply
stating
that 
independent
contractors
are
not
considered
employees
by
including
provisions
that
address
the
distinction 
between
an
employer-employee
relationship
and
a
principal-independent
contractor
relationship
for 
purposes
of
workers
compensation. 
Employee
Leasing
States
take
varied
approaches
toward
employee
leasing.
Some
states
require
licensing
and
registration. 
The
majority
of
states
have
implemented
statutes
related
to
the
placement
of
workers
compensation 
insurance
for
leased
employees.
Approximately
40
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
have
provisions
in
the 
workers
compensation
act
regarding
employee
leasing.
These
provisions
normally
focus
on
determining 
the
statutory
employer
and
applying
exclusive
remedy
in
an
employee
leasing
arrangement.
A
like 
number
of
other
states
address
these
same
issues
through
state
statute,
separate
from
the
workers 
compensation
act,
or
through
administrative
rules.
Employee
leasing
is
discussed
further
in
Chapter
3. 
Sole
Proprietors,
Partners,
Executive
Officers,
and
Limited
Liability
Companies
In
most
states,
sole
proprietors
and
partners
are
not
covered
employees
under
the
workers
compensation 
act,
but
they
may
elect
to
be
covered.
In
some
states,
the
option
to
be
covered
only
applies
if
the 
business’s
other
employees
are
covered
under
the
act,
either
by
law
or
by
the
employer’s
election.
For 
executive
officers
of
a
corporation,
the
opposite
general
rule
applies;
in
most
states,
officers
of
a 
corporation
(including
the
executive
officers)
are
covered
but
may
elect
to
be
excluded
under
the
act.
6Many
states
allow
only
executive
officers
to
exempt
themselves;
others
do
not
specify
which
officers
can 
exempt
themselves
but
allow
only
a
specified
number
of
corporate
officers
to
be
exempt.
(Which
officers 
are
considered
executive
officers
may
or
may
not
be
spelled
out
in
the
act.)
A
number
of
states
address 
the
status
of
limited
liability
company
(LLC)
members
and
managers.
The
LLC,
which
is
a
relatively
new 
type
of
legal
entity,
is
a
hybrid
that
combines
features
of
both
corporations
and
partnerships.
As
a
result, 
some
jurisdictions
view
LLC
members
and
managers
as
partners
while
others
treat
them
as
executive 
officers. 
Keep
in
mind
that,
in
many
states,
those
who
voluntarily
exempt
themselves
from
coverage
under
the
act 
retain
the
right
to
sue
the
employer
for
damages
caused
by
the
employer’s
negligence.
However,
the 
standard
endorsement
used
to
exempt
corporate
officers
and
others
from
coverage
under
the
employer’s 
workers
compensation
insurance
policy
eliminates
both
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability 
coverage
for
injury
to
these
individuals. 
Elective
Coverage
In
most
states,
employers
not
subject
to
the
act
can
voluntarily
elect
to
be
covered.
In
so
doing,
they 
become
obligated
to
pay
statutory
benefits
for
covered
injuries
sustained
by
covered
employees
without 
regard
to
fault;
they
also
obtain
(at
least
limited)
protection
from
lawsuits
brought
by
injured
employees 
due
to
the
exclusive
remedy
provision.
A
few
states
allow
employees
in
exempt
employments
to
remain 
exempt
even
when
the
employer
has
elected
to
provide
coverage,
usually
by
notifying
the
employer
in 
writing
prior
to
the
injury;
otherwise,
the
employee
is
presumed
to
have
accepted
the
provisions
of
the 
act. 
In
the
majority
of
states,
all
an
exempt
employer
must
do
to
elect
to
be
subject
to
the
act
is
purchase 
insurance
that
clearly
covers
the
otherwise
exempt
employments.
Some
states
also
require
notification
of 
voluntary
election
to
the
workers
compensation
administrator. 
Suits
Against
Third
Parties
Every
state
allows
the
employee
and
the
employer
to
pursue
an
action
against
a
third
party
responsible
for 
a
workplace
injury.
(The
employer’s
right
of
action
is
transferred,
i.e.,
“subrogated,”
to
the
workers 
compensation
insurer
when
benefits
are
paid;
the
insurer
can
then
file
a
claim
against
the
responsible 
party.)
The
majority
of
states
allow
the
employee
to
collect
workers
compensation
benefits
and
also
sue 
the
responsible
third
party,
but
in
a
few
states
injured
employees
can
do
only
one
or
the
other. 
All
states
allow
the
employer/insurer
to
recover
workers
compensation
benefits
paid
when
an
employee 
successfully
obtains
damages
or
a
settlement
from
a
third
party.
Some
states
allow
the
employee
first 
recourse
against
the
third
party,
with
the
employer/insurer
having
a
lien
on
the
recovery;
other
states 
allow
for
joint
recourse
by
the
parties
involved;
and
a
few
states
provide
for
direct
recovery
by
the 
employer/insurer.
The
states
also
take
varied
approaches
regarding
how
the
recovered
funds
are 
distributed
between
the
employee
and
the
employer/insurer. 
Waiver
of
Subrogation
Companies
frequently
are
required
to
obtain
a
waiver
of
subrogation
from
various
insurers,
including
the 
workers
compensation
insurer.
Many
insurers
resist
granting
waivers
of
subrogation
or
charge
a 
potentially
hefty
premium
for
doing
so. 
The
workers
compensation
insurer’s
ability
to
waive
its
right
of
subrogation
is
specifically
addressed
in 
only
a
few
state
statutes.
Kansas,
Kentucky,
Missouri,
New
Hampshire,
and
New
Jersey
explicitly 
disallow
waivers
of
subrogation.
(In
Kansas
and
Missouri,
waivers
of
subrogation
are
barred
only
in
the 
construction
industry.)
Companies
operating
in
these
states
should
be
careful
not
to
agree
to
provide
a 
workers
compensation
waiver
of
subrogation. 
Injuries
Not
Covered
Nearly
all
state
workers
compensation
laws
designate
a
few
types
of
injuries
as
not
compensable.
For 
example,
the
majority
of
states
stipulate
that
neither
intentionally
self-inflicted
injuries
nor
injuries
7sustained
in
an
attempt
to
injure
someone
else
are
compensable.
Some
states
prohibit
compensation
for 
injuries
sustained
while
the
employee
was
committing
a
crime.
The
purpose
of
exclusions
such
as
these
is 
to
remove
from
coverage
injuries
that
are
not
truly
the
result
of
the
employment. 
Significant
to
the
energy
industry,
some
states
provide
that
injuries
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
employee’s 
willful
failure
to
use
a
safety
device
are
not
compensable.
This
provision
may
be
inapplicable
if
the
use
of 
the
safety
device
was
not
actively
and
consistently
enforced. 
Most
states
exclude
injuries
caused
by
the
employee’s
drug
use
or
intoxication
with
alcohol,
although
the 
specifics
of
the
laws
regarding
such
injuries
vary.
In
some
states,
drug-related
injuries
are
excluded
only 
if
the
injury
is
caused
by
use
of
an
illegal
drug
or
narcotic;
in
others,
it
applies
to
injuries
caused
by
the 
employee’s
use
of
any
controlled
substance,
except
when
prescribed
by
a
physician
and
used
in 
accordance
with
the
physician’s
instructions.
Most
states
provide
only
that
injuries
“caused
by”
the 
employee’s
intoxication
or
drug
use
are
not
compensable.
However,
some
require
that
the
injury
be 
“proximately
caused
by”
the
employee’s
intoxication
or
drug
use,
or
that
the
impaired
condition
was
“a 
substantial
factor”
in
causing
the
injury. 
A
number
of
state
workers
compensation
laws
prohibit
compensation
for
injuries
caused
by
the 
employee’s
willful
misconduct
or
willful
negligence.
Although
what
constitutes
willful
misconduct
is 
seldom
spelled
out
in
the
act,
this
provision
alone
would
probably
be
sufficient
to
eliminate
coverage
for 
injuries
caused
by
the
employee’s
intoxication
with
alcohol
or
drug
use
in
those
states
that
do
not
have
a 
specific
alcohol
or
drug
use
provision. 
Also
specifically
not
covered
in
a
number
of
states
are
injuries
suffered
while
the
employee
was 
participating
in
voluntary
recreational
activities,
provided
that
participation
was
not
a
job
requirement. 
However,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
provision
addressing
these
situations,
injuries
suffered
during 
participation
in
voluntary
recreational
activities
(such
as
a
softball
game
at
a
company
picnic
or
bowling 
on
a
company-sponsored
bowling
team)
would
probably
not
be
considered
to
have
arisen
out
of
or
in
the 
course
of
employment
in
most
states.
Likewise,
while
some
states
specifically
exclude
injuries 
intentionally
inflicted
by
a
third
party
or
coworker
for
personal
reasons,
or
reasons
not
related
to 
employment,
normally
these
types
of
injuries
would
not
be
deemed
compensable
even
without
such 
provisions. 
Occupational
Disease
Energy
industry
workers
exposed
to
dust,
hydrogen
sulfide
gas,
drilling
fluids,
and
a
variety
of
chemicals 
may
develop
occupational
diseases
of
the
lungs,
skin,
and
other
organs.
Hazardous
noise
levels
may 
expose
workers
to
hearing
loss. 
Occupational
disease
is
a
thorny
issue,
as
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
when
the
injury
took
place
and 
whether
the
illness
is
really
the
result
of
the
occupation
or
the
result
of
other
factors.
A
majority
of
states 
have
specific
provisions
relating
to
silicosis.
Some
also
have
specific
provisions
relating
to
occupational 
hearing
loss. 
Provisions
defining
occupational
diseases,
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
are
compensable,
are
too 
detailed
to
summarize
in
outline
form.
However,
the
general
rule
is
that
for
occupational
diseases
to
be 
compensable,
there
must
be
a
direct
causal
link
between
the
employment
and
the
disease.
The
majority
of 
states
assign
liability
for
a
worker’s
occupational
disease
to
the
last
employer
in
whose
employment
the 
employee
was
exposed
to
the
hazards
that
caused
the
occupational
disease.
(Some
of
these
states
allow 
the
last
employer
to
recover
from
prior
employers
in
certain
situations.) 
Most
states
impose
time
limitations
for
the
filing
of
occupational
claims.
Such
limitations
normally
begin 
on
the
date
a
diagnosis
is
confirmed
or
the
date
the
employee
knew
or
should
have
known
through
due 
diligence
that
the
disease
was
work
related.
Further,
in
the
case
of
death,
some
states
require
that
the 
death
occurred
within
a
specified
amount
of
time
following
last
exposure
to
the
condition
giving
rise
to 
the
disease. 
Extraterritorial
Application
8Most
workers
compensation
statutes
specify
the
circumstances
under
which
that
state’s
act
applies
to 
injuries
suffered
outside
the
state.
Usually,
these
circumstances
involve
when
the
contract
of
employment 
was
made
in
the
state
or
when
the
employment
is
principally
localized
in
the
state. 
Some
states
also
establish
a
time
limit
on
coverage
for
out-of-state
injuries;
the
most
common
limit
is 
about
6
months.
In
these
states,
an
employee
working
in
another
state
for
more
than
the
designated 
duration,
for
example,
6
months,
is
no
longer
entitled
to
benefits
in
the
home
state.
(However,
the 
employee
probably
is
entitled
to
the
compensation
in
the
state
in
which
he
or
she
is
currently
working.) 
In
certain
instances,
an
employee
who
is
injured
in
another
state
has
the
option
of
either
filing
under
the 
extraterritorial
provision
of
the
home
state
or
filing
under
the
workers
compensation
law
of
the
state
in 
which
the
injury
occurred.
When
faced
with
such
a
decision,
the
injured
employee
customarily
will
file
in 
the
state
with
the
higher
benefits. 
Another
issue
relating
to
extraterritorial
coverage
of
which
contractors
should
be
aware
is
that
time
limits 
on
coverage
for
out-of-state
injuries
are
particularly
significant
for
employers
operating
primarily
in 
monopolistic
fund
states
because
they
may
not
have
coverage
for
benefits
payable
under
other
states’ 
workers
compensation
laws. 
Some
states’
statutes
exempt
out-of-state
employers
and
employees
from
the
act
if
the
employer
has 
workers
compensation
insurance
that
covers
the
injury
under
another
state’s
law.
Usually,
this
provision 
is
conditioned
on
the
other
state
having
a
reciprocal
provision
that
exempts
out-of-state
employers
from 
the
application
of
its
act
under
similar
circumstances. 
By
purchasing
other
states
coverage
in
the
workers
compensation
policy,
the
employer
is
protected
in
the 
event
a
workers
compensation
claim
is
filed
in
a
state
in
which
it
has
not
purchased
workers 
compensation
insurance.
Other
states
coverage
is
discussed
further
in
Chapter
2. 
Workers
Compensation
Benefits
The
categories
of
workers
compensation
benefits
payable
to
an
injured
worker
or
the
worker’s
dependents 
are
medical,
disability,
rehabilitation,
and
death.
The
dollar
amounts
of
these
benefits,
as
well
as
other 
related
rules,
vary
considerably
from
state
to
state. 
Medical
Benefits
Medical
benefits
(payments
for
the
medical
treatment
of
an
injured
employee)
account
for
almost
half
of 
the
total
workers
compensation
benefit
payments
in
the
United
States.
Most
state
statutes
provide
for 
unlimited
medical
benefits
in
terms
of
both
dollar
amounts
and
duration.
In
the
few
states
that
impose 
limitations
on
medical
benefits,
these
limits
may
be
exceeded
upon
the
authorization
of
the
state’s 
workers
compensation
administrator. 
Disability
Benefits
The
purpose
of
disability
benefits
is
to
replace
the
worker’s
loss
of
income
or
earning
capacity
that
results 
from
a
compensable
injury.
The
four
classes
of
disability
are
temporary
total,
permanent
total,
temporary 
partial,
and
permanent
partial. 
•
Temporary
total
disability
is
the
most
common
type
of
disability.
An
employee
with
a
temporary 
total
disability
is
expected
to
recover
from
the
injury
and
return
to
employment
but
is
unable
to
do 
any
type
of
work
while
recovering.
The
amount
of
the
weekly
benefit
for
a
worker
with
a 
temporary
total
disability
is
set
by
state
statute.
It
is
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
the
worker’s 
weekly
wages
(usually
66
2/3
percent)
and
is
often
subject
to
a
minimum
and/or
maximum
dollar 
amount.
Some
states
also
place
a
limit
on
the
number
of
weeks
and/or
total
dollar
amount
an 
employee
can
collect
for
a
temporary
total
disability.
However,
most
states
will
pay
temporary 
total
disability
benefits
for
the
duration
of
an
employee’s
disability
without
limiting
the
total 
amount.
•
Permanent
total
disability
means
that
an
injury
is
suffered
that
leaves
the
employee
unable
to
do 
any
kind
of
work
for
the
remainder
of
his
or
her
life.
As
with
a
temporary
total
disability,
the
9weekly
benefit
is
a
percentage
of
the
employee’s
weekly
wages
and
is
subject
to
the
same 
minimum
and/or
maximum
weekly
payment.
The
majority
of
states
will
provide
permanent
total 
disability
benefits
for
life.
•
A
worker
with
a
temporary
partial
disability
can
still
do
some
work
but
is
unable
to
earn
his
or
her 
usual
wage
until
fully
recovered.
Compensation
for
a
temporary
partial
disability
is
usually 
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
difference
between
the
weekly
wage
earned
during
the
recovery 
period
and
the
weekly
wage
that
would
have
been
earned
had
no
injury
taken
place.
•
A
permanent
partial
disability
occurs
when
an
employee
suffers
an
injury
from
which
he
or
she 
will
never
recover,
but
the
injury
is
such
that
the
ability
to
work
is
only
partially
affected.
In
other 
words,
the
worker
can
still
do
some
work
but
his
or
her
earning
capacity
is
less
than
it
would
be 
had
no
injury
occurred.
Most
states
have
developed
a
list
of
specific
injuries
and
corresponding
benefits,
which
is
used
to 
compensate
workers
with
the
more
common
permanent
partial
disabilities.
These
lists
of
injuries, 
commonly
referred
to
as
“scheduled
injuries,”
generally
include
the
loss
or
loss
of
use
of
certain
specified 
body
members
(e.g.,
a
hand,
an
arm,
or
a
leg)
and
the
loss
of
hearing
or
eyesight.
The
benefit
levels
for 
scheduled
injuries
vary
from
state
to
state.
A
number
of
states
have
moved
away
from
the
use
of
a 
schedule
of
injuries
to
compensate
workers
for
permanent
partial
disabilities.
The
most
common
approach 
used
by
these
states
for
the
determination
of
benefits
is
to
base
compensation
on
the
percentage
the 
disability
bears
to
total
permanent
disability.
In
states
utilizing
a
schedule
of
injuries,
injuries
not
covered 
by
the
schedule
are
normally
compensated
in
the
manner
just
discussed
or
like
temporary
partial
disability 
(a
percentage
of
the
wage
lost). 
Regardless
of
the
type
of
disability,
all
states
have
a
waiting
period
during
which
disability
benefits
are 
not
payable.
The
length
of
the
waiting
period
varies
from
state
to
state,
but
3
days
is
the
most
common 
time
period.
Essentially,
the
waiting
period
acts
as
a
deductible
and
eliminates
the
administrative
work
for 
small
claims.
It
is
important
to
note
that
the
waiting
period
applies
only
to
disability
benefits;
medical 
benefits
are
immediately
payable.
Normally,
if
the
disability
lasts
beyond
a
specified
number
of
weeks 
(usually
2
or
3),
retroactive
disability
benefits
will
be
paid
back
to
the
date
of
injury. 
Rehabilitation
Benefits
Although
early
workers
compensation
laws
did
not
provide
for
employee
rehabilitation,
most
state 
workers
compensation
laws
now
contain
specific
provisions
related
to
the
rehabilitation
of
injured 
workers.
These
provisions
generally
make
rehabilitation
and
reimbursement
for
rehabilitation-related 
expenses
(such
as
board,
lodging,
and
travel)
available
to
an
injured
worker.
While
most
states
specify 
that
such
rehabilitation
must
be
funded
directly
by
the
employer
or
its
insurer,
a
number
of
states
have
set 
up
special
state
funds
to
pay
for
rehabilitation
costs.
The
sources
of
these
funds
are
often
taxes
levied 
against
insurers
and
self-insurers
operating
in
the
state
and
federal
funds
granted
under
the
Rehabilitation 
Act
of
1973. 
Death
Benefits
If
a
worker
is
killed
and
the
death
arises
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment,
death
benefits
are
paid. 
These
benefits
consist
of
a
burial
allowance
and
a
weekly
income
benefit
designed
to
help
compensate 
those
dependent
on
the
lost
income.
The
amount
of
these
weekly
income
benefits
varies
from
state
to
state 
and
is
usually
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
the
weekly
wages
of
the
deceased
worker,
subject
to
a 
maximum
and
minimum
weekly
benefit.
There
is
often
a
time
limit
on
such
benefits,
with
the
children’s 
benefits
usually
ending
at
age
18
and
a
spouse’s
benefits
usually
ending
at
remarriage.

The
Workers
Compensation
and 
Employers
Liability
Policy
Chapter
Overview
and
Objectives
The
National
Council
on
Compensation
Insurance
(NCCI),
which
serves
as
the
filing
agency
and
rating 
organization
for
workers
compensation
insurance
in
the
majority
of
states,
promulgates
a
standard 
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance
policy
(WC
00
00
00
C).
The
2015
edition
of 
that
policy
is
currently
approved
for
use
in
all
of
the
46
states
that
allow
private
insurers
to
write
workers 
compensation
insurance,
plus
the
District
of
Columbia.
The
other
four
states
(North
Dakota,
Ohio, 
Washington,
and
Wyoming)
require
all
workers
compensation
insurance
to
be
purchased
from
a 
monopolistic
state
fund
or
qualify
as
a
self-insurer
in
the
states
that
allow
it.
Most
states
allow
insurers
to 
file
their
own
forms,
although
few
insurers
choose
to
do
so.
Consequently,
almost
all
workers 
compensation
policies
issued
in
the
United
States
are
written
on
the
2015
NCCI
form. 
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
recognize
the
scope
of
coverage
provided
under
the
standard,
unendorsed
workers
compensation 
and
employers
liability
policy,
and
2.
recognize
situations
or
circumstances
in
which
an
unmodified
workers
compensation
insurance 
policy
does
not
apply.
Although
the
standard
workers
compensation
policy
provides
only
two
basic
types
of
coverage,
the
policy 
is
divided
into
three
coverage
parts.
Part
One,
workers
compensation
insurance,
provides
coverage
for 
statutory
benefits
payable
under
the
laws
of
the
covered
states
specified
in
the
policy.
Part
Two, 
employers
liability,
provides
coverage
for
the
employer
for
liability
claims
by
employees
or
their 
dependents
that
fall
outside
the
protection
of
the
workers
compensation
law.
Part
Three,
other
states 
insurance,
provides
coverage
for
liabilities
payable
under
the
workers
compensation
statutes
of
specified 
additional
states. 
Coverage
typically
is
provided
for
all
states
in
which
the
insured
actually
performs
operations
under
Part 
One
of
the
policy,
but
employers
may
have
incidental
exposures
in
other
states,
such
as
when
an 
employee
is
injured
while
traveling
to
a
seminar
in
another
state.
Other
states
coverage
is
designed
to
pick 
up
these
incidental
liabilities
but
only
for
the
states
specified
on
the
policy’s
information
page.
(The 
“information
page”
is
the
declarations
page
on
which
the
named
insured,
its
address,
and
certain
other 
data
are
scheduled.) 
The
remaining
three
“parts”
of
the
policy
are
not
coverage
granting,
and
they
address
issues
such
as
the 
employers’
duties
when
an
injury
occurs,
how
the
premium
will
be
calculated,
and
other
policy 
conditions.
A
general
section
at
the
beginning
of
the
policy
clarifies
issues
such
as
who
is
an
insured 
under
the
policy,
what
locations
are
covered,
and
what
exactly
is
meant
by
the
terms
“workers 
compensation
law”
and
“state.” 
This
chapter
will
examine
the
scope
of
coverage
under
the
general
section
and
each
coverage
part
of
the 
standard
workers
compensation
insurance
policy. 
General
Section
The
general
section
begins
by
establishing
who
is
insured
under
the
policy
and
what
locations
are
covered
11and
defines
the
terms
“workers
compensation
law”
and
“state.”
The
use
of
such
terms
is
in
keeping
with 
most
“plain
English”
policies. 
Who
Is
an
Insured
The
“insured”
is
the
employer
listed
in
item
1
of
the
information
page.
An
employer
can
be
an
individual, 
partnership,
joint
venture,
association,
corporation,
or
the
legal
representative
or
trustee
of
the
insured.
If 
the
listed
employer
is
a
partnership,
each
individual
partner
is
insured
but
only
in
his
or
her
“capacity
as 
an
employer
of
the
partnership’s
employees.”
This
means
that
if
one
of
the
partners
has
household 
employees
or
is
involved
in
another
business
entity
other
than
the
partnership
named
on
the
information 
page,
that
partner
is
not
an
insured
with
respect
to
benefits
or
damages
owed
to
those
other
employees.
If 
the
insured
is
a
joint
venture,
only
the
joint
venture
entity
is
covered.
If
so
desired,
the
individual
entities 
that
form
the
joint
venture
can
also
be
made
insureds
by
attaching
the
joint
venture
as
insured 
endorsement
(WC
00
03
05). 
Neither
corporate
officers
nor
any
other
of
the
contractor’s
employees
are
insureds
under
the
standard 
workers
compensation
policy.
This
means
that
the
employers
liability
portion
of
the
policy
does
not 
provide
coverage
for
any
suits
by
an
injured
employee
against
a
coemployee
(including
a
corporate 
officer).
Although
most
states
allow
an
employee
to
sue
another
employee
in
connection
with
workplace 
injury
only
if
the
injury
was
intentional
or
the
result
of
gross
negligence,
some
states
place
no
restrictions 
on
lawsuits
against
coemployees.
Where
coemployee
lawsuits
are
permitted,
employees
meeting
the 
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy’s
definition
of
“executive
officer”
have
coverage
under
the 
CGL
policy.
Coverage
for
other
specified
employees
can
be
added
to
the
CGL
policy
by
endorsement. 
The
question
of
whether
employees
are
“insureds”
under
a
workers
compensation
policy
(and
therefore 
are
covered
for
any
liability
that
might
be
imposed
on
them
in
connection
with
a
work-related
injury
to 
another
employee)
is
entirely
different
from
the
question
of
which
employees
are
entitled
to
receive 
workers
compensation
benefits.
Under
the
workers
compensation
law
of
most
states,
executive
officers
of 
a
corporation
(generally
defined
as
the
president,
vice
presidents,
secretary,
and
treasurer)
are
eligible
to 
receive
benefits
in
the
event
of
compensable
injury
or
disease.
However,
many
states
allow
an
executive 
officer
to
elect
not
to
be
covered.
On
the
other
hand,
partners
and
sole
proprietors
usually
are
not
eligible 
to
receive
benefits
but
can,
in
many
states,
elect
to
be
covered.
The
treatment
of
members
and
managers 
of
limited
liability
companies
(LLCs)
varies
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
since
an
LLC
is
a
hybrid
of
a 
corporation
and
a
partnership.
Some
jurisdictions
consider
them
executive
officers
while
other 
jurisdictions
treat
them
as
partners. 
Although
there
is
no
reference
in
the
policy
to
whether
more
than
one
entity
may
be
insured
under
a 
policy,
most
states
allow
the
combining
of
certain
entities
under
one
workers
compensation
policy. 
Briefly,
combinable
entities
are
those
that
share
a
common
majority
ownership
interest.
Common 
majority
interest
exists
when
the
same
person,
group
of
persons,
or
corporation
owns
more
than
50 
percent
of
each
entity
or
when
one
entity
owns
a
majority
interest
in
another
entity,
which
in
turn
owns
a 
majority
interest
in
a
third
entity.
There
is
no
limit
to
the
number
of
entities
that
may
be
combined,
but 
each
entity
must
be
separately
identified,
classified,
and
rated. 
Additional
Insureds
Since
the
sole
purpose
of
the
workers
compensation
policy
is
to
cover
injuries
to
the
insured’s
employees, 
it
is
not
appropriate
for
one
party
to
a
contract
(e.g.,
the
owner
of
a
drilling
project)
to
require
the
other 
party
(e.g.,
a
contractor)
to
provide
additional
insured
status
under
the
workers
compensation
policy
(as
is 
commonly
done
with
general
liability
insurance).
If
this
were
to
occur,
the
additional
insured
project 
owner
would
be
covered
for
injuries
to
its
own
employees—unrelated
to
the
contractor’s
operations
for 
the
project
owner—under
the
contractor’s
workers
compensation
policy.
Further,
adding
a
project
owner 
to
a
workers
compensation
policy
would
almost
always
violate
the
General
Rule
3-A-5
of
the
NCCI
Basic 
Manual
for
Workers
Compensation
and
Employers
Liability
Insurance
,
which
states
that
“separate
legal 
entities
may
be
insured
in
one
policy
only
if
the
same
person,
or
group
of
persons,
owns
the
majority 
interest
in
such
entities.” 
However,
a
related
sort
of
coverage
problem
can
arise
when
an
insured
temporarily
lends
or
leases
its
12employees
to
someone
else,
such
as
when
a
contractor
rents
out
a
piece
of
equipment
with
an
operator.
To 
ensure
coverage
for
such
employees
under
the
contractor’s
workers
compensation
policy,
an
alternate 
employer
endorsement
(WC
00
03
01
A)
should
be
attached
to
the
insured’s
policy.
(See
the
discussion
of 
endorsements
in
Chapter
3
for
more
information
about
this
endorsement.) 
Covered
Workplaces
The
policy
covers
all
of
the
insured’s
workplaces
listed
on
the
information
page.
In
addition,
any
other 
workplace
that
is
located
in
a
state
listed
in
item
3.A.
of
the
information
page
is
covered
unless
the 
insured
has
purchased
another
workers
compensation
policy
to
cover
that
workplace
or
is
self-insured
for 
that
workplace. 
Some
states
allow
an
insured
with
multiple
locations
in
the
state
to
have
more
than
one
policy
(although 
all
operations
of
any
one
employer
at
a
single
location
usually
must
be
insured
in
one
policy,
to
avoid 
disputes
between
insurers
as
to
whose
policy
covers
a
particular
claim).
For
this
reason,
the
provision 
granting
automatic
statewide
coverage
for
all
workplaces
of
the
insured
contains
an
exception
for
any 
workplace
that
is
covered
under
another
workers
compensation
policy.
In
states
that
allow
employers
to 
insure
their
workers
compensation
liabilities
under
more
than
one
policy,
the
designated
workplaces 
exclusion
endorsement
(WC
00
03
02)
can
be
used
to
exclude
locations
covered
under
other
workers 
compensation
policies.
Situations
when
a
business
might
want
to
have
more
than
one
workers 
compensation
policy,
if
allowed,
include
the
following. 
•
When
the
insured
is
a
contractor
working
on
a
large
construction
project
subject
to
a
wrap-up
plan, 
a
single
consolidated
insurance
program
covering
all
parties
to
the
construction
project
for
that 
project
only
•
When
the
insured
has
several
operations,
one
of
which
is
a
high-risk
or
specialty
operation
(a 
nuclear
power
plant
or
a
hospital,
for
example)
that
is
best
insured
in
a
specialty
market
or
that 
only
specialty
markets
are
willing
to
insure
•
When
a
parent
company
has
several
subsidiary
companies
involved
in
very
different
types
of 
operations
The
workers
compensation
laws
of
all
states
except
North
Dakota
and
Wyoming
allow
a
private
employer 
to
self-insure
its
workers
compensation
liabilities
rather
than
purchase
workers
compensation
insurance, 
provided
that
the
employer
has
satisfied
the
applicable
self-insurance
requirements.
Therefore,
the 
provision
granting
automatic
statewide
coverage
for
all
workplaces
of
the
insured
in
states
listed
under 
item
3.A.
on
the
information
page
also
contains
an
exception
for
any
workplace
for
which
the
insured
is 
self-insured. 
Definitions
Regarding
Applicable
Law
“State”
is
defined
as
“any
state
of
the
United
States
of
America
and
the
District
of
Columbia.”
However, 
in
the
“monopolistic
fund
states,”
coverage
must
be
obtained
from
a
state
fund.
Consequently,
these
states 
should
not
be
entered
onto
the
policy’s
information
page
where
the
states
for
which
the
coverages
apply 
are
scheduled.
(See
the
discussion
of
stop
gap
endorsements
in
Chapter
3
for
information
on
how
to 
provide
employers
liability
coverage
in
the
monopolistic
states.) 
Note
that
this
definition
does
not
include
United
States
territories,
such
as
American
Samoa,
Guam, 
Puerto
Rico,
and
the
U.S.
Virgin
Islands.
Coverage
for
the
workers
compensation
law
of
a
U.S. 
territory—other
than
those
with
monopolistic
funds—can
be
provided
by
naming
the
territory
in
item 
3.A.
of
the
information
page. 
When
the
term
“workers
compensation
law”
is
used
in
the
policy,
it
means
the
workers
compensation
and 
occupational
disease
law
of
each
state
or
territory
named
in
item
3.A.
of
the
information
page.
It
is
the 
provisions
of
the
workers
compensation
law
of
the
applicable
state(s)
or
territory(ies),
not
the
terms
and 
conditions
of
the
policy,
that
determine
exactly
what
workers
compensation
coverage
is
provided. 
Unless
coverage
has
been
added
to
the
policy
by
endorsement,
no
coverage
is
provided
for
liability
13imposed
by
a
federal
workers
compensation-type
law. 
Part
One—Workers
Compensation
Insurance
As
noted
previously,
state
workers
compensation
statutes
generally
require
an
employer
to
make
specified 
benefit
payments
to
an
employee
(or
the
employee’s
family)
who
suffers
a
job-related
bodily
injury 
(including
death)
due
to
an
accident
or
occupational
disease. 
There
is
no
policy
limit
for
benefits
payable
under
the
workers
compensation
insurance
section
of
the 
policy.
Rather,
the
insurer’s
liability
is
equal
to
the
benefits
prescribed
under
the
applicable
state
workers 
compensation
law,
except
for
exemplary
or
punitive
damages,
fines,
or
penalties
in
excess
of
normal 
workers
compensation
benefits. 
Under
workers
compensation
insurance,
the
insurer
agrees
to
“pay
promptly
when
due
the
benefits 
required
of
you
by
the
workers
compensation
law”
as
long
as
the
bodily
injury
or
the
last
exposure
to
the 
conditions
that
cause
or
aggravate
the
occupational
disease
occurs
during
the
policy
period.
Because
of 
this
provision,
a
workers
compensation
policy
can
cover
claims
made
long
after
its
expiration
date
and 
therefore
should
never
be
discarded. 
The
insurer
also
agrees
to
defend,
at
its
own
expense,
any
claim
or
suit
against
the
insured
that
is
payable 
under
the
policy.
However,
the
insurer
has
“the
right
to
investigate
and
settle”
these
claims
or
suits.
This 
is
an
important
provision
since
it
gives
the
insurer
the
right
to
settle
workers
compensation
claims
without 
the
insured’s
consent.
Some
employers
negotiate
a
claim
agreement
with
the
insurer
that
allows
them
to 
participate
in
claim
settlement
decisions,
especially
when
a
large
deductible
or
other
loss-sensitive
rating 
program
is
in
place. 
In
addition
to
benefits
payments
and
defense
costs,
the
insurer
also
agrees
to
pay
certain
expenses,
as 
shown
in
Exhibit
2.1. 
14Exhibit
2.1
 
Additional
Expenses
Paid
by
the
Insurer
under
Part
One
 
of
the
Workers
Compensation
Policy
•
Reasonable
expenses
incurred
at
the
insurer’s
request
(but
not
loss
of
earnings)
•
Premiums
for
bonds
to
release
attachments
and
for
appeal
bonds
•
Litigation
costs
taxed
against
the
insured
•
Interest
on
any
judgments
•
Expenses
incurred
by
the
insurer
The
payments
for
which
the
insured
will
be
responsible
are
also
delineated.
The
insured
is
responsible
for 
any
payment
“in
excess
of
the
benefits
regularly
provided
by
the
workers
compensation
law.”
This 
includes
the
following. 
•
Excess
payments
that
must
be
made
because
of
the
insured’s
serious
and
willful
misconduct.
For 
example,
there
would
be
no
coverage
for
punitive
or
exemplary
damages
that
must
be
paid
in 
addition
to
regular
workers
compensation
benefits
because
an
insured
intentionally
injures
an 
employee.
•
Excess
payments
required
because
the
insured
knowingly
employs
an
employee
in
violation
of
the 
law.
For
example,
suppose
the
insured
hires
a
minor
in
violation
of
the
law,
despite
knowing
that 
the
employee
is
underage,
and
the
minor
is
injured
on
the
job.
Many
states
require
an
employer
to 
pay
a
penalty
amount
in
addition
to
regular
workers
compensation
benefits
if
an
illegally
employed 
minor
is
injured
on
the
job.
This
additional
amount
is
not
covered
by
workers
compensation 
insurance.
•
Excess
payments
required
because
an
employee
is
injured
due
to
the
insured’s
failure
to
comply 
with
a
health
or
safety
law,
such
as
the
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Act
(OSHA).
•
Excess
payments
due
to
the
discharge
of,
coercion
of,
or
discrimination
against
an
employee
in 
violation
of
the
workers
compensation
law.
For
example,
many
states
require
an
employer
to
pay
a 
penalty
in
addition
to
regular
workers
compensation
benefits
if
it
is
found
guilty
of
retaliatory 
discharge
(i.e.,
discharging
an
employee
simply
because
the
employee
filed
a
workers 
compensation
claim).
The
workers
compensation
policy
provides
no
coverage
for
this
type
of 
penalty.
In
general,
this
provision
makes
clear
that
the
insurer
has
no
intention
of
being
responsible
for
any 
punitive
or
exemplary
damages.
If
the
insurer
does
pay
charges
that
are
in
excess
of
the
regular
benefits 
required
by
the
workers
compensation
law
on
behalf
of
the
insured,
the
insured
must
promptly
reimburse 
the
insurer. 
In
the
event
that
benefits
payments
are
made
to
an
injured
employee,
the
insurer
has
the
insured’s
rights, 
as
well
as
the
injured
employee’s
rights,
to
recover
the
benefit
payments
from
any
liable
party. 
Furthermore,
the
insured
is
obligated
to
“do
everything
necessary
to
protect
those
rights
for
us
and
to
help 
us
enforce
them.”
This
condition
has
become
increasingly
important
in
recent
years
as
workers 
compensation
insurers
have
exercised
their
subrogation
right
more
frequently. 
Unlike
the
subrogation
clause
of
most
general
liability
and
property
insurance
policies,
the
workers 
compensation
policy
does
not
imply
permission
for
the
insured
to
waive
its
right
of
recovery
against
a 
third
party
before
a
loss. 
Subcontractors
In
most
states,
the
workers
compensation
statute
specifies
that
contractors
are
liable
for
workers 
compensation
benefits
to
the
injured
employee
of
an
uninsured
subcontractor.
Although
the
upper-tier 
contractor’s
workers
compensation
policy
will
respond
to
such
a
claim
(the
obligation
arises
out
of
the 
statute,
and
the
policy
agrees
to
pay
the
contractor’s
statutory
liabilities),
the
insurer
will
retroactively
15adjust
the
insured
contractor’s
premium
to
reflect
this
increased
exposure.
Normally,
this
will
be
done
by 
adding
the
uninsured
subcontractor’s
payrolls
for
that
project
to
the
insured
contractor’s
premium
base
at 
the
year-end
audit.
In
fact,
Rule
2-H
of
the
NCCI
Basic
Manual
provides
that
in
those
states
where
the 
workers
compensation
laws
make
a
contractor
responsible
for
the
payment
of
benefits
to
the
employees
of 
its
uninsured
subcontractors
when
the
contractor
cannot
furnish
evidence
that
a
subcontractor
has
workers 
compensation
insurance,
the
auditor
can
automatically
add
those
payrolls
to
the
contractor’s
premium 
base.
For
these
reasons,
contractors
should
be
diligent
about
requiring
certificates
of
insurance,
or
some 
other
evidence
of
coverage,
from
all
subcontractors
and
requiring
updated
certificates
when
the
policies 
listed
on
the
certificate
expire. 
Part
Two—Employers
Liability
Insurance
Despite
the
exclusive
remedy
provision
in
most
states’
workers
compensation
laws,
sometimes 
work-related
injuries
result
in
claims
for
“damages”
that
are
outside
the
prescribed
workers
compensation 
benefits.
For
example,
some
states
exclude
certain
employees—such
as
temporary
or
seasonal 
workers—from
coverage
under
the
statute,
so
unless
coverage
has
been
voluntarily
extended
to
these 
employees,
they
are
free
to
file
claims
outside
the
workers
compensation
system.
Likewise,
claims
arising 
out
of
a
covered
employee’s
injury
but
filed
by
someone
else,
such
as
the
employee’s
spouse
or
child,
do 
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
workers
compensation
statute. 
Part
One
(workers
compensation)
of
the
standard
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
insurance 
policy
will
not
respond
to
claims
outside
the
workers
compensation
statute,
but
Part
Two,
employers 
liability
insurance,
will
respond
to
these
claims.
Because
(most)
claims
arising
out
of
injury
to
an 
employee
are
excluded
under
the
commercial
general
liability
policy,
this
is
the
only
source
of
coverage 
employers
have
for
such
claims.
The
following
Exhibit
contains
some
examples
of
claims
that
would
be 
covered
under
employers
liability
insurance. 
16Exhibit
2.2
 
Types
of
Claims
Covered
under
Part
Two—Employers
Liability
•
Suit
filed
by
an
injured
employee
who
is
excluded
under
workers
compensation
law
•
Suit
brought
by
an
injured
employee
whose
employer
is
not
subject
to
workers 
compensation
law
because,
for
example,
its
workforce
is
so
small
•
Suit
filed
by
an
injured
employee
whose
employer
has
elected
not
to
accept
the
workers 
compensation
law
in
one
of
the
two
states
that
allow
employers
to
opt
out
•
Suit
filed
by
an
injured
employee’s
spouse,
claiming
loss
of
consortium
(e.g.,
sexual 
relations,
companionship,
and
help
in
performing
household
chores
and
maintenance)
Coverage
Criteria
Employers
liability
insurance
applies
to
bodily
injury,
including
death,
by
accident
or
disease.
For
a 
bodily
injury
to
be
covered,
the
following
criteria
must
be
met. 
•
The
bodily
injury
must
“arise
out
of
and
in
the
course
of”
the
employee’s
employment
with
the 
insured.
•
The
injured
worker’s
employment
must
be
necessary
or
incidental
to
the
insured’s
work
in
a
state 
or
territory
for
which
Coverage
A
has
been
activated
by
its
being
listed
on
the
information
page.
•
If
the
bodily
injury
is
caused
by
an
accident,
the
accident
must
occur
during
the
policy
period.
•
If
the
bodily
injury
is
caused
by
disease,
the
disease
must
be
caused
or
aggravated
by
the 
conditions
of
the
employment.
In
addition,
the
employee’s
last
day
of
last
exposure
to
the 
conditions
that
cause
or
aggravate
the
bodily
injury
or
disease
must
occur
during
the
policy
period.
•
The
suit
for
damages
must
be
brought
in
the
United
States,
its
territories
or
possessions,
or
Canada.
Although
the
policy
applies
to
all
employers
liability
claims
not
specifically
excluded,
it
explicitly
grants 
coverage
for
the
following
four
common
types
of
employers
liability
claims. 
•
Third-party-over
suits
•
Loss
of
consortium
suits
•
Dual
capacity
suits
•
Consequential
bodily
injury
suits
Third-Party-Over
Suits
“Third-party-over”
suits
are
filed
by
a
third
party
seeking
indemnity
because
it
was
held
liable
for
an 
employee’s
injury.
Suppose,
for
example,
that
an
employee
is
injured
while
using
a
piece
of
machinery 
that
the
employer
has
not
properly
maintained.
Despite
payment
of
benefits
payable
under
workers 
compensation
law,
the
employee
sues
the
manufacturer
of
the
equipment
who,
in
turn,
sues
the
employer 
for
contributory
negligence.
Tort
laws
vary
from
state
to
state.
The
differences
in
these
laws
will
affect 
the
potential
for
a
third-party-over
action
and
the
results. 
Loss
of
Consortium
Suits
Loss
of
consortium
suits
are
lawsuits
filed
by
an
injured
employee’s
spouse
for
loss
of
the
“services”
of 
his
or
her
spouse.
Many
state
courts
have
held
that
the
spouse
of
the
injured
employee
has
the
right
to
sue 
and
recover
against
the
employer
even
if
the
injured
employee
is
also
receiving
workers
compensation 
benefits
for
his
or
her
disability. 
Dual
Capacity
Suits
Dual
capacity
suits
are
those
in
which
the
employer
is
sued
for
its
involvement
in
the
injury
other
than
as
17the
employer.
For
example,
if
a
site
preparation
contractor
manufactures
a
piece
of
equipment
that
leads 
to
an
injury,
it
can
be
sued
in
its
capacity
as
a
product
manufacturer,
in
addition
to
being
liable
under
the 
workers
compensation
law.
However,
an
increasing
number
of
states
have
begun
to
permit
dual
action 
suits
only
when
the
employer
has
a
dual
corporate
persona—that
is,
when
the
employer
has
more
than
one 
business
and
the
employee’s
injury
stems
from
the
operations
of
another
of
the
employer’s
businesses. 
Consequential
Bodily
Injury
Suits
Consequential
bodily
injury
suits
are
lawsuits
filed
by
a
family
member
for
injury
suffered
as
a 
consequence
of
the
employee’s
injury.
For
example,
the
spouse
of
a
severely
injured
employee
might 
suffer
a
heart
attack
or
a
nervous
breakdown
upon
learning
of
the
injury.
Many
states
have
enacted 
legislation
to
limit
consequential
bodily
injury
suits. 
Exclusions
Employers
liability
insurance
contains
the
following
exclusions
shown
in
Exhibit
2.3. 
18Exhibit
2.3
 
Exclusions
Contained
in
Part
Two—Employers
Liability
•
Liability
assumed
under
a
contract
•
Punitive
or
exemplary
damages
•
Injury
to
illegally
employed
persons
(under
certain
circumstances)
•
Injuries
covered
by
the
workers
compensation
statute
or
similar
laws
•
Intentional
injury
•
Injuries
sustained
outside
the
United
States,
its
territories
or
possessions,
or
Canada, 
except
with
respect
to
citizens
of
the
United
States
or
Canada
who
are
temporarily 
outside
of
these
countries
•
Employment-related
practices
•
Fines
or
penalties
imposed
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
or
state
law
•
Injuries
covered
under
a
federal
compensation
act
Of
the
exclusions
shown
in
Exhibit
2.3,
the
following
have
important
implications
for
employers
in
the 
energy
industry. 
Contractual
Liability
Liability
assumed
in
a
contract
is
excluded
under
the
employers
liability
coverage
part.
The
contractual 
liability
exposure
relating
to
the
company’s
employees
is
a
third-party-over
action,
in
which
the
insured’s 
injured
employee
brings
a
suit
against
someone
else,
such
as
the
owner,
who
then
tenders
the
suit
back
to 
the
employer
under
a
hold
harmless
agreement.
The
employers
liability
coverage
will
not
respond 
because
of
this
contractual
liability
exclusion.
This
exclusion
is
included
to
coordinate
coverage
with
the 
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy,
which
does
cover
such
claims. 
If
a
third-party
defendant
settles
the
claim
and
then
attempts
to
recover
damages
from
the
employer
based 
on
negligence
or
any
other
grounds
other
than
a
contractual
assumption
of
risk,
the
employers
liability 
policy—not
the
CGL—will
respond
since
the
basis
for
the
claim
is
not
a
contractual
assumption
of 
liability
but
one
of
negligence
for
injury
to
the
contractor’s
employee.
This
dovetailing
of
coverage
avoids 
overlapping
coverage
between
the
two
policies
that
could
lead
to
disputes. 
Illegally
Employed
Persons
Both
exclusion
2
and
exclusion
3
of
the
employers
liability
section
can
serve
to
eliminate
coverage
with 
respect
to
injuries
to
illegally
employed
persons.
Under
no
circumstances
is
there
coverage
for
punitive 
damages
assessed
against
companies
for
injuries
to
illegally
employed
persons.
If
the
employer’s 
executive
officers
were
aware
of
the
illegal
employment,
even
“regular”
(compensatory)
damages
are 
excluded.
Given
the
number
of
immigrants
employed
in
the
energy
industry,
particularly
in
certain
areas 
of
the
country,
employers
must
be
diligent
to
ensure
these
workers
have
the
proper
authorization
to
work 
in
the
United
States. 
Injuries
Sustained
in
Foreign
Countries
Subject
to
an
important
exception,
injury
that
occurs
outside
the
United
States,
its
territories
or 
possessions,
and
Canada
is
not
covered.
The
exception
is
for
citizens
or
residents
of
the
United
States
or 
Canada
who
are
temporarily
outside
the
country.
Employers
liability
in
connection
with
injury
to
these 
employees
is
not
excluded,
even
if
it
occurs
outside
these
boundaries. 
Keep
in
mind,
however,
that
employees
temporarily
outside
the
country
may
or
may
not
be
entitled
to 
workers
compensation
benefits
if
they
are
injured
outside
the
country,
depending
on
the
extraterritoriality 
provisions
of
the
applicable
state
law.
Many
states
extend
benefits
to
employees
injured
outside
its 
borders
(whether
in
another
state
or
outside
the
country)
provided
that
the
contract
of
hire
was
made
in 
the
state
or
the
principal
localization
of
the
employment
is
in
the
state.
However,
circumstances
can
arise
19under
which
such
employees
would
not
be
entitled
to
state
workers
compensation
benefits.
In
that
event, 
the
employee
would
not
be
barred
from
filing
suit
under
common
law
for
injuries
sustained.
Normally, 
such
suits
would
be
covered
by
the
employers
liability
policy.
However,
with
the
exception
of
suits 
involving
injuries
sustained
by
citizens
or
residents
of
the
United
States
or
Canada
who
are
temporarily 
outside
these
countries
(including
U.S.
territories
or
possessions)
on
business,
these
claims
would
be 
excluded
from
coverage. 
Employers
undertaking
work
on
an
international
basis
should
be
alert
to
the
possibility
of
suits
that
fall 
within
the
scope
of
the
exclusion.
In
the
case
of
foreign
assignments
lasting
the
duration
of
a
major 
drilling
project,
there
may
be
no
coverage
at
all
under
the
employers
liability
policy
(nor
would
coverage 
be
available
under
the
CGL
or
any
of
the
employer’s
other
policies).
At
a
minimum,
disputes
as
to
how 
long
an
employee
can
be
considered
to
be
“temporarily”
outside
the
United
States
are
to
be
expected. 
Employers
operating
in
other
countries
(or
sending
employees
to
other
countries
on
business)
can
address 
these
potential
coverage
gaps
by
providing
voluntary
compensation
benefits
for
employees
for
whom
they 
are
not
statutorily
required
to
provide
coverage.
The
standard
voluntary
compensation
and
employers 
liability
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
03
11
A)
provides
that
if
a
covered
employee
is
injured
while 
temporarily
on
assignment
outside
the
United
States,
benefits
equivalent
to
those
provided
by
the
workers 
compensation
law
of
the
employee’s
home
state
are
provided. 
Employers
assigning
U.S.
nationals
to
work
indefinitely
outside
of
the
United
States
can
arrange
workers 
compensation
coverage
for
injury
to
these
employees
by
endorsement
or
under
a
separate
policy.
The 
NCCI
voluntary
compensation
endorsement
just
described
is
sometimes
used
to
provide
coverage
to 
workers
located
in
foreign
countries,
but
a
foreign
voluntary
workers
compensation
policy
or 
endorsement
is
preferred.
Foreign
voluntary
workers
compensation
endorsements
are
not
standard,
but 
manuscript
endorsements
are
in
widespread
use.
Typically,
a
foreign
workers
compensation
endorsement 
consists
of
the
text
of
the
NCCI
voluntary
compensation
endorsement
plus
language
providing
coverage 
for
endemic
disease
and
repatriation
expense.
(An
endemic
disease
is
one
that
is
peculiar
to
a
particular 
country.
Repatriation
expense
coverage
reimburses
the
insured
for
expenses
over
and
above
normal 
transportation
costs
when
it
is
necessary
to
bring
an
injured,
sick,
or
diseased
employee
back
to
the 
United
States.)
The
endemic
disease
coverage
under
a
foreign
workers
compensation
coverage 
endorsement
establishes
that
coverage
applies
to
injury
or
death
arising
out
of
endemic
disease
even
if
the 
disease
is
not
covered
under
the
workers
compensation
or
occupational
disease
law
of
the
designated 
state.
Because
the
extra
transportation
costs
associated
with
returning
an
injured,
ill,
or
deceased
worker 
to
the
United
States
can
be
enormous,
repatriation
expenses
are
considered
an
important
extension
of 
coverage. 
Employers
with
a
significant
number
of
employees
traveling
internationally
on
business
should
consider 
buying
this
coverage
for
all
employees
injured
outside
the
United
States,
regardless
of
whether
the 
assignment
is
temporary
or
permanent.
Some
foreign
workers
compensation
coverage
endorsements 
impose
a
sublimit
or
a
per
employee
limit
on
repatriation
expense
coverage.
Employers
should
attempt
to 
verify
that
this
limit
will
be
adequate
for
the
country
or
countries
involved. 
Employment-Related
Practices
The
intent
of
the
insurance
industry
is
for
workers
compensation
insurance
to
apply
to
employee 
on-the-job
injuries
covered
under
state
statutes
and
certain
closely
related
negligence
claims
resulting 
from
unintentional
employee
injuries
that
are
not
covered
under
state
acts.
Employment
practices
liability 
(EPL)
claims—such
as
discrimination,
wrongful
termination,
and
harassment—are
intentional
torts
that 
are
often
the
subject
of
federal
laws,
and
they
consequentially
fall
outside
the
philosophical
boundaries
of 
workers
compensation
insurance
envisioned
by
the
industry.
The
industry
has
developed
a
special 
insurance
product
known
as
employment
practices
liability
insurance
(EPLI)
to
cover
these
exposures, 
and
this
insurance
is
readily
available
from
many
liability
insurers. 
While
this
employers
liability
exclusion
will
probably
be
effective
in
precluding
coverage
for
EPL
claims 
under
employers
liability
coverage,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
policy’s
workers
compensation
coverage 
under
Part
One.
Consequently,
if
an
employee
sustained
injuries,
such
as
mental
anguish,
from
an 
employment
practice
deemed
compensable
under
applicable
state
workers
compensation
law,
Part
One
of
20the
policy
would
apply. 
A
similar
exclusion
is
commonly
attached
to
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policies
by
endorsement. 
Consequently,
employers
will
not
be
covered
for
most
employment
practices
liability
claims
unless 
specific
EPL
insurance
is
purchased. 
Injuries
Covered
under
a
Federal
Compensation
Act
The
standard
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
excludes
all
bodily
injuries
to
persons 
covered
by
federal
acts,
including
(but
not
limited
to)
the
Jones
Act,
the
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’ 
Compensation
Act,
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act,
and
the
Defense
Base
Act.
Thus,
unless 
coverage
for
liability
imposed
by
a
specific
federal
act
is
added
to
the
policy
by
endorsement,
as 
discussed
in
Chapters
5
and
6,
the
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
provides
no 
coverage. 
Limits
of
Liability
Unlike
the
workers
compensation
section
of
the
policy,
employers
liability
insurance
does
have
specific 
limits
of
liability.
The
following
three
separate
limits
apply. 
•
The
“bodily
injury
by
accident—each
accident”
limit
shown
on
the
information
page
is
the
most 
the
insurer
will
pay
for
all
claims
arising
out
of
any
one
accident,
regardless
of
how
many 
employee
claims
or
how
many
related
claims
arise
out
of
the
accident.
•
The
“bodily
injury
by
disease—each
employee”
limit
shown
on
the
information
page
is
the
most 
the
insurer
will
pay
for
damages
due
to
bodily
injury
by
disease
to
any
one
employee.
•
The
“bodily
injury
by
disease—policy
limit”
shown
on
the
information
page
is
the
most
the
insurer 
will
pay
for
employee
bodily
injury
by
disease
claims
in
the
policy
period
(usually
1
year), 
regardless
of
the
number
of
employees
who
make
such
claims.
While
the
basic
limits
are
$100,000
for
“bodily
injury
by
accident—each
accident,”
$100,000
for
“bodily 
injury
by
disease—each
employee,”
and
$500,000
for
“bodily
injury
by
disease—policy
limit,”
these 
limits
can
be
increased. 
Regardless
of
the
applicable
limit,
the
insured’s
umbrella
liability
policy
should
be
written
so
that
it
will 
attach
where
the
employers
liability
insurance
leaves
off,
providing
even
higher
limits
of
liability.
In 
conjunction
with
this,
any
umbrella
exclusions
related
to
the
operation,
ownership,
or
use
of
watercraft
or 
aircraft
should
have
exceptions
as
regards
injury
to
employees.
Exclusionary
endorsements
that
restrict 
coverage
as
respects
injury
to
employees,
such
as
for
occupational
disease,
should
be
avoided
to
the 
extent
possible. 
The
insurer
agrees
to
defend,
at
its
own
expense,
a
claim
against
the
insured
for
damages
payable
under 
employers
liability
insurance.
However,
the
insurer
has
no
duty
to
defend
a
claim
once
an
applicable
limit 
of
liability
has
been
exhausted. 
Part
Three—Other
States
Insurance
The
coverage
provided
by
workers
compensation
insurance
applies
only
to
claims
brought
under
the 
workers
compensation
laws
of
the
states
listed
on
the
information
page
as
being
covered.
Coverage
does 
not
apply
to
workers
compensation
claims
filed
in
other
states.
Even
when
all
states
in
which
the
insured 
has
operations
are
listed
on
the
information
page,
potential
coverage
gaps
exist.
For
example,
a
worker 
injured
while
traveling
in
another
state
on
business,
such
as
to
attend
an
educational
conference,
may 
qualify
for
benefits
under
that
state’s
workers
compensation
statute.
If
the
benefits
payable
in
that
state 
are
higher
than
those
payable
in
the
worker’s
resident
state,
he
or
she
may
opt
to
file
for
benefits
in
that 
state.
If
the
state
is
not
listed
in
item
3.A.,
the
workers
compensation
coverage
will
not
respond,
nor
will 
the
employer’s
liability
coverage
apply
since
that
portion
of
the
policy
specifically
excludes
benefits 
payable
under
a
workers
compensation
statute.
The
employer,
rather
than
the
insurer,
would
be 
responsible
for
paying
the
workers
compensation
claim. 
21Other
states
insurance
is
available
to
fill
such
coverage
gaps.
When
activated
as
discussed
below,
this 
section
of
the
standard
policy
makes
available
both
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability 
insurance
for
incidental
exposures
in
states
not
listed
in
item
3.A.
of
the
information
page
to
activate 
coverage
under
Part
One
(workers
compensation
insurance). 
The
states
for
which
other
states
coverage
is
desired
must
be
listed
in
a
different
space
(item
3.C.)
on
the 
information
page.
The
only
states
that
cannot
be
listed
are
the
monopolistic
fund
states
and
territories 
(North
Dakota,
Ohio,
Washington,
and
Wyoming,
plus
Puerto
Rico
and
the
U.S.
Virgin
Islands)
and 
states
already
designated
for
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
coverage
in
item
3.A.
If
a 
state
is
not
listed
in
item
3.C.,
no
protection
is
provided
for
incidental
exposures
in
that
state.
To
avoid
an 
uninsured
loss
due
to
clerical
oversight,
an
all-inclusive
statement
such
as
“all
states
and
U.S.
territories 
except
North
Dakota,
Ohio,
Washington,
Wyoming,
Puerto
Rico,
the
U.S.
Virgin
Islands,
and
states 
designated
in
item
3.A.
of
the
information
page”
should
be
inserted
here. 
For
various
reasons,
some
insurers
may
not
be
willing
or
able
to
write
blanket
other
states
coverage.
For 
example,
an
insurer
may
not
be
properly
licensed
to
do
so
in
some
states.
When
an
insurer
does
provide 
other
states
insurance
coverage
in
a
state
where
it
is
not
licensed
to
write
workers
compensation
coverage, 
it
may
be
unable
to
pay
benefits
directly
to
the
injured
employee,
which
leaves
the
contractor
with
the 
responsibility
of
paying
the
benefits.
However,
in
that
instance,
the
insurer
agrees
to
reimburse
the 
insured
for
the
benefits
required
by
the
workers
compensation
law
of
that
state. 
Other
states
insurance
is
designed
to
cover
only
incidental
exposures.
If
an
employer
begins
operations
in 
one
of
the
states
listed
for
other
states
insurance,
it
must
immediately
notify
the
insurer.
If
the
insurer 
agrees
to
write
the
coverage
for
the
operation,
it
will
delete
that
state
from
the
other
states
coverage
and 
add
it
to
item
3.A.
of
the
information
page,
thereby
providing
regular
workers
compensation
and 
employers
liability
coverage
in
that
state.
Employers
with
potential
incidental
operations
in
monopolistic 
fund
jurisdictions
may
be
able
to
close
the
gap
thereby
obtaining
coverage
under
a
manuscript
“extended 
protection
endorsement”
that
provides
for
reimbursement
of
benefits
required
of
the
insured
under
the 
workers
compensation
laws
of
these
jurisdictions.
Note
that
this
endorsement
does
not
serve
as
a 
replacement
or
substitute
for
workers
compensation
insurance
that
an
employer
must
secure
for
actual 
operations
in
monopolistic
states
via
their
fund
mechanisms. 
Part
Four—Your
Duties
If
Injury
Occurs
In
the
event
of
an
injury
that
may
be
covered
by
the
policy,
the
insured
has
the
following
duties. 
•
Notify
the
insurer
of
the
injury
“at
once”
when
an
injury
occurs
that
may
be
covered.
•
Provide
immediate
medical
attention
and
any
other
services
that
are
required
by
the
workers 
compensation
law.
•
Supply
the
insurer
or
the
insurer’s
agent
with
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
injured
parties
and 
the
witnesses
and
any
other
information
the
insurer
may
need.
•
Promptly
give
the
insurer
all
notices,
demands,
and
legal
papers
related
to
the
injury,
claim, 
proceeding,
or
suit.
•
Cooperate
with
the
insurer
and
assist
the
insurer,
if
necessary,
in
investigating,
settling,
or 
defending
any
claim,
proceeding,
or
suit.
•
Do
nothing
after
an
injury
occurs
that
would
interfere
with
the
insurer’s
right
to
recover
from 
others.
•
Make
no
voluntary
payments,
assume
no
obligations,
and
incur
no
expenses,
except
at
the 
insured’s
own
expense.
Part
Five—Premium
This
section
explains
how
the
policy
premium
is
determined.
It
describes
how
premiums
are
calculated 
according
to
the
insurer’s
manuals
of
rules,
loss
costs/rates,
rating
plans,
and
classifications
and
how
any
22changes
in
the
manual
can
be
applied
to
the
policy
if
authorized
by
law
or
a
governmental
agency 
regulating
workers
compensation
insurance. 
It
briefly
describes
the
classification
system
and
states
that
the
classifications
shown
on
the
information 
page
may
be
changed,
via
endorsement,
if
they
do
not
accurately
describe
the
work
the
insured
engages
in 
during
the
policy
period. 
The
premium
for
a
work
classification
is
determined
by
multiplying
the
rate
by
the
appropriate
premium 
basis.
Remuneration
is
the
most
common
premium
basis
for
workers
compensation.
It
includes
payroll 
and
all
other
remuneration
paid
or
payable
during
the
policy
period
for
the
services
of
all
the
insured’s 
executive
officers
and
employees
engaged
in
work
covered
by
the
policy.
If
an
officer
has
elected
not
to 
be
subject
to
workers
compensation
law,
the
policy
must
be
so
endorsed
and
that
officer’s
remuneration 
will
be
excluded. 
Remuneration
also
includes
amounts
paid
or
payable
to
all
other
persons
engaged
in
work
that
could 
make
the
insured
responsible
for
workers
compensation
benefits.
This
provision
is
necessary
because
the 
majority
of
state
workers
compensation
laws
specify
that
a
principal
(the
party
offering
the
contract)
will 
be
responsible
for
paying
workers
compensation
benefits
for
an
injured
employee
of
its
independent 
contractor
if
that
contractor
has
no
workers
compensation
coverage
.
Since
the
insurer
agrees
under 
workers
compensation
insurance
to
pay
all
benefits
required
of
the
insured
under
workers
compensation 
law,
it
will
be
responsible
for
making
benefit
payments
just
as
if
the
injured
employee
of
the
independent 
contractor
were
an
employee
of
the
insured.
Therefore,
the
insurer
is
entitled
to
extra
premium
based
on 
the
exposure
presented
by
an
independent
contractor
who
is
uninsured
for
workers
compensation.
If
the 
insured
maintains
payroll
records
of
the
independent
contractor’s
employees,
payroll
will
serve
as
the 
premium
basis.
However,
if
no
accurate
records
are
kept
as
to
the
separation
of
wages
and
materials
in
the 
contract
cost,
the
insurer
may
use
the
full
contract
cost
as
the
premium
basis. 
It
is
very
important
to
note
that
this
provision
is
subject
to
state
statutory
language
and
may
not
apply 
when
the
insured
can
supply
the
insurer
with
proof
that
the
independent
contractor
has
secured
proper 
workers
compensation
insurance.
Therefore,
it
is
generally
recommended
that
a
contractor
hire
only
those 
independent
contractors
who
furnish
their
own
workers
compensation
insurance
and
can
provide 
satisfactory
evidence
of
such
insurance
(i.e.,
a
certificate
of
insurance).
If
the
contractor
does
wish
to
hire 
an
uninsured
independent
contractor,
the
extra
premium
cost
could
be
considered
when
negotiating
the 
contract
cost.
If
so,
proper
payroll
records
should
be
maintained
to
avoid
paying
a
premium
based
on
the 
entire
contract
amount. 
The
premium
shown
on
the
information
page
is
merely
an
estimate.
The
final
premium
is
determined 
when
the
policy
period
ends
by
using
the
actual
premium
basis
(i.e.,
the
actual
remuneration
figures), 
rather
than
the
estimate
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
policy
period
and
the
proper
classifications
and
rates 
that
reflect
the
insured’s
work
during
the
policy
period.
If
the
final
premium
is
more
than
the
deposit 
premium
paid
by
the
insured,
the
insured
must
pay
the
insurer
the
balance.
If
it
is
less,
the
insurer
will 
refund
the
balance
to
the
insured. 
The
insured
is
obligated
to
keep
records
of
information
needed
to
compute
the
policy
premium.
In
order 
to
determine
the
final
premium,
the
insurer,
as
well
as
an
authorized
rating
organization,
has
the
right
to 
audit
the
insured’s
records
that
relate
to
the
policy.
These
records
include
ledgers,
journals,
registers, 
vouchers,
contracts,
tax
reports,
payroll
and
disbursement
records,
and
programs
for
storing
and
retrieving 
data.
The
insurer
has
the
right
to
conduct
these
audits
during
regular
business
hours
during
the
policy 
period
and
within
3
years
after
the
policy
period
ends. 
Part
Six—Conditions
This
section
of
the
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
contains
all
the
conditions 
applicable
to
both
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
coverage. 
According
to
the
inspection
provision,
the
insurer
has
the
right
to
inspect
the
insured’s
workplace
in
order 
to
help
determine
the
insurability
of
the
workplace
and
premium
to
be
charged.
However,
the
insurer
is
in 
no
way
obligated
to
perform
such
inspections.
If
an
inspection
is
performed,
the
passing
of
the
inspection
23is
not
a
warranty
of
safe
working
conditions.
Indeed,
the
provision
states
that
“we
do
not
undertake
to 
perform
the
duty
of
any
person
to
provide
for
the
health
or
safety
of
your
employees
or
the
public.”
The 
strong
wording
of
this
provision
is
an
attempt
by
the
insurer
to
avoid
liability
arising
out
of
a
negligent 
inspection
or
failure
to
perform
an
inspection. 
The
long-term
policy
provision
states
that
if
a
policy
is
issued
for
a
period
longer
than
1
year
and
16
days, 
the
provisions
of
the
policy
will
apply
as
if
a
new
policy
were
issued
on
each
anniversary
date.
For 
example,
suppose
the
policy
is
issued
for
a
2-year
period
and
the
rate
for
the
insured’s
work
classification 
changes
during
the
first
year
of
the
policy.
At
the
anniversary
date,
this
new
rate
would
be
used
in 
computing
the
insured’s
premium
for
the
second
year. 
The
insured’s
rights
or
duties
under
the
workers
compensation
policy
cannot
be
transferred
to
another 
without
the
written
consent
of
the
insurer.
For
example,
if
Contractor
A
sells
his
business
to
Contractor
B, 
he
cannot
assign
coverage
under
his
workers
compensation
policy
to
Contractor
B
unless
written
consent 
is
given
by
the
insurer.
However,
special
consideration
is
granted
in
the
case
of
the
death
of
an
insured.
If 
the
insured
dies
during
the
policy
period
and
written
notice
is
given
to
the
insurance
company
within
30 
days
after
the
date
of
such
death,
the
policy
will
cover
the
insured’s
legal
representative
as
insured. 
The
insured
can
cancel
the
policy
by
simply
mailing
or
delivering
an
advance
written
notice
to
the
insurer 
that
states
when
the
coverage
is
to
be
terminated.
In
order
to
cancel
the
policy,
the
insurer
must
give
the 
insured
not
less
than
10
days’
advance
written
notice.
However,
if
state
law
requires
a
longer
notice
of 
cancellation,
the
policy
is
changed
to
comply
with
that
law. 
Workers
compensation
policies
often
insure
two
or
more
employers
(e.g.,
subsidiary
companies).
The 
first
insured
named
in
item
1
on
the
information
page
is
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
other
insureds 
to
change
the
policy,
to
receive
unearned
premium,
and
to
give
and
receive
notice
of
cancellation.

Workers
Compensation
Endorsements
Chapter
Overview
and
Objectives
There
are
more
than
80
National
Council
on
Compensation
Insurance
(NCCI)
endorsements
that
can
be 
used
to
modify
the
2015
NCCI
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy.
There
are
four 
categories
of
NCCI
endorsements
that
alter
the
coverage
or
pricing
of
the
policy. 
•
Federal
coverage
endorsements
•
Maritime
coverage
endorsements
•
Other
coverage
and
exclusion
endorsements
•
Premium
endorsements
The
“other
coverage
and
exclusion
endorsements”
category
includes
all
coverage
endorsements
other
than 
the
federal
or
maritime
coverage
endorsements.
Within
it
are
a
number
of
endorsements
that
address 
employee
leasing
situations
and
a
few
that
address
voluntary
compensation
coverage,
but
otherwise
the 
endorsements
in
this
group
are
too
varied
to
label
meaningfully
with
a
single
descriptive
title. 
In
addition,
each
state
also
promulgates
standard
endorsements
for
use
only
in
that
state.
For
example, 
many
states
require
more
than
the
10-day
advance
written
notice
of
cancellation
that
is
required
by
the 
standard
policy.
A
state-specific
endorsement
is
needed
to
modify
the
policy’s
cancellation
provision
to 
conform
to
state
law. 
Manuscript
(or
nonstandard)
endorsements
also
are
used
by
individual
insurers
to
make
changes
in 
accordance
with
their
own
underwriting
standards.
In
some
cases,
manuscript
endorsements
are 
negotiated
between
a
specific
insured
and
the
insurer
for
exclusive
use
on
that
insured’s
policy. 
This
chapter
will
examine
some
of
the
more
frequently
used
other
coverage
and
exclusion
endorsements. 
•
Stop
gap
(employers
liability
coverage)
endorsement
•
Voluntary
compensation
and
employers
liability
coverage
endorsement
•
Sole
proprietors,
partners,
officers,
and
others
coverage
endorsement
•
Joint
venture

•
Alternate

endorsements
•
Defense
Base
Act
coverage
endorsement
•
Waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
•
Designated
workplaces
exclusion
endorsement
•
Terrorism
and
catastrophic
loss
endorsements
In
addition,
some
commonly
used
nonstandard
endorsements
are
reviewed,
including
broad
form
named 
insured
endorsement,
modified
notice
of
injury
endorsement,
and
extended
notice
of
cancellation 
endorsement. 
25The
maritime
coverage
endorsements
will
be
discussed
in
Chapters
5
and
6. 
On
completion
of
this
chapter
you
should
be
able
to 
•
recognize
the
purpose
and
effect
of
various
endorsements
available
for
attachment
to
a
workers 
compensation
policy.
Stop
Gap
(Employers
Liability)
Endorsement
Employers
whose
only
exposures
in
the
monopolistic
fund
states
(North
Dakota,
Ohio,
Washington,
and 
Wyoming)
are
necessary
and
incidental
to
their
work
in
other
states
would
have
employers
liability 
coverage
for
the
exposure
without
the
need
for
any
endorsement.
But
an
employer
with
operations
in
a 
monopolistic
state
that
has
purchased
the
required
state
workers
compensation
coverage
has
an
employers 
liability
coverage
gap
in
that
state.
The
coverage
afforded
by
the
policies
or
funds
of
these
jurisdictions 
does
not
apply
to
injuries
that
are
for
any
reason
not
covered
by
the
workers
compensation
law,
and
the 
insured’s
“regular”
workers
compensation
policy
will
not
respond
because
the
employment
is
not 
necessary
or
incidental
to
the
employer’s
work
in
a
covered
state. 
For
employers
with
actual
operations
in
monopolistic
states,
an
employers
liability
coverage
endorsement, 
often
called
a
“stop
gap”
endorsement,
eliminates
this
coverage
gap.
(NCCI
endorsement
WC
00
03
03
C 
applies
in
all
states
except
Ohio.
WC
34
03
01
accomplishes
the
same
purpose
for
Ohio
operations.) 
The
endorsement
adds
an
exclusion
for
bodily
injury
to
an
employee
when
the
insured
employer
is 
deprived
of
common
law
defenses
or
is
subject
to
a
penalty
because
of
failure
to
provide
workers 
compensation
coverage.
This
exclusion
is
intended
to
prevent
the
insured
from
attempting
to
use
the 
coverage
provided
by
the
endorsement
as
a
substitute
for
required
workers
compensation
insurance.
The 
Ohio
endorsement
also
adds
an
exclusion
for
bodily
injury
to
the
flying
crew
of
an
aircraft. 
The
primary
use
of
this
endorsement
is
to
provide
employers
liability
coverage
in
connection
with 
operations
in
a
monopolistic
state
fund
state.
However,
it
can
also
be
used
to
provide
employers 
liability-only
coverage
when
the
employer
is
not
subject
to
the
workers
compensation
law
of
a
given
state 
and
needs
only
employers
liability
coverage.
In
addition,
the
endorsement
can
be
used
when
the
employer 
is
self-insured
for
workers
compensation
benefits
but
elects
to
purchase
employers
liability
insurance 
from
an
insurer. 
Employers
operating
exclusively
in
one
of
the
monopolistic
fund
states
often
will
not
purchase
a
workers 
compensation
policy
from
the
standard
marketplace
since
they
have
no
exposure
outside
the
fund
state.
In 
this
situation,
a
stop
gap
endorsement
is
sometimes
attached
to
the
employer’s
commercial
general 
liability
policy
to
provide
coverage
within
the
home
state. 
Voluntary
Compensation
Endorsement
In
many
states,
certain
categories
of
employees
are
not
covered
by
workers
compensation
law.
Employees 
who
may
not
be
covered
under
the
workers
compensation
law
of
a
given
state
include
the
following. 
•
Domestic
workers
•
Agricultural
workers
•
Volunteers
•
Employees
injured
while
temporarily
outside
of
the
United
States
or
Canada
•
Employees
injured
while
on
indefinite
assignment
outside
of
the
United
States
or
Canada
In
addition,
some
states
do
not
require
employers
with
fewer
than
a
specified
number
of
employees
to 
provide
workers
compensation
benefits. 
If
an
employer
wishes
to
provide
statutory
benefits
for
these
employees,
a
voluntary
compensation
and 
employers
liability
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
03
11
A)
can
be
added
to
the
basic
workers 
compensation
policy.
Under
this
endorsement,
the
insurer
agrees
to
pay
such
employees
benefits
equal
to
26those
that
they
would
have
received
had
they
been
subject
to
workers
compensation
law.
If
the
injured 
employee
elects
to
collect
the
statutory
benefits,
he
or
she
is
required
to
sign
a
release
absolving
the 
contractor
and
the
insurer
from
further
liability.
If
the
employee
elects
to
file
a
suit
against
the
contractor, 
coverage
is
provided
under
employers
liability
insurance. 
The
voluntary
compensation
endorsement
is
also
used
to
cover
U.S.
employees
who
are
temporarily
on 
foreign
assignments.
Employees
injured
while
temporarily
outside
of
the
country
may
or
may
not
be 
entitled
to
workers
compensation
benefits,
depending
on
the
extraterritorial
coverage
provisions
of
the 
applicable
state
law.
Many
states
extend
benefits
to
those
injured
outside
its
borders
(whether
in
another 
state
or
outside
the
country)
provided
that
the
contract
of
hire
was
made
in
the
state
or
the
principal 
localization
of
the
employment
is
in
the
state.
However,
circumstances
can
arise
under
which
such 
employees
would
not
be
entitled
to
state
workers
compensation
benefits.
While
employers
liability 
coverage
does
apply
to
injuries
to
employees
temporarily
outside
of
the
United
States
or
Canada
(as
long 
as
the
employer
is
legally
liable
for
damages
as
a
result),
many
employers
prefer
to
address
this
exposure 
by
arranging
for
voluntary
compensation
benefits
coverage
using
this
endorsement. 
This
approach
is
often
less
expensive
than
providing
coverage
through
a
separate
foreign
workers 
compensation
policy.
If
such
an
employee
is
injured
in
the
course
of
a
foreign
assignment,
compensation 
benefits
equivalent
to
the
workers
compensation
benefits
that
would
have
been
received
in
the
employee’s 
home
state
are
provided.
However,
employees
who
are
hired
or
assigned
to
work
indefinitely
outside
the 
United
States
should
be
covered
under
a
foreign
workers
compensation
policy. 
Since
the
types
of
employees
to
be
covered
must
be
listed
in
this
endorsement,
the
phrase
“all
employees” 
should
be
used
in
order
to
avoid
any
denial
of
a
claim
due
to
clerical
oversight. 
Sole
Proprietors,
Partners,
Officers,
and
Others
The
workers
compensation
laws
of
certain
states
allow
sole
proprietors,
partners,
limited
liability 
members/managers,
and
executive
officers
to
elect
to
be
covered
under
the
state
workers
compensation 
law.
If
such
persons
elect
to
be
covered
by
the
law,
the
sole
proprietors,
partners,
officers,
and
others 
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
03
10)
must
be
attached
to
the
firm’s
workers
compensation
policy.
The 
individuals
who
elect
to
come
under
workers
compensation
law
can
be
designated
for
such
coverage
by 
naming
them
individually,
such
as
“John
Smith,
Vice
President,”
or
by
describing
them.
Examples
of 
such
descriptions
might
include
“all
partners”
or
“all
executive
officers
except
the
president.”
This 
endorsement
may
only
be
used
in
states
that
allow
such
elective
coverage.
Generally,
sole
proprietors, 
partners,
limited
liability
members/managers,
and
executive
officers
who
have
the
opportunity
to
elect
to 
come
under
workers
compensation
law
should
do
so. 
Other
state
workers
compensation
laws
state
that
sole
proprietors,
partners,
limited
liability 
members/managers,
and
executive
officers
are
expressly
covered
by
workers
compensation
statutes
but 
may
elect
to
be
excluded.
This
can
be
accomplished
by
adding
the
partners,
officers,
and
others
exclusion 
endorsement
(WC
00
03
08)
to
the
workers
compensation
policy.
As
with
the
previous
endorsement, 
individuals
may
be
designated
by
naming
them
or
by
describing
them.
This
endorsement
can
only
be
used 
when
the
exclusion
of
such
individuals
is
allowed
under
state
workers
compensation
law. 
Joint
Venture
as
Insured
Endorsement
When
two
or
more
employers
form
a
joint
venture
to
undertake
one
or
more
projects,
the
workers 
compensation
and
employers
liability
policies
of
these
individual
employers
will
not
cover
claims
arising 
from
work
on
the
joint
venture
projects.
A
separate
workers
compensation
policy
should
be
obtained
with 
the
joint
venture
named
as
the
employer.
When
such
a
policy
is
obtained,
the
insurer
will
add
a
joint 
venture
as
insured
endorsement
(WC
00
03
05)
to
the
policy.
The
endorsement’s
purpose
is
to
clarify
that 
the
coverage
afforded
by
the
policy
applies
to
the
members
of
the
joint
venture
but
only
with
respect
to 
work
associated
with
that
joint
venture. 
Alternate
Employer
Endorsement
Companies
that
lend
or
borrow
employees
will
usually
need
to
take
steps
to
make
sure
coverage
is
27provided
for
these
employees
while
they
are
working
under
such
an
arrangement.
The
“borrowed
servant 
doctrine”
holds
that
an
employer
(the
“special”
employer)
who
borrows
or
leases
an
employee
from 
another
firm
(the
“regular”
employer)
can
be
liable
for
workers
compensation
benefits
owed
to
an
injured 
worker
under
certain
circumstances.
Examples
of
situations
where
the
borrowed
servant
doctrine
may
be 
applicable
include
hiring
of
temporary
employees
from
“temp”
agencies;
renting
of
equipment,
aircraft, 
or
vehicles
with
operators,
pilots,
or
drivers;
bringing
an
employee
of
an
equipment
manufacturer
to
the 
site
to
train
the
contractor’s
employees
in
the
operation
or
maintenance
of
the
equipment;
or
a
joint 
venture
using
its
partner’s
employees. 
Whether
the
company
is
the
regular
(lending)
or
special
(borrowing)
employer,
it
should
ensure
that 
coverage
is
provided
for
such
employees.
Coverage
is
provided
by
attaching
an
alternate
employer 
endorsement
(WC
00
03
01
A)
to
the
regular
employer’s
policy.
This
endorsement
extends
coverage
to 
employees
injured
while
working
for
the
specified
alternate
employer
as
though
the
alternate
employer 
were
an
insured
under
the
policy.
The
endorsement
also
stipulates
that
the
insurer
will
not
ask
the 
alternate
employer’s
insurer
to
share
in
a
loss
covered
by
the
endorsement. 
Attachment
of
the
alternate
employer
endorsement
to
the
regular
employer’s
workers
compensation 
policy
eliminates
the
possibility
that
the
alternate
(special)
employer
might
be
held
accountable
for 
payment
of
workers
compensation
benefits
to
a
borrowed
or
leased
employee.
Payroll
of
employees 
provided
to
the
alternate
employer
will
be
included
in
the
regular
employer’s
premium
calculation. 
Accordingly,
the
alternate
employer
should
not
include
the
payroll
for
these
employees
in
its
payroll 
figures
provided
to
its
workers
compensation
insurer. 
Employee
Leasing
Endorsements
In
recent
years,
a
growing
number
of
employers
lease
their
“employees”
from
a
professional
employer 
organization
(PEO).
The
most
commonly
cited
benefits
of
this
arrangement
include
a
reduced 
administrative
burden
and
lower
costs
for
insurance
and
employee
benefits.
Particularly
for
small
and 
medium-sized
firms
(e.g.,
fewer
than
100
employees),
PEOs
can
often
provide
access
to
a
variety
of 
coverages
and
benefit
options
that
would
otherwise
be
unattainable.
Some
employers
lease
all
of
their 
employees;
others
lease
only
specific
categories
of
workers. 
Employee
leasing
situations
raise
questions
over
who
is
the
employer
for
purposes
of
complying
with
the 
workers
compensation
statute.
Some
states
have
positively
declared
one
party
or
both
parties
in
a
leasing 
arrangement
to
be
the
statutory
employer;
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
statute,
common
law
prevails.
In 
that
case,
the
“borrowed
servant”
doctrine
will
operate
just
as
it
does
when
employers
borrow
or
lend 
employees,
which
was
discussed
above.
In
a
nutshell,
the
borrowed
servant
doctrine
holds
the
special 
employer
responsible
for
providing
workers
compensation
benefits
for
leased
employees
under
the 
following
circumstances. 
•
An
express
or
implied
contract
of
hire
exists
between
the
special
employer
and
the
injured 
employee.
•
The
employee
is
engaged
primarily
in
work
for
the
special
employer.
•
The
special
employer
controls
the
details
of
the
work.
The
special
employer
almost
always
will
be
found
to
be
the
common
law
employer
based
on
these 
criteria.
However,
many
states
have
declared
that
the
special
employer
and
the
regular
employer
are 
coemployers
for
workers
compensation
purposes.
In
a
coemployment
relationship,
the
special
and
regular 
employers
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
workers
compensation
benefits,
and
the
exclusive
remedy 
protection
is
thereby
extended
to
both
parties. 
In
most
states,
coverage
arranged
in
residual
markets
must
be
insured
on
a
multiple
coordinated
policy 
basis
when
the
placement
is
made
by
the
leasing
company
instead
of
the
client.
What
this
means
is
that 
each
client
of
the
leasing
company
is
issued
a
policy
in
its
own
name
to
cover
the
employees
leased
by 
that
client.
Nonleased
employees
and
any
employees
leased
from
other
leasing
companies
are
excluded 
from
coverage
under
this
policy.
All
policies
issued
to
the
clients
of
the
same
leasing
company
are 
assigned
to
the
same
insurer,
who
will
arrange
the
policies
with
a
common
renewal
date
and
send
a
28master
invoice
to
the
leasing
company.
The
leasing
company
is
free
to
determine
how
it
will
pass
the
cost 
of
the
workers
compensation
coverage
through
to
the
clients. 
Unlike
the
residual
market,
many
states
allow
coverage
to
be
arranged
in
the
voluntary
market
in
any 
manner
the
insurer
and
insured
agree
upon,
as
long
as
the
arrangement
does
not
violate
any
other
state 
laws.
State
rules
regarding
the
arrangement
of
workers
compensation
coverage
for
leased
employees 
presumably
are
drafted
to
conform
to
that
state’s
workers
compensation
law.
Where
the
rules
are
silent
on 
the
matter,
contractors
should
take
steps
to
determine
whether
a
particular
arrangement
will
satisfy
their 
legal
obligations
under
their
states’
workers
compensation
statutes.
The
Industrial
Accident
Commission 
or
Workers
Compensation
Bureau
of
the
state
in
question
should
be
able
to
clarify
this
issue. 
Whether
the
special
employer
or
the
PEO
is
securing
the
coverage,
attaching
the
appropriate
combination 
of
endorsements
to
each
policy
is
crucial
to
executing
the
intent
of
the
parties.
The
general
strategy
is
for 
one
party
to
secure
coverage
for
the
leased
employees
and
add
the
other
party
as
an
alternate
employer; 
coverage
for
these
employees
is
simultaneously
excluded
under
the
alternate
employer’s
policy.
The
party 
that
is
named
as
an
alternate
employer
should
require
a
certificate
of
insurance
at
inception
of
the
lease 
and
each
renewal
thereafter
as
evidence
of
coverage. 
In
consideration
of
the
special
needs
of
firms
involved
in
long-term
employee
leasing
arrangements,
the 
NCCI
has
drafted
six
endorsements
that,
used
in
the
correct
combination,
protect
the
interests
of
both
the 
special
employer
and
the
PEO.
Exhibit
3.1
shows
the
proper
use
of
these
endorsements,
depending
on 
whether
the
special
employer
or
the
PEO
is
securing
the
coverage.
These
arrangements
assume
that
both 
parties
maintain
a
workers
compensation
insurance
policy
regardless
of
where
the
leased
employees
are 
covered.
In
most
circumstances,
this
is
a
prudent
risk
management
strategy,
and
where
the
special 
employer
also
has
nonleased
employees,
it
will
be
necessary. 
The
labor
contractor
endorsement
(WC
00
03
20
A)
is
a
form
of
“additional
insured
endorsement”
that, 
when
attached
to
the
special
employer’s
policy,
extends
coverage
to
the
PEO
for
any
liability
it
may
have 
arising
out
of
injuries
to
employees
leased
to
the
contractor.
Consistent
with
the
intention
of
the
parties,
it 
also
waives
the
special
employer’s
workers
compensation
insurer’s
right
of
subrogation
against
the
PEO. 
The
employee
leasing
client
endorsement
(WC
00
03
19)
and
the
labor
contractor
exclusion
endorsement 
(WC
00
03
21)
are
intended
as
substitutes.
That
is,
when
the
PEO
is
not
responsible
for
providing
the 
workers
compensation
coverage,
one
or
the
other,
but
not
both,
should
be
used
on
the
PEO’s
policy.
The 
employee
leasing
client
endorsement
excludes
coverage
for
leased
employees
and
reinforces
the
intent 
that
the
special
employer
provide
this
coverage.
However,
the
endorsement
does
provide
contingent 
coverage
for
the
PEO’s
liability
to
leased
employees
in
the
event
the
special
employer
fails
to
provide
the 
coverage.
The
labor
contractor
exclusion
endorsement,
however,
contains
an
absolute
exclusion
of 
coverage
for
these
employees.
Clearly,
the
employee
leasing
client
endorsement
is
the
preferred 
endorsement
since
it
fills
a
potential
gap
in
coverage,
generally
at
no
additional
cost
unless
the
coverage 
is
activated.

Note
:
These
rules
apply
in
most
states.
If
the
PEO
purchases
the
coverage,
the
alternate
employer
endorsement
(WC
00
03
01
A)
should
be 
attached
to
its
policy
to
extend
coverage
to
the
special
employer
for
any
liability
the
special
employer 
incurs
for
injuries
to
leased
employees,
whether
under
the
workers
compensation
law
or
under
common 
law.
This
is
a
form
of
additional
insured
endorsement
and
as
such
contains
a
waiver
of
the
insurer’s
right 
to
subrogate
against
the
special
employer.
Coverage
for
leased
employees
is
then
deleted
from
the
special 
employers
policy
by
attaching
the
employee
leasing
client
exclusion
endorsement
(WC
00
03
22),
which 
is
an
absolute
exclusion
of
coverage
for
liability
to
employees
leased
from
the
company
named
on
the 
endorsement.
Consequently,
it
is
imperative
that
the
special
employer
obtain
proof
that
the
leasing 
company
has
procured
the
appropriate
coverage
and
attached
the
alternate
employer
endorsement,
naming 
the
special
employer
as
an
alternate
employer.
To
this
end,
the
cancellation
provision
of
the
standard 
alternate
employer
endorsement
should
always
be
modified
to
require
that
the
alternate
employer
be 
notified
of
cancellation.
Absent
this
modification,
the
policy
can
be
canceled
without
notice
to
the 
contractor,
leaving
it
with
an
uninsured
exposure
and
(in
most
states)
in
violation
of
its
statutory 
obligation
to
secure
workers
compensation
coverage. 
Some
insurance
professionals
may
advise
against
the
use
of
the
employee
leasing
client
exclusion 
endorsement
on
the
grounds
that
it
could
leave
the
special
employer
without
coverage.
However,
unless 
this
exposure
is
excluded,
the
payrolls
of
the
leased
employees
will
be
included
in
the
special
employer’s 
premium
base.
Further,
if
both
policies
apply
to
a
given
claim,
the
policy
states
that
all
policies
providing 
coverage
will
share
the
loss
equally
until
the
loss
is
paid,
which
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
parties. 
Defense
Base
Act
Coverage
Endorsement
Congress
has
extended
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA)
benefits 
(discussed
in
Chapter
5)
to
civilian
employees
doing
work
for
the
federal
government
outside
the 
continental
United
States.
It
covers
not
only
the
employees
of
contractors
(including
foreign
nationals) 
doing
work
on
foreign
defense
bases
but
also
those
employees
engaged
in
foreign
public
works
projects. 
For
example,
much
of
the
work
contracted
by
the
U.S.
government
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
would
fall 
under
the
Defense
Base
Act.
Contractors
can
obtain
coverage
for
this
exposure
by
attaching
a
Defense 
Base
Act
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
01
01
A)
to
the
workers
compensation
policy.
Unless
an 
exposure
develops,
most
insurers
will
add
this
endorsement
without
an
additional
premium
charge.
30However,
if
an
exposure
does
exist,
the
cost
for
such
coverage
can
be
substantial. 
Waiver
of
Subrogation
Endorsement
Contractors
are
frequently
required
to
waive
rights
of
recovery
against
an
owner
or
upper-tier
contractor. 
When
a
waiver
of
subrogation,
as
this
is
called,
is
implemented,
it
prevents
the
contractor’s
workers 
compensation
insurer
from
bringing
an
action
against
the
other
party
(e.g.,
the
owner
or
other
contractor) 
alleging
that
the
other
party’s
negligence
contributed
to
the
injuries
sustained
by
the
contractor’s 
employee. 
To
avoid
disputes
with
insurers,
employers
should
always
attempt
to
have
a
waiver
of
subrogation 
endorsement
attached
to
their
workers
compensation
policies
when
they
enter
into
a
contract
that 
stipulates
that
a
subrogation
waiver
applies.
The
NCCI
waiver
of
our
right
to
recover
from
others 
endorsement
(WC
00
03
13)
may
be
used
for
this
purpose.
It
was
promulgated
to
specifically
deal
with 
waivers
of
subrogation
and
is
the
more
desirable
approach
for
an
insured
to
use
in
obtaining
a
waiver
of 
subrogation
from
its
workers
compensation
insurer. 
The
endorsement
includes
a
schedule
in
which
the
parties
for
whom
the
subrogation
waiver
applies
are
to 
be
listed.
The
endorsement
can
be
used
on
a
case-by-case
basis
by
indicating
the
particular
organization 
for
whom
the
waiver
will
apply
on
the
schedule,
or
it
can
apply
on
a
blanket
basis
by
indicating
in
the 
schedule
that
it
applies,
for
example,
to
“any
party
with
whom
the
insured
agrees
to
waive
subrogation
in 
a
written
contract.” 
A
premium
charge
is
generally
made
for
a
waiver
of
subrogation.
When
it
applies
on
a
blanket
basis,
the 
charge
may
be
as
much
as
2
percent
of
the
total
policy
premium.
When
the
waiver
is
to
apply
to
a
single 
contract,
the
charge
is
usually
2
to
5
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
premium
attributable
to
the
project
to 
which
it
applies. 
The
use
of
an
endorsement
instead
of
relying
solely
on
a
waiver
of
subrogation
in
the
contract
eliminates 
the
possibility
of
future
misunderstandings
as
to
whether
a
waiver
of
subrogation
in
connection
with
a 
particular
contract,
or
on
a
blanket
basis,
was
intended.
Compliance
with
the
underwriting
guidelines,
as 
far
as
the
waiver
endorsement
is
concerned,
is
particularly
advisable
in
light
of
the
importance
of
workers 
compensation
subrogation
in
any
state’s
statutory
compensation
scheme. 
Designated
Workplaces
Exclusion
Endorsement
The
designated
workplaces
exclusion
endorsement
(WC
00
03
02)
excludes
from
coverage
injuries 
incurred
at
workplaces
described
in
the
endorsement.
It
is
often
used
when
the
insured
is
a
contractor
who 
is
working
on
a
large
construction
project
subject
to
a
wrap-up
plan,
a
single
consolidated
insurance
plan 
covering
all
parties
to
a
construction
contract.
It
may
also
be
used
when
the
employer
has
more
than
one 
workers
compensation
policy
to
exclude
workplaces
covered
under
the
other
policy. 
Terrorism
and
Catastrophic
Loss
Endorsements
The
Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Program
Reauthorization
Act
of
2015
(TRIPRA
of
2015)
was
signed
into 
law
on
January
15,
2015.
The
Act
extends
the
provisions
of
the
Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Act 
(TRIA)/Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Program
Reauthorization
Act
of
2007
(TRIPRA
of
2007)
until 
December
31,
2020,
subject
to
some
modifications
related
to
the
federal
share
of
compensation
due
and 
the
insurer
aggregate
trigger.
The
extension
of
TRIA
was
crucial
to
workers
compensation.
Unlike
most 
other
lines
of
insurance,
workers
compensation
insurers
may
not
exclude
coverage
for
terrorism
in
any 
jurisdiction
except
Pennsylvania,
which
allows
an
exclusion
for
specific
war-related
activities. 
In
response
to
the
passage
of
the
Reauthorization
Act
of
2015,
NCCI
has
issued
two
revised 
endorsements,
the
Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Program
Reauthorization
Act
disclosure
endorsement
(WC 
00
04
22
B)
and
the
catastrophe
(other
than
certified
acts
of
terrorism)
premium
endorsement
(WC
00
04 
21
D)
for
attachment
to
workers
compensation
policies
issued
or
in
force
on
or
after
January
1,
2015,
in 
jurisdictions
that
have
approved
the
endorsements
for
use. 
The
Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Program
Reauthorization
Act
Disclosure
Endorsement
was
designed
to
31identify
and
describe
the
requirements
along
with
the
premium
charge
attributable
to
TRIPRA
of
2015. 
The
Act,
effective
through
December
31,
2020,
continues
to
provide
insurers
a
backstop
for
catastrophic 
losses
similar
to
the
ones
resulting
from
the
events
of
September
11,
2001.
This
endorsement
is
very
close 
in
wording
to
prior
endorsements
relating
to
federal
terrorism
legislation
incorporating
the
amendments 
contained
in
the
language
of
TRIPRA
of
2015. 
The
endorsement
contains
a
paragraph
that
states
the
policy
provides
coverage
for
losses
resulting
from 
“acts
of
terrorism,”
meaning
those
that
have
been
certified
by
the
U.S.
Secretary
of
the
Treasury.
The 
wording,
however,
notes
that
coverage
for
this
type
of
loss
is
dependent
on
all
policy
terms,
definitions, 
conditions,
and
exclusions,
as
well
as
on
any
federal
and
state
laws,
rules,
and
regulations
that
may
be 
applicable.
This
is
an
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
policyholder
understands
that
a
loss
caused
by
“an
act
of 
terrorism”
is
not
automatically
covered
if
other
policy
language
or
governmental
statutes
and/or 
regulations
would
preclude
it. 
The
intent
of
the
catastrophe
(other
than
certified
acts
of
terrorism)
premium
endorsement
when
originally 
issued
in
2005
was
to
allow
insurers
to
surcharge
policyholders
for
catastrophic
exposures
that
were
not 
contemplated
in
the
regular
state
workers
compensation
rate-making
process.
With
the
development
of
a 
separate
endorsement
(and
rate)
to
address
foreign
terrorism
(foreign
terrorism
premium
endorsement
WC 
00
04
22),
this
endorsement
was
revised
effective
January
1,
2006,
to
charge
the
policyholder
for
the 
coverage
of
losses
resulting
from
earthquakes,
catastrophic
industrial
accidents,
and
“certain
acts
of 
domestic
terrorism”
(essentially
those
that
fell
outside
the
scope
of
TRIA
or
that
were
afforded
coverage 
by
the
foreign
terrorism
premium
endorsement). 
The
version
of
the
endorsement
that
was
effective
September
1,
2008,
reflected
the
changes
necessitated 
by
the
passage
of
TRIPRA
of
2007.
Since
TRIPRA
of
2007
provided
coverage
for
all
certified
acts
of 
terrorism
and
made
no
geographic
distinction
between
foreign
and
domestic
losses,
this
endorsement
was 
revised
to
afford
coverage
for
catastrophic
losses
including
noncertified
acts
of
terrorism
while
clearly 
stating
that
no
coverage
(or
premium
charge)
was
included
for
certified
acts
of
terrorism
backstopped
by 
TRIA
and
provided
coverage
by
the
Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Program
Reauthorization
Act
Disclosure 
Endorsement
(WC
00
04
22
B). 
The
current
endorsement,
effective
January
1,
2015,
is
unchanged
except
for
an
amendment
to
update
the 
reference
to
the
Terrorism
Risk
Insurance
Program
Reauthorization
Act
Disclosure
Endorsement
(WC
00 
04
22
B)
contained
in
the
form. 
Broad
Form
Named
Insured
Endorsement
Some
energy
companies
have
many
subsidiaries
and
sister
companies.
Forgetting
to
name
even
one
of 
these
companies
as
an
insured
could
lead
to
uninsured
workers
compensation
or
employers
liability 
claims.
To
reduce
the
possibility
of
this
occurring,
it
is
fairly
common
to
attach
a
broad
form
named 
insured
endorsement.
A
broad
form
named
insured
endorsement
provides
automatic
coverage
to
a
host
of 
related
entities.
For
example,
the
endorsement
might
cause
the
policy
to
automatically
cover
all 
subsidiary,
affiliated,
associated,
controlled,
or
allied
companies,
corporations,
or
firms
for
which
the 
company
has
responsibility
for
placing
insurance.
Of
course,
underwriters
must
be
cautious
about
using 
this
endorsement
to
assure
that
they
are
aware
of
all
the
risks
they
are
covering
under
the
policy
and
are 
properly
charging
for
them.
There
is
no
standard
NCCI
endorsement
of
this
type,
but
most
commercial 
insurers
have
one
or
more
of
their
own
that
can
be
used. 
Modified
Notice
of
Injury
Endorsement
The
workers
compensation
policy
states
that
the
insured
must
notify
the
insurer
at
once
if
an
injury
occurs 
that
might
be
covered
under
the
policy.
While
the
policy
does
not
explain
exactly
what
constitutes 
reporting
“at
once,”
it
is
certainly
demanding
fast
action.
The
insurer
is
simply
trying
to
secure
the
ability 
to
quickly
investigate
the
accident
and
take
actions
to
mitigate
the
loss.
While
the
consequences
of
the 
insured’s
failure
to
give
timely
notice
of
the
injury
to
the
insurer
are
not
spelled
out
in
the
policy,
it
could 
void
coverage;
this
is
especially
true
if
the
insurer
can
show
that
it
was
prejudiced
by
the
late
notice. 
Since
the
provision
requires
the
insured
to
report
all
injuries
that
may
be
covered,
the
best
approach
is
to
32report
all
employee
injuries,
making
no
judgments
about
whether
a
given
injury
is
covered.
It
is
also 
important
to
understand
that
this
duty
to
report
employee
injuries
to
the
insurer
is
separate
and
distinct 
from
any
injury
reporting
requirement
imposed
by
a
state
workers
compensation
law
or
the
Occupational 
Safety
and
Health
Act
(OSHA). 
Since
the
employer
cannot
report
injuries
of
which
it
has
no
knowledge,
the
requirement
that
injuries
be 
reported
“at
once”
raises
the
question
of
when
the
employer
is
considered
to
have
knowledge
of
an
injury. 
For
example,
if
a
supervisor
is
aware
of
an
injury
or
potential
injury
but
fails
to
report
it
(perhaps
with
the 
employee’s
consent
to
avoid
losing
bonuses
based
on
safety
records)
until
it
becomes
evident
that
the 
employee
will
need
medical
treatment,
is
the
insured
guilty
of
breaching
its
notification
requirement?
To 
avoid
disputes
over
this
issue,
the
obligation
to
report
an
injury
is
sometimes
modified
to
begin
as
soon 
as,
but
not
before,
a
specified
individual
(such
as
a
manager
or
the
risk
manager)
is
informed
of
the
injury 
or
potential
injury.
There
is
no
standard
NCCI
endorsement
of
this
type,
but
most
commercial
insurers 
have
one
or
more
of
their
own
that
can
be
used. 
Extended
Notice
of
Cancellation
Endorsement
The
conditions
section
of
the
workers
compensation
policy
states
that
the
insurer
must
give
the
insured
10 
days’
written
notice
of
policy
cancellation.
(Many
states
require
longer
notice,
such
as
30
days.
In
that 
case,
the
policy
states
that
this
provision
is
altered
to
comply
with
the
state’s
notice
requirement.)
The 
states
vary
on
whether
or
not
advance
notice
is
required
if
the
insurer
decides
not
to
renew
the
policy
or 
intends
to
materially
alter
the
policy.
This
may
result
in
an
inadequate
amount
of
time
to
arrange
coverage 
with
another
insurer,
following
cancellation
or
nonrenewal.
An
extended
notice
of
cancellation 
endorsement
can
be
used
to
require
longer
notice
of
cancellation,
intent
not
to
renew,
or
material
change 
in
the
policy.
A
minimum
of
60
days’
notice
is
generally
needed
to
evaluate
other
insurance
options;
90 
days’
notice
is
even
better
for
the
insured.
There
is
no
standard
NCCI
endorsement
of
this
type,
but
most 
commercial
insurers
have
one
or
more
of
their
own
that
can
be
used.

The
Workers
Compensation
Marketplace
Chapter
Overview
and
Objectives
Employers
subject
to
workers
compensation
laws
secure
the
payment
of
benefits
to
injured
employees
in 
one
of
the
following
two
ways. 
•
By
purchasing
workers
compensation
insurance
•
By
obtaining
authorization
from
the
state
to
self-insure
Most
businesses
comply
with
the
law
by
purchasing
workers
compensation
insurance.
Individual 
self-insurance
is
allowed
in
nearly
all
states,
but
it
is
feasible
only
for
large
employers
that
have
the 
financial
resources
to
pay
the
mandated
benefits
directly
to
injured
employees—and
to
convince 
regulators
of
their
ability
to
do
so.
Group
self-insurance
gives
smaller
employers
an
alternative
to
workers 
compensation
insurance
in
states
where
it
is
allowed
but
also
subjects
these
businesses
to
a
certain
amount 
of
risk. 
On
completion
of
this
chapter
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
recognize
the
mechanics
of
the
workers
compensation
marketplace
2.
and
identify
the
options
open
to
a
given
employer
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
workers 
compensation
laws.
Workers
Compensation
Insurance
Markets
Depending
on
the
state(s),
workers
compensation
insurance
is
available
from
the
following
sources. 
•
A
monopolistic
state
fund
•
The
voluntary
private
market
•
A
competitive
state
fund
organization
•
A
state
residual
market
plan
Monopolistic
State
Funds
In
North
Dakota,
Ohio,
Washington,
and
Wyoming,
employers
are
required
to
purchase
workers 
compensation
coverage
through
a
state
workers
compensation
insurance
fund.
These
state
funds
are 
referred
to
as
monopolistic
state
funds
because
the
state
fund
is
the
only
workers
compensation
insurer
in 
these
states.
Puerto
Rico
and
the
U.S.
Virgin
Islands
also
have
monopolistic
state
funds.
Insurance 
companies
are
not
involved
in
the
workers
compensation
insurance
systems
in
these
jurisdictions.
Since 
the
monopolistic
state
fund
insures
all
employers
in
the
state
(except
those
employers
that
can
qualify
as 
self-insurers
in
the
three
monopolistic
state
fund
states
that
allow
self-insurance),
there
are
no
separate 
residual
market
facilities
in
these
states. 
The
Voluntary
Private
Market
In
all
but
the
four
monopolistic
states,
businesses
can
purchase
workers
compensation
insurance
from 
insurance
companies
that
are
licensed
to
write
workers
compensation
insurance
in
the
state.
Virtually
all 
insurers
that
write
other
types
of
insurance
for
businesses
(commercial
property,
commercial
general
34liability,
and
commercial
auto
insurance,
for
example)
also
write
workers
compensation
insurance. 
However,
there
are
instances
when
the
insurance
company
that
writes
the
other
insurance
coverage 
needed
by
the
business
is
unwilling
to
provide
the
necessary
workers
compensation
coverage.
When
the 
business
in
question
presents
unusual
or
high-risk
loss
exposures
or
has
had
poor
workers
compensation 
loss
experience,
such
a
response
on
the
part
of
the
insurer
is
probably
to
be
expected. 
Competitive
State
Funds
In
the
19
states
shown
in
Exhibit
4.1,
employers
have
the
option
of
purchasing
workers
compensation 
insurance
from
a
competitive
state
fund
organization,
an
insurance
facility
established
and
(initially
at 
least)
funded
by
the
state
that
competes
with
insurance
companies
for
workers
compensation
business
in 
that
state
only.
These
competitive
state
fund
organizations
have
been
established
in
hopes
of
reducing
the 
premiums
businesses
pay
for
workers
compensation
insurance. 
Sometimes
the
competitive
state
fund
is
willing
and
able
to
provide
coverage
for
a
lower
premium
than 
the
voluntary
private
marketplace.
A
possible
drawback
to
purchasing
coverage
through
a
competitive 
state
fund
is
that
these
funds
are
often
unable
to
provide
full
coverage
for
an
employer’s
obligations
under 
other
states’
laws.

Residual
Market
Plans
Employers
that
are
unable
to
purchase
workers
compensation
insurance
in
the
voluntary
private
market 
can
purchase
it
from
the
state
residual
market
facility.
In
about
two-thirds
of
the
states
that
have 
competitive
state
fund
organizations,
the
competitive
state
fund
serves
as
the
state’s
residual
market 
facility.
In
these
states,
the
state
fund
must
offer
coverage
to
all
eligible
employers
who
apply,
and
there 
is
no
separate
residual
market
facility.
In
the
majority
of
the
remaining
jurisdictions,
the
residual
market 
facility
is
what
is
most
often
referred
to
as
a
state-assigned
risk
plan. 
Assigned
risk
plans
are
state-mandated
programs
in
which
all
insurers
that
write
workers
compensation 
insurance
in
the
state
must
participate.
The
exact
operation
of
these
plans
varies
somewhat
by
state. 
Alternatives
to
Insurance
Some
employers
can
comply
with
state
workers
compensation
insurance
requirements
by
obtaining 
authorization
to
self-insure,
either
as
an
individual
entity
or
as
part
of
a
self-insurance
group.
In
general, 
this
option
is
available
only
to
relatively
large
corporations—particularly
where
individual
self-insurance 
is
concerned.
However,
group
self-insurance
may
be
a
viable
option
for
smaller
employers
provided
they 
are
willing
and
able
to
accept
the
risk
of
assessments
to
cover
any
costs
in
excess
of
the
group’s 
reinsurance
coverage. 
Individual
Self-Insurance
Individual
workers
compensation
self-insurance
is
permitted
in
all
states
except
North
Dakota
and 
Wyoming,
provided
the
employer
meets
the
criteria
applicable
to
prospective
self-insurers.
In
general,
the 
statutes
require
that
the
employer
provide
regulators
with
satisfactory
proof
of
its
ability
to
directly
pay 
required
benefits
to
injured
workers. 
Some
states
only
allow
employers
whose
standard
workers
compensation
premium
is
above
a
specified 
dollar
amount
to
qualify
as
self-insurers.
In
most
states,
self-insurers
must
file
securities
with
regulators 
as
a
guarantee
of
their
ability
to
meet
their
obligations.
To
limit
their
liability
to
a
specified
amount,
many 
states
also
require
self-insurers
to
purchase
excess
insurance
or
reinsurance. 
Group
Self-Insurance
Group
self-insurance
(where
individual
employers
combine
to
insure
the
workers
compensation 
exposures
of
all
of
group
members)
is
currently
allowed
in
the
39
states
listed
in
Exhibit
4.2.
Eligibility 
requirements
vary
from
state
to
state.
Some
states
require
groups
to
have
a
total
standard
workers 
compensation
premium
of
a
specified
amount.
Many
also
require
group
members
to
be
in
the
same
or
a 
related
industry.
All
require
prospective
self-insurance
groups
to
submit
a
plan
of
operation
to
regulators 
for
approval.
In
addition,
groups
can
only
operate
in
a
single
state
and
can
only
insure
workers 
compensation
exposures. 
Although
workers
compensation
self-insurance
groups
make
the
advantages
of
self-insurance
available
to
36smaller
businesses,
there
are
disadvantages
as
well.
One
disadvantage
is
that
it
subjects
members
to
the 
risk
of
assessments
for
amounts
not
covered
by
the
group’s
reinsurance.

Federal
Workers
Compensation
Laws
for 
Maritime
Chapter
Overview
and
Objectives
There
are
several
federal
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
laws
that
require
employers
to 
provide
compensation
to
their
injured
workers.
Unendorsed,
the
2015
National
Council
on
Compensation 
Insurance
(NCCI)
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
does
not
provide
coverage
for 
liability
imposed
by
federal
law.
Thus,
endorsements
are
required
to
provide
coverage
for
liability 
imposed
by
a
federal
workers
compensation
or
employers
liability
law
under
a
standard
workers 
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy. 
This
chapter
examines
the
federal
workers
compensation
laws
of
special
importance
to
the
energy 
industry
and
explains
how
insurance
coverage
for
the
resulting
exposures
may
apply.
These
laws
are 
listed
in
Exhibit
5.1.

Federal
Workers
Compensation
Laws
1.
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA)
—Provides
no-fault 
workers
compensation
benefits
to
employees
other
than
seamen
(i.e.,
masters
or
crew 
members
of
a
vessel)
injured
in
maritime
employment—generally,
in
loading,
unloading, 
repairing,
or
building
a
vessel.
2.
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act
(OCSLA)
—Provides
a
compensation
remedy
to 
workers
who
are
injured
or
killed
while
engaged
in
mineral
exploration
or
development
on 
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
or
on
fixed
structures
(such
as
oil
and
gas
production
platforms) 
erected
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf.
It
does
so
by
making
the
Longshore
Act
applicable 
to
nonseaman
employees
working
in
exploration,
development,
and
extraction
of
natural 
resources
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf.
These
workers
rarely
qualify
as
seamen
because 
they
are
employed
on
nonvessel
fixed
structures,
which
are
considered
islands
subject
to 
shore-based
principles
or
law
rather
than
on
vessels.
There
is
another
federal
workers
compensation
law
that
pertains
to
the
energy
industry
that
will 
not
be
discussed
in
this
chapter
because
it
is
self-insured
by
the
U.S.
government
and
applies
only
to 
employees
and
former
employees
of
the
Department
of
Energy
and
its
contractors
and
U.S.
contractors. 
The
Energy
Employees
Occupational
Illness
Compensation
Program
(EEOICP)
Act
p
rovides 
compensation
and
the
payment
of
medical
expenses
to
employees
and
former
employees
of
the
Energy 
Department,
its
contractors
and
subcontractors,
or
to
their
survivors
in
certain
instances
when
the 
individual
is
deemed
eligible
under
the
Act.
The
thrust
of
the
Act
is
to
compensate
those
workers
who 
have
become
ill
as
a
result
of
being
exposed
to
radiation,
beryllium,
or
silica
or,
in
some
cases,
uranium, 
while
working
in
nuclear
weapon
production. 
The
federal
employers
liability
laws
will
be
discussed
in
Chapter
6. 
On
completion
of
this
chapter
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
recognize
the
workers
compensation
exposures
many
energy
companies
face
because
of
the 
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act,
Defense
Base
Act,
and
the
Outer
Continental 
Shelf
Lands
Act;
2.
identify
ways
of
insuring
the
exposures
created
because
of
the
foregoing
acts;
and
3.
recognize
the
scope
of
coverage
provided
by
the
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation 
Act
coverage
endorsement
to
an
energy
company’s
workers
compensation
policy.
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA) 
Including
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act
(OCSLA)
The
LHWCA
provides
a
no-fault
compensation
remedy,
in
lieu
of
the
common
law
remedy
of
damages, 
to
employees
other
than
members
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel
(they
qualify
as
“seamen”)
who
are
injured
or 
suffer
an
occupational
disease
while
engaged
in
maritime
employment
on
navigable
waters.
1
It
preempts 
state
workers
compensation
and
provides
substantially
higher
federal
benefits. 
The
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act
(OCSLA)
2
provides
a
compensation
remedy
to
workers
who
are 
injured
or
killed
while
engaged
in
mineral
exploration
or
development
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
or 
on
fixed
structures
(such
as
oil
and
gas
production
platforms)
erected
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf.
It 
does
so
by
making
the
Longshore
Act
applicable
to
nonseaman
employees
working
in
exploration, 
development,
and
extraction
of
natural
resources
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf.
These
workers
rarely 
qualify
as
seamen
because
they
are
employed
on
nonvessel
fixed
structures,
which
are
considered
islands 
subject
to
shore-based
principles
or
law
rather
than
on
vessels. 
History
of
LHWCA
Employees
working
on
or
near
navigable
waters
who
are
not
seamen
are
outside
the
scope
of
state 
compensation
laws.
Therefore,
in
1927
the
LHWCA
was
passed
to
provide
uniform
coverage
for
all
40work-related
injury,
disability,
and
death
of
employees
(other
than
master
and
members
of
the
crew) 
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
United
States
(also
applicable
to
dry
docks
if
recovery
is
not 
provided
under
state
law). 
Litigation
involving
the
federal
Act
has
focused
primarily
on
coverage,
in
an
attempt
to
delineate
the 
boundaries
between
federal
and
state
jurisdictions
over
workers
injured
on
or
near
navigable
waters. 
Coverage
has
steadily
expanded
under
judicial
interpretation
since
the
original
enactment.
This
expansion 
received
further
impetus
in
1972
when
the
LHWCA
was
first
amended
to
provide
coverage
to
certain 
shore-based
workers.
In
1984
the
Act
was
amended
again,
in
part
to
check
the
steady
trend
of
expanding 
coverage.
The
1984
amendments
also
changed
the
title
of
the
federal
compensation
Act
to
the
“Longshore 
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act.” 
The
latest
amendments
in
2009
related
to
work
on
recreational
vessels.
Prior
to
2009,
workers
who 
repaired
or
dismantled
recreational
vessels
fewer
than
65
feet
in
length
were
excluded
from
LHWCA 
coverage
if
a
state
workers
compensation
program
covered
them.
These
rules
became
effective
January 
30,
2012. 
History
of
OCSLA
With
the
advent
of
offshore
oil
exploration
off
the
coast
of
the
United
States,
a
contest
for
dominion
and 
control
of
the
subsoil
and
mineral
resources
beneath
the
coastal
waters
of
the
United
States
surfaced 
between
the
U.S.
government
and
several
of
the
states.
The
U.S.
Congress
resolved
this
controversy
by 
passing
the
Submerged
Lands
Act
and
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act. 
The
Submerged
Lands
Act
confirmed
to
the
states
the
ownership
of
the
lands
and
natural
resources 
beneath
the
navigable
waters
within
3
nautical
miles
off
their
respective
coastlines.
Specific
exceptions 
were
made
for
Texas
and
Florida,
whose
territorial
seaward
boundaries
at
the
time
of
their
admission
into 
the
United
States
had
been
10
nautical
miles.
The
authority
of
the
states
to
apply
their
laws
to
fixed 
platforms
located
within
their
territorial
seaward
boundaries
was
left
intact. 
The
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act
(OCSLA)
made
the
laws
and
jurisdiction
of
the
United
States 
applicable
to
the
subsoil
and
seabed
of
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
and
to
all
artificial
islands
and
fixed 
structures
erected
on
the
shelf
to
explore
for
natural
resources. 
Covered
Employees
As
amended,
the
LHWCA
currently
applies
to
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
including 
any
longshoreman
or
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations.
It
also
applies
to
any
harbor 
worker,
including
a
ship
repairman,
shipbuilder,
or
shipbreaker,
whose
employer
is
engaged
in
maritime 
activity,
in
whole
or
in
part,
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
United
States
(including
any
adjoining
pier, 
wharf,
dry
dock,
terminal,
building
way,
marine
railway,
or
adjoining
area
customarily
used
by
such 
employer
in
loading,
unloading,
repairing,
dismantling,
or
building
a
vessel). 
The
U.S.
Supreme
Court
has
decided
that
the
“maritime
employment”
requirement
is
met
if
the
injured 
worker
establishes
that
the
injury
occurred
on
actual
navigable
waters.
If
so,
the
worker
need
not
prove 
that
the
employment
possessed
a
direct
or
substantial
relation
to
navigation
or
commerce. 
Waters
are
“navigable”
when
they
are
used
or
are
susceptible
to
being
used
in
their
ordinary
condition
as 
highways
for
commerce.
“Navigable
waters
of
the
United
States”
include
those
that
form
in
their
ordinary 
condition
by
themselves,
or
by
uniting
with
other
waters,
a
continuous
highway
over
which
commerce
is 
or
may
be
carried
on
with
other
states
or
foreign
countries.
Most
waters
are
navigable
for
Longshore
Act 
purposes
because
the
location
of
a
work
activity
on
or
near
water
is
usually
due
to
the
commercial
benefit 
of
the
waterway.
Consequently,
the
navigability
of
waterways
is
seldom
an
issue
on
which
coverage 
hinges. 
The
Act
does
not
apply
to
a
master
or
member
of
a
crew
of
any
vessel
(who
qualifies
as
a
“seaman”)
or
to 
any
person
hired
by
the
master
to
load,
unload,
or
repair
any
vessel
under
18
tons,
or
to
any
officers
or 
employees
of
the
United
States
or
foreign
governments.
Nor
does
the
Act
apply
to
the
following 
employees,
provided
they
are
covered
under
a
state
workers
compensation
law. 
41•
Office
clerical,
secretarial,
security,
or
data
processing
workers
•
Employees
of
a
club,
camp,
recreational
operation,
restaurant,
museum,
or
retail
outlet
•
Marina
employees
who
are
not
engaged
in
construction,
replacement,
or
expansion
of
the
marina, 
except
for
routine
maintenance
•
Individuals
employed
by
suppliers,
transporters,
or
vendors,
temporarily
doing
business
on
the 
premises
of
an
employer
and
not
engaged
in
work
normally
performed
by
employees
of
that 
employer
•
Aquaculture
workers
•
Individuals
employed
to
build,
repair,
or
dismantle
recreational
vessels
of
any
length
A
final
class
of
workers
excluded
consists
of
employees
of
facilities
that
are
certified
as
exclusively 
engaging
in
the
business
of
building,
repairing,
or
dismantling
small
vessels.
“Small
vessels”
are
defined 
as
commercial
barges
under
900
lightship
displacement
tons
or
commercial
tugboats,
towboats,
crew 
boats,
supply
boats,
fishing
vessels,
or
other
work
vessels
under
1,600
tons
gross.
However,
these
workers 
are
not
excluded
from
coverage
under
the
Act
if
any
of
the
following
apply. 
•
The
injury
occurs
upon
navigable
waters
or
on
any
adjoining
pier,
wharf,
dock,
facility
over
land 
for
launching
vessels,
or
facility
over
land
for
hauling,
lifting,
or
dry-docking
vessels.
•
The
facilities
receive
federal
maritime
subsidies.
•
The
employee
is
not
covered
by
a
state
workers
compensation
law.
In
addition,
OCSLA
makes
the
Longshore
Act
applicable
to
any
nonseaman
employee
who
is
employed 
in
operations
conducted
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
for,
developing, 
removing,
or
transporting
by
pipeline
natural
resources.
The
Act
does
not
apply
to
nonseamen
working
on 
fixed
platforms
within
state
territorial
boundaries
unless
they
are
engaged
in
traditional
maritime 
employment,
such
as
the
loading
and
unloading
of
vessels.
The
Act
has
also
been
applied
to
workers 
injured
on
waters
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
United
States. 
In
January
2012,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
considered
whether
OCSLA
requires
the
injury
to
actually 
occur
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
to
be
covered
by
the
Longshore
Act.
The
Court
determined
it
does 
not.
Rather,
the
Court
adopted
a
test
that
requires
that
an
injured
worker
establish
a
“substantial
nexus” 
between
the
injury
and
the
covered
extraction
operations
on
the
shelf.
This
ruling
expanded
the 
jurisdiction
of
OCSLA.
Employers
engaged
in
covered
activities
now
have
shoreside
OCSLA
exposure 
that
did
not
exist
prior
to
this
ruling.
The
Supreme
Court
offered
little
guidance
on
the
meaning
of 
“substantial
nexus,”
instead
leaving
this
to
the
administrative
law
judges
and
courts. 
Key
Applicability
Issues
The
1972
legislation
provided
for
a
two-tiered
status
and
situs
test
as
a
prerequisite
to
obtaining
the 
favorable
Longshore
Act
benefits.
Longshore
Act
“situs”
requires
that
the
accident
occur
“upon
the 
navigable
waters
of
the
United
States
(including
any
adjoining
pier,
wharf,
dry
dock,
terminal,
building 
way,
marine
railway,
or
other
adjoining
area
that
is
customarily
used
by
an
employer
in
loading, 
unloading,
repairing,
dismantling,
or
building
a
vessel).”
Activities
upon
navigable
waters
of
the
United 
States
are
unquestionably
within
Longshore
Act
situs.
In
addition,
courts
have
been
quite
liberal
in 
interpreting
“adjoining
area
customarily
used”
to
include
areas
that
are
sometimes,
but
not
exclusively, 
used
for
loading,
unloading,
repairing,
dismantling,
or
building
a
vessel.
“Adjoining”
does
not
necessarily 
mean
“contiguous
to”
or
“bordering.”
All
that
is
required
is
that
the
area
be
close
to
or
in
the
vicinity
of 
navigable
waters. 
For
example,
it
has
been
held
that
rooms
used
for
the
storage
and
maintenance
of
longshoremen’s
gear 
located
five
blocks
from
the
gate
of
the
nearest
dock
were
within
Longshore
Act
situs.
Other
examples 
include
buildings
ranging
from
1,000
to
2,000
feet
from
the
nearest
navigable
waters
and
a
maintenance 
and
storage
building
located
1
mile
from
the
main
harbor
terminal. 
42This
expansive
view
and
liberal
interpretation
of
the
courts
can
be
explained,
in
part,
by
the
fact
that 
Congress
sought
to
eliminate
the
situation
in
which
a
potential
claimant
under
the
Act
would
be
traveling 
in
and
out
of
Longshore
Act
jurisdiction
during
the
regular
performance
of
employment
duties.
For 
example,
a
shipyard
worker
might
be
covered
while
on
the
vessel
being
constructed
but
not
when
in
the 
warehouse
housing
his
or
her
tools
located
away
from
the
vessel. 
“Status”
under
the
Act
requires
that
the
worker
be
engaged
in
“maritime
employment,
including
any 
longshoreman
or
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations,
and
any
harbor
worker
including
a
ship 
repairman,
shipbuilder,
and
shipbreaker.”
Status
also
refers
to
employers,
but
the
Act’s
definition
of 
“maritime
employer”
is
not
very
revealing.
It
states,
“The
term
‘employer’
means
an
employer
any
of 
whose
employees
are
employed
in
maritime
employment,
in
whole
or
in
part....”
Unfortunately,
this
broad 
definition
leaves
a
lot
of
room
for
interpretation
and
an
employer
may
not
realize
that
he
or
she
employs 
“maritime
employees”
and
is,
therefore,
a
“maritime
employer”
until
after
an
incident
occurs. 
The
key
to
understanding
Longshore
Act
status
is
a
clear
understanding
of
“maritime
employment.” 
However,
since
this
phrase
was
coined
by
Congress
in
1972,
no
trustworthy
definition
has
been
found. 
The
courts
appear
content
to
rule
on
particular
classes
of
individuals
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
However, 
some
practical
observations
can
be
made
regarding
the
types
of
workers
who
may
fall
within
the
Act’s 
jurisdiction. 
•
Employees
expressly
delineated
in
the
Act
as
maritime
employees,
such
as
longshoremen,
ship 
repairmen,
shipbuilders,
shipbreakers,
and
harbor
workers,
will
normally
be
granted
Longshore 
Act
coverage
since
they
customarily
perform
their
job
activities
on
or
near
navigable
waters.
•
Many
workers
whose
employment
is
not
ordinarily
associated
with
maritime
matters,
such
as 
carpenters,
truck
drivers,
crane
operators,
computer
operators,
welders,
and
laborers,
are
potential 
maritime
employees
when
performing
these
duties
near
navigable
waters
or
shipping
facilities, 
especially
if
they
are
regularly
and
routinely
assigned
to
that
area.
In
other
words,
the
nearer
and 
more
often
an
employee
frequents
a
shoreside
area,
the
more
likely
he
or
she
is
to
be
granted 
Longshore
Act
status.
•
Although
some
lower
court
decisions
contain
language
to
the
effect
that
workers
who,
through 
transience
or
mere
fortuity,
are
injured
upon
actual
navigable
waters
will
not
gain
status,
if
an 
injured
employee
ends
up
wet
or
is
injured
upon
a
floating
structure,
it
should
be
anticipated
that 
Longshore
Act
benefits
are
due.
The
Supreme
Court
has
expressly
reserved
the
issue
of
whether 
the
LHWCA
applies
to
a
worker
injured
while
“transiently
or
fortuitously”
upon
navigable
waters, 
although
it
noted
in
passing
a
“substantial
difference
between
a
worker
performing
a
set
of
tasks 
requiring
the
worker
to
be
both
on
and
off
navigable
waters,
and
a
worker
whose
job
is
entirely 
land-based
but
who
takes
a
boat
to
work.”
Clearly,
the
issue
is
highly
fact-specific
and
subject
to
varied
interpretation.
In
contrasting
examples,
a 
lower
court
affirmed
that
a
worker
who
spent
40
percent
of
his
work
time
on
shore,
30
percent
on
fixed 
platforms,
and
30
percent
on
oil
exploration
and
production
vessels
was
engaged
in
maritime
employment 
because
he
was
injured
while
on
actual
navigable
waters,
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
Yet,
the
same 
court
found
no
coverage
under
the
LHWCA
for
a
mechanic
performing
all
of
his
work
duties
on 
navigable
waters
because
he
was
simply
transported
to
and
from
his
workstation—a
stationary 
platform—by
boat. 
Interconnection
between
LHWCA
and
State
Workers
Compensation
Systems
For
certain
types
of
workers,
the
1984
amendments
provide
coverage
only
if
no
state
system
does. 
However,
there
still
remain
numerous
types
of
workers
engaged
in
amphibious
operations
who
have
the 
choice
of
pursuing
either
state
or
federal
compensation
remedies,
depending
upon
the
relevant
state 
statutes.
Longshore
benefits
that
are
not
“scheduled
injuries”
can
offer
benefits
for
life,
making
them 
more
attractive
to
an
injured
worker.
Additionally,
the
maximum
weekly
benefits
of
state
compensation 
systems
are
less
than
those
of
the
Act.
Therefore,
if
given
the
choice,
most
injured
workers
will
attempt
to 
place
themselves
under
the
LHWCA
over
a
state
system.
But
jurisdiction
is
concurrent. 
43With
little
room
for
exception,
workers
injured
on
actual
navigable
waters
can
successfully
claim
under 
the
LHWCA.
If
the
employment
can
be
deemed
“maritime
but
local,”
these
same
claimants
may
opt
for 
state
compensation
rights.
In
support
of
reciprocity,
state
compensation
systems
generally
extend 
coverage
to
land-based
workers
who
are
also,
by
their
status
as
maritime
employees,
entitled
to
LHWCA 
benefits. 
Workers
injured
on
fixed
platforms
who
are
exploring
for,
developing,
removing,
or
transporting 
resources
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
are
entitled
to
LHWCA
remedies
by
incorporation
through 
OCSLA,
as
discussed
earlier.
OCSLA
provides
LHWCA
remedies
to
these
workers
regardless
of
their 
status
or
situs.
In
addition,
these
workers
may
have
a
choice
under
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state
to
pursue 
rights
under
the
state
compensation
system.
Compensation
jurisdiction
(state
and
federal)
on
fixed 
platforms
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
or
shore
areas
adjoining
navigable
waters
is,
therefore, 
concurrent
rather
than
exclusive. 
Considerable
overlap
and
possible
conflicts
exist
between
the
workers
compensation
acts
and
the 
Longshore
Act.
Not
only
have
the
state
workers
compensation
acts
been
applied
to
workers
on
fixed 
platforms
in
state
territorial
waters,
but
the
LHWCA
has
also
provided
coverage
to
these
same
workers 
who
satisfy
the
situs
and
status
tests.
Similarly,
although
the
LHWCA
has
traditionally
been
applied
as 
the
exclusive
remedy
for
a
nonseaman
injured
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf,
some
states
(Louisiana,
for 
example)
have
extended
the
state
workers
compensation
act
to
workers
injured
on
fixed
platforms
on
the 
Outer
Continental
Shelf.
Employers
of
maritime
workers
must,
therefore,
insure
both
under
the
LHWCA 
and
the
state
workers
compensation
acts
to
fully
protect
themselves
against
ever-increasing
liabilities
in 
this
uncertain
area
of
the
law. 
Covered
Injuries
and
Diseases
The
LHWCA
covers
any
accidental
death
or
injury
occurring
within
the
course
and
scope
of
employment 
within
the
jurisdictions
to
which
the
law
applies.
Injuries
caused
by
the
willful
act
of
a
third
person 
directed
against
an
employee
because
of
his
or
her
employment
are
also
covered,
as
are
such
occupational 
diseases
or
infections
as
arise
naturally
out
of
such
employment
or
as
the
natural
or
unavoidable
results
of 
such
accidental
injury. 
Injury
or
death
occasioned
solely
by
the
intoxication
of
the
employee
or
by
the
willful
intention
of
the 
employee
to
injure
or
kill
himself
or
herself
or
another
is
not
compensable. 
Benefits
Benefits
under
LHWCA
include
the
following. 
•
Medical
services
and
supplies
•
Disability
(permanent
total,
temporary
total,
permanent
partial,
and
temporary
partial)
•
Death
benefits
Payment
for
medical
services
and
supplies
is
required
for
such
period
as
the
nature
of
the
injury
or
the 
process
of
recovery
may
require. 
Disability
benefits
are
paid
according
to
(1)
whether
the
injury
is
partial
or
total
and
(2)
whether
the
injury 
is
scheduled
or
nonscheduled. 
Total
disability
benefits
are
recoverable
if
the
claimant
shows
that
he
or
she
is
physically
unable
to
do
the 
type
of
work
that
he
or
she
was
formerly
doing.
An
employer
who
wishes
to
counter
such
an
allegation 
must
do
so
by
establishing
that
actual
jobs
are
available
to
the
claimant. 
Total
disability
can
be
either
temporary
or
permanent.
Temporary
total
disability
occurs,
for
example, 
during
a
recovery
period
from
a
surgery
during
which
time
the
employee
is
unable
to
return
to
work 
temporarily
but
is
expected
to
return
to
some
level
of
work
following
recovery.
Permanent
total
disability 
occurs
when
even
after
recovery
and
reaching
maximum
medical
improvement,
the
injured
employee 
remains
unable
to
return
to
any
type
of
work. 
44Compensation
benefits
for
total
disability
are
66
2/3
percent
of
the
employee’s
average
weekly
wage.
For 
cases
of
partial
disability,
the
employee
is
entitled
to
66
2/3
percent
of
the
difference
between
the 
employee’s
average
weekly
wages
and
wage-earning
capacity
thereafter.
The
maximum
benefit
an 
employee
would
be
entitled
to
is
200
percent
of
the
national
average
weekly
wage.
The
minimum
benefit 
payable
for
total
disability
is
50
percent
of
the
national
average
weekly
wage. 
Once
an
injured
employee
reaches
maximum
medical
improvement,
he
or
she
can
return
to
work
if
the 
injury
was
temporary.
But
if
the
injury
resulted
in
either
partial
or
total
permanent
disability,
the 
employee
is
entitled
to
additional
payments.
If
the
disability
was
scheduled
(i.e.,
loss
of
an
eye,
disability 
to
the
leg,
or
loss
of
digits
to
a
hand),
the
total
unpaid
portion
of
the
award
is
paid
based
on
a
schedule 
found
in
the
Act
and
weekly
disability
payments
are
made
based
on
the
number
of
weeks
specified
on
the 
schedule.
If
the
injury
was
unscheduled,
the
benefits
are
paid
for
life
based
on
the
loss
of
earning 
capacity. 
Under
the
1984
amendments
to
the
Act,
death
benefits
are
not
payable
to
the
employee’s
beneficiaries
if 
the
death
was
not
caused
by
a
covered
injury.
If,
however,
the
employee’s
death
is
caused
by
a
covered 
injury,
death
benefits
will
be
paid
to
the
beneficiaries
as
follows. 
•
Funeral
expenses
not
exceeding
$3,000
•
50
percent
of
the
employee’s
average
weekly
wage
to
the
surviving
spouse
•
An
additional
16
2/3
percent
if
the
decedent
leaves
children
If
the
surviving
spouse
remarries,
a
lump
sum
payment
equal
to
2
years’
compensation
is
made
and
the 
benefits
cease.
Also,
if
the
surviving
spouse
remarries
or
dies,
the
percentages
of
the
average
weekly 
wage
available
to
the
other
surviving
dependents
change.
A
different
arrangement
of
percentages
exists 
for
children,
dependent
grandchildren,
parents,
and
collaterals
under
various
other
circumstances.
The 
total
percentages
payable,
however,
do
not
exceed
66
2/3
percent
of
the
average
weekly
wage.
The 
maximum
weekly
death
benefits
payable
are
also
limited
to
200
percent
of
the
national
weekly
wage,
not 
to
exceed
the
actual
weekly
wage
of
the
deceased. 
Provision
is
also
made
for
payment
of
benefits
when
the
employee
suffers
a
second
injury
increasing
his 
or
her
disability.
In
this
instance,
the
Second
Injury
Fund
may
assist
the
employer
in
paying
the
disability 
portion
of
benefits,
while
the
employer
remains
responsible
for
medical
payments.
Additionally, 
provision
is
made
for
compensation
to
employees
during
the
time
that
they
are
undergoing
vocational 
rehabilitation. 
LHWCA
Claims
The
following
individuals
can
bring
a
claim
under
the
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation 
Act. 
•
An
injured
employee
•
The
employee’s
surviving
dependent
spouse
•
Surviving
children
of
the
employee,
as
follows:
any
child
under
18
years
of
age,
any
wholly 
dependent
disabled
child
over
18,
and
any
child
under
23
who
is
a
full-time
student
at
a
recognized 
school
and
who
has
not
yet
completed
4
years
of
education
beyond
the
high
school
level
•
Dependent
parents
of
the
employee
The
claim
can
be
brought
against
the
immediate
employer
or
a
borrowing
employer.
In
the
event
that
the 
immediate
employer
defaults
on
its
obligation
to
secure
compensation,
benefits
are
recoverable
from
the 
general
contractor
of
the
employer
and
its
compensation
insurer. 
The
U.S.
Department
of
Labor
has
the
authority
to
govern
the
disposition
of
claims
arising
under
the 
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act.
Claims
are
administered
by
deputy
commissioners 
appointed
for
the
various
compensation
districts,
and
controverted
claims
are
adjudicated
by
federal 
administrative
law
judges.
Appeals
from
administrative
law
judge
decisions
are
reviewed
by
the
Benefits
45Review
Board
and
finally
by
the
federal
court
of
appeals
having
jurisdiction
over
the
compensation 
district
involved.
Review
by
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
may
also
be
available. 
Time
Limitations
on
Filing
Claims
A
claim
must
be
filed
within
1
year
after
the
injury
or
death.
In
the
instance
of
occupational
disease 
causing
delayed
death
or
disability,
the
claim
must
be
filed
within
2
years
after
the
employee
or
claimant 
becomes
aware,
or
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence
or
by
reason
of
medical
advice
should
have 
been
aware,
of
the
relationship
between
the
employment,
the
disease,
and
the
death
or
disability.
If 
payment
of
compensation
has
been
made
without
an
award
on
account
of
such
injury
or
death,
a
claim 
may
be
filed
within
1
year
after
the
date
of
the
last
payment. 
The
time
for
filing
a
claim
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
employee
or
beneficiary
is
aware,
or
by
the 
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence
should
have
been
aware,
of
the
relationship
between
the
injury
or
death 
and
the
employment.
In
some
instances,
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
report
a
known
accident
extends 
the
time
for
filing
of
the
claim. 
Claims
Settlement
Procedures
There
are
procedures
for
administrative
approval
of
proposed
settlement
agreements
in
the
Act
and
its 
accompanying
regulations.
Approval
of
such
settlements
is
discretionary
with
the
deputy
commissioner 
and
may
include
compensation
benefits,
death
benefits,
and
future
medical
expenses.
Settlements
may 
also
be
approved
after
entry
of
a
final
compensation
order.
Such
settlement
proposal
must
be
submitted
to 
the
deputy
commissioner
or
the
administrative
law
judge,
who
will
approve
it
within
30
days,
unless
it
is 
found
to
be
inadequate
or
procured
by
duress.
If
the
parties
are
represented
by
counsel,
settlements 
submitted
to
the
deputy
commissioner
will
be
deemed
approved
unless
specifically
disapproved
within
30 
days
of
submission
of
the
settlement.
A
claim
cannot
be
otherwise
withdrawn
without
the
approval
of
the 
deputy
commissioner
or
the
administrative
law
judge. 
Insurance
Requirements
and
Penalties
The
Act
stipulates
that
employers
who
are
subject
to
the
Act
must
secure
payment
of
benefits,
either
by 
purchasing
insurance
or
by
obtaining
authorization
from
the
U.S.
Secretary
of
Labor
to
self-insure.
An 
employer
who
fails
to
secure
compensation
is
subject
to
both
a
civil
action
for
damages,
in
which
it
may 
not
plead
the
defenses
of
contributory
negligence
or
assumption
of
the
risk,
and
a
criminal
misdemeanor 
charge,
for
which
its
corporate
officers
are
severally
liable.
Finally,
the
officers
are
jointly
liable
for
any 
benefits
under
the
Act
that
the
corporation
has
failed
to
secure. 
Medicare
Set-Asides
and
Secondary
Payer
Act
Settlements
under
the
LHWCA
are
subject
to
Medicare
set-aside
requirements.
The
reach
of
the 
Medicare,
Medicaid,
and
SCHIP
Extension
Act
of
2007
is
too
extensive
for
a
full
discussion
here; 
however,
following
are
a
few
key
points
of
which
to
be
aware. 
•
The
minimum
criteria
needed
for
a
Longshore
claim
to
require
review
by
a
Center
for
Medicare 
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
are
(1)
the
claimant
is
currently
eligible
for
Medicare
and
the
total 
value
of
the
settlement
exceeds
$25,000,
or
(2)
the
claimant
is
reasonably
expected
to
become 
eligible
for
Medicare
within
30
months
of
a
settlement
and
the
value
of
the
settlement
is
$250,000 
or
more.
(The
“value”
of
a
settlement
includes
past
and
future
medical
costs,
indemnity,
attorneys’ 
fees
and
costs,
and
Medicare
overpayments.)
•
Insurers
and
self-insured
entities
are
required
to
report
claims
made
by
Medicare-eligible
claimants 
to
CMS.
Nonreporting
can
result
in
significant
penalties.
However,
there
may
be
clarifications
of 
this
requirement
and
its
application
in
years
to
come.
•
Risk
managers
should
be
aware
that
settlements
with
a
claimant
who
is
or
can
soon
be 
Medicare-eligible
will
have
some
potential
difficulties
and
delays
with
set-asides
and
reporting 
requirements.
A
settlement
can
be
approved
subject
to
the
set-aside
being
funded
only
after
CMS 
approval
of
the
set-aside,
but
this
will
delay
final
resolution.
46Suits
Against
Third
Parties
under
the
Longshore
Act
Under
Section
905(b)
of
the
Act,
employees
entitled
to
compensation
can
also
sue
third
parties
for 
damage
caused
by
their
fault
or
negligence.
Such
third
parties
include
vessels
on
which
the
employees 
may
be
working;
however,
the
vessel
does
not
owe
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
such
employees. 
If
the
injured
person
was
employed
to
provide
shipbuilding,
repairing,
or
breaking
services,
and
the 
person’s
employer
was
also
the
owner
or
charterer
of
the
vessel,
no
third-party
action
is
permitted
against 
the
employer
in
its
capacity
as
the
vessel’s
owner
or
charterer. 
The
standard
of
care
in
a
negligence
action
has
been
redefined
by
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court.
The
standard 
was
defined
in
terms
of
the
stevedore-vessel
owner’s
relationship
during
cargo
operations.
At
the
present 
time,
it
appears
that
a
duty
is
imposed
on
the
vessel
owner
to,
at
least,
warn
the
stevedore
of
any 
dangerous
condition
existing
at
the
outset
of
the
stevedoring
operations
of
which
the
vessel
owner
should 
have
been
aware
through
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care. 
Contracts
of
indemnity
whereby
the
vessel
seeks
indemnity
from
the
employer
are
unenforceable
unless 
the
injured
employee
was
receiving
benefits
under
the
Act
by
virtue
of
Section
4
of
OSCLA.
In
that 
event,
the
vessel
may
enforce
any
reciprocal
indemnity
obligation
whereby
the
employer
and
the
vessel 
agree
to
defend
and
indemnify
the
other
for
injury
to
or
death
of
their
respective
employees. 
If
a
third
party
is
responsible
for
the
injury,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
recover
the
amount
of 
compensation
paid.
Acceptance
of
compensation
payments
by
the
claimant
creates
a
lien
against
the 
funds
recovered
by
the
claimant
from
third
parties. 
Settlement
between
the
employee
and
third
parties
without
the
written
approval
of
the
employer 
terminates
the
employer’s
obligation
for
future
compensation
benefits.
The
U.S.
Supreme
Court
has
held 
that
this
provision
of
the
Act
is
absolute.
Settlement
with
written
approval
of
the
employer
reduces
the 
employer’s
future
compensation
obligation
by
the
net
proceeds
received
by
the
claimant
in
the
settlement. 
Suits
Against
Third
Parties
under
OCSLA
Under
OCSLA,
the
exclusive
remedy
of
covered
fixed
platform
workers
or
their
survivors
against 
employers
is
the
statutory
compensation
benefits
provided
by
the
Longshore
Act.
However,
injured 
workers
(and
any
other
persons
designated
by
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state)
may
bring
an
action
against 
third
parties
for
deaths
or
injuries
that
occur
on
fixed
platforms
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf.
The
claim 
can
be
brought
against
any
nonemploying
person,
corporation,
and/or
vessel
committing
the
tort. 
Due
to
the
absence
of
a
federal
common
law
of
the
United
States,
a
personal
injury
or
wrongful
death 
action
involving
events
occurring
on
fixed
platforms
located
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
is
governed 
by
federal
law,
and
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state
is
applied
as
surrogate
federal
law.
It
was
originally 
thought
that
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
United
States
would
be
applied
to
fixed
platforms
erected
on 
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
and
producing
natural
resources.
However,
it
is 
now
well
settled
that
these
platforms
are
to
be
considered
artificial
islands
that
are
not
governed
by 
maritime
law. 
Tort
actions
brought
by
workers
on
fixed
platforms
located
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
may
be 
brought
in
federal
court,
under
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act
or
diversity
of
citizenship 
jurisdiction,
or
in
state
court.
In
either
case,
trial
by
jury
is
permitted.
Tort
actions
brought
by
workers
on

located
within
the
state’s
territorial

boundaries
may

court
or 
in
federal
court
under
diversity
of

jurisdiction.
In
either
case,

is
permitted. 
How
To
Insure
LHWCA
Exposures
Because
standard
workers
compensation
policies
do
not
automatically
provide
coverage,
LHWCA 
exposure
requires
specific
treatment.
Coverage
can
be
provided
by
adding
a
Longshore
and
Harbor 
Workers’
Compensation
Act
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
01
06
A)
to
a
standard
workers 
compensation
policy,
by
purchasing
stand-alone
coverage
from
a
federally
authorized
insurer,
or
by 
becoming
an
approved
self-insurer. 
47How
To
Insure
OCSLA
Exposures
Because
standard
workers
compensation
policies
do
not
automatically
provide
coverage,
OCSLA 
exposure
requires
specific
treatment.
Coverage
can
be
provided
by
adding
an
Outer
Continental
Shelf 
Lands
Act
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00

C)
to
a
standard
workers
compensation
policy. 
LHWCA
Coverage
Endorsement
The
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
01
06
A)
adds 
coverage
for
benefits
owed
under
the
LHWCA.
The
LHWCA
provides
medical,
disability
income,
and 
survivorship
benefits
to
eligible
employees
injured
in
maritime
employment
on
the
navigable
waters
of 
the
United
States
and
adjoining
areas.
Eligible
employees
generally
include
those
involved
in
loading
and 
unloading
vessels
and
building,
repairing,
or
dismantling
vessels.
Masters
and
crew
members
of
a
vessel 
are
not
covered
by
the
Longshore
Act. 
The
endorsement
amends
the
definition
of
workers
compensation
law
to
include
the
Longshore
and 
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
and
any
amendments
to
the
Act
in
effect
during
the
policy
period. 
The
endorsement
also
includes
exclusionary
language
eliminating
coverage
for
all
other
federal
workers 
compensation
laws
and
specifically
stipulates
that
no
coverage
is
provided
for
benefits
owed
under
the 
Nonappropriated
Fund
Instrumentalities
Act,
the
Defense
Base
Act,
or
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands 
Act.
All
three
of
these
federal
laws
extend
the
LHWCA
to
apply
to
additional
types
of
employees
not 
otherwise
eligible
for
benefits
under
the
LHWCA.
If
coverage
for
liability
imposed
by
any
other
federal 
workers
compensation
law
is
needed,
it
must
be
specifically
added
to
the
policy
using
the
appropriate 
federal
coverage
endorsement. 
The
endorsement
also
makes
exclusion
8
to
the
employers
liability
portion
of
the
policy
inapplicable
to 
work
that
is
subject
to
the
LHWCA.
Exclusion
8
to
the
employers
liability
section
of
the
policy
eliminates 
employers
liability
coverage
for
bodily
injury
to
those
engaged
in
work
that
is
subject
to
a
number
of 
specified
federal
workers
compensation
acts,
including
the
LHWCA.
Here
again,
if
coverage
for
liability 
imposed
by
any
of
these
other
federal
laws
is
needed,
it
must
be
specifically
added
to
the
policy
using
the 
appropriate
federal
coverage
endorsement. 
The
nature
of
an
organization’s
business
and
its
territorial
scope,
particularly
in
relation
to
operations
at 
or
about
navigable
waters,
will
impact
how
coverage
is
provided
and
the
cost. 
Known
Exposure
When
an
organization
has
a
known
exposure,
it
either
must
purchase
insurance,
self-insure,
or
maintain
a 
combination
of
the
two;
that
is,
retain
a
certain
amount
and
add
specific
excess
or
aggregate
excess
where 
permissible.
Because
the
conditions
under
which
the
LHWCA
operates
are
not
well
defined,
private 
insurers
are
often
reluctant
to
offer
coverage
and
other
options
such
as
specialty
insurers,
state
funds, 
assigned
risk
plans,
and
voluntary
pools
may
need
to
be
considered. 
Exposures
must
be
carefully
and
completely
described
to
underwriters
to
ensure
that
proper
coverage
is 
purchased. 
No
Known
Exposure
Even
a
company
that
has
no
known
exposures
to
the
Act
should
still
request
that
an
LHWCA 
endorsement
be
attached
to
its
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy.
Then
if
an
injured 
worker
is
found
to
be
covered
under
the
LHWCA,
the
employer
will
have
insurance
coverage
and
will 
avoid
possible
fines
and/or
jail
terms.
Many
insurers
are
willing
to
attach
this
endorsement
on
an
“if
any” 
basis
and
for
no
charge
or
a
minimal
charge.
If
an
exposure
arises
during
the
policy
period,
it
will
be 
discovered
during
the
annual
premium
audit,
and
an
additional
premium
will
be
charged
based
on
the 
appropriate
classification
and
rate.
Some
insurers
may
decline
to
add
the
endorsement. 
Premium
Rates
Rates
are
promulgated
by
the
various
workers
compensation
rating
authorities.
There
are
specific 
classifications
(such
as
shipbuilding,
ship
repair,
and
stevedoring)
that
are
defined
as
federal
48classifications
and
are
designated
by
an
“F”
code
after
the
four-digit
classification
number.
For
nonfederal 
classifications,
work
is
classified
in
accordance
with
the
workers
compensation
code
applicable
in
the 
state
of
operations,
and
the
state
rate
is
modified
by
a
percentage
surcharge
to
obtain
the
LHWCA
rate. 
Supplemental
coverages,
such
as
required
under
the
Defense
Base
Act
and
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf 
Lands
Act,
are
rated
differently
by
each
insurer
and
generally
are
not
subject
to
approval
by
a
rating 
authority. 
Self-Insurance
Requirements
Employers
that
wish
to
self-insure
the
exposure
must
first
obtain
permission
from
the
U.S.
Department
of 
Labor’s
Office
of
Workers’
Compensation
Programs.
An
employer
can
apply
to
be
authorized
to 
self-insure
provided
it
can
show
that
it
has
the
following. 
1.
Financial
resources
to
meet
all
obligations
under
the
Act
2.
Adequate
excess
insurance
3.
Adequate
arrangements
for
prompt
authorization
of
and
payment
for
all
necessary
medical
care
4.
Made
a
security
deposit
as
prescribed
by
the
Office
of
Workers’
Compensation
Programs
5.
Agreed
to
carry
out
all
requirements
of
the
Act
The
authorization
to
self-insure
is
reviewed
annually. 
Penalties
for
Failure
To
Provide
Coverage
If
an
employer
fails
to
obtain
LHWCA
coverage,
an
injured
worker
or
survivors
may
elect
compensation 
under
the
Act
or
may
file
an
action
in
civil
court
or
under
general
maritime
law.
If
such
an
action
is
filed, 
the
employer
cannot
use
the
defenses
of
negligence
of
a
coemployee,
assumption
of
risk,
or
contributory 
negligence. 
If
an
employer
does
not
secure
payment
of
compensation,
the
employer
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
and
is 
subject
to
a
fine
of
up
to
$10,000,
1
year
in
prison,
or
both.
If
the
employer
is
a
corporation,
the
president, 
secretary,
and
treasurer
are
severally
and
personally
liable
for
benefits
and
compensation
due
an 
employee
under
the
law.

endorsement
(WC

adds
coverage
for
benefits
owed 
under
the
Outer
Continental

Lands
Act.
The
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act
extends
the
benefits 
established
in
the
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA)
to
those
employed
in 
operations
conducted
on
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
of
the
United
States
for
purposes
of
exploration, 
development,
or
removal
of
natural
resources
of
the
subsoil
and
seabed.
The
term
“outer
continental 
shelf”
is
very
precisely
defined
in
the
Act,
but
a
brief
working
definition
might
be
submerged
lands
lying 
seaward
of
the
boundaries
of
the
various
states
that
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
United
States. 
The
endorsement
amends
the
definition
of
workers
compensation
law
in
the
policy
to
include
the
Outer 
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act.
Notice,
however,
that
the
exclusionary
language
applying
to
all
other 
federal
workers
compensation
laws
remains.
If
coverage
is
needed
for
any
other
federal
workers 
compensation
law,
it
must
be
specifically
added
using
the
appropriate
endorsement. 
The
endorsement
also
makes
exclusion
8
to
the
employers

portion
of
the
policy
inapplicable
to 
work
that
is
subject
to

Act.
Exclusion

engaged
in
work 
that
is
subject
to
a
number
of
specified
federal
workers
compensation
acts,
including
the
Outer 
Continental
Shelf
Lands
Act.
Here
again,
if
coverage
for
liability
imposed
by
any
of
these
other
federal 
laws
is
needed,
it
must
be
specifically
added
to
the

Chapter
Overview
and
Objectives
The
federal
workers
compensation
laws
discussed
so
far
are
true
workers
compensation
laws,
in
that
they 
are
no-fault
laws
in
which
the
employee’s
right
to
sue
under
common
law
is
forfeited
in
exchange
for 
statutory
payments
for
injury
or
death
regardless
of
fault.
However,
there
are
other
federal
and
maritime 
laws
that
establish
a
cause
of
action
for
certain
employees
(or
their
survivors)
against
their
employer
in 
case
of
injury
or
death. 
50Exhibit
6.1
 
Federal
Employers
Liability
Laws
1.
General
Maritime
Law
—The
common
law
of
the
sea
holds
that
vessel
owners
owe 
“transportation,
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure”
to
masters
or
members
of
a
crew
of
a 
vessel
in
the
event
of
injury
or
illness
during
the
voyage,
regardless
of
whether
the
injury
or 
illness
is
work
related.
Also,
seamen
can
sue
the
vessel
owner
for
damages
resulting
from 
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
ship.
2.
Death
on
the
High
Seas
Act
—Establishes
a
cause
of
action
for
the
death
of
any
person 
(including
but
not
limited
to
an
employee
killed
on
the
job)
occurring
on
the
high
seas
more 
than
3
miles
from
the
U.S.
coast,
if
the
death
was
caused
by
the
unseaworthiness
of
a 
vessel
or
by
the
negligence
(or
strict
liability)
of
a
person
or
corporation.
3.
Merchant
Marine
Act
of
1920
(the
Jones
Act)
—Provides
seamen
with
a
negligence 
remedy
for
on-the-job
injury
without
having
to
overcome
employer
defenses
of
assumption 
of
the
risk
or
fellow
servant
liability.
Contributory
negligence
of
the
employee
does
not
bar 
recovery,
but
recovery
is
reduced
by
the
proportion
of
negligence
attributable
to
the 
employee.
As
explained
in
this
chapter,
the
availability
of
the
various
maritime
remedies
to
any
given
claimant 
depends
on
various
factual
issues,
such
as 
•
whether
the
claimant
is
a
seaman
or
a
longshoreman;
•
whether
the
equipment
involved
is
a
vessel
or
a
nonvessel;
•
whether
the
defendant
is
the
employer,
the
vessel
owner,
a
nonvessel
owner,
or
a
nonemployer 
third
party;
and
•
whether
the
accident
occurred
on
land,
on
a
vessel,
on
a
platform,
or
within
or
beyond
state 
territorial
waters.
Frequently,
a
single
injury
will
involve
multiple
remedies,
some
of
which
may
overlap
or
even
conflict. 
Awareness
of
the
interrelationship
of
these
remedies
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
optimal
resolution
of
the 
claim. 
On
completion
of
this
chapter
you
should
be
able
to 
1.
recognize
the
employers
liability
exposures
many
energy
companies
face
because
of
the
Jones
Act, 
the
Death
on
the
High
Seas
Act,
and
maritime
law;
2.
identify
the
factors
typically
considered
when
determining
seaman
status
and
vessel
in
navigation 
status;
and
3.
identify
ways
of
insuring
the
exposures
created
because
of
the
foregoing
acts.
Benefits
Available
to
Seamen
Maritime
law
affords
an
abundance
of
federal
remedies
to
workers
injured
while
engaged
in
maritime 
activities.
Employees
other
than
members
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel
who
are
injured
while
engaged
in 
maritime
employment
are
provided
with
a
single
no-fault
compensation
remedy,
in
lieu
of
the
common 
law
remedy
of
damages,
under
the
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA),
which 
is
discussed
in
Chapter
5.
Employees
qualifying
as
seamen,
however,
have
several
remedies
available
to 
them
in
the
event
of
an
employment-related
injury
or
disease.
These
remedies
can
be
divided
into
two 
groups,
statutory
remedies
and
general
maritime
law
remedies,
as
shown
in
Exhibit
6.2.

Statutory
Remedies
The
Jones
Act
is
perhaps
the
mostly
widely
recognized
maritime
remedy
under
American
law.
Unlike 
state
workers
compensation
statutes,
it
entitles
a
seaman
or
his
or
her
beneficiaries
to
sue
his
or
her 
employer
for
negligence
when
he
or
she
sustains
personal
injury
or
dies
in
the
course
of
his
or
her 
employment. 
The
Death
on
the
High
Seas
Act
establishes
a
cause
of
action
for
the
death
of
any
person
(including
but 
not
limited
to
an
employee
killed
on
the
job)
occurring
on
the
high
seas
more
than
3
miles
from
the
U.S. 
coast,
if
the
death
was
caused
by
the
unseaworthiness
of
a
vessel
or
by
the
negligence
(or
strict
liability) 
of
a
person
or
a
corporation. 
General
Maritime
Law
Remedies
In
addition
to
these
two
statutory
remedies,
seamen
may
also
be
entitled
to
damages
under
two
bases 
established
by
general
maritime
law. 
•
Unseaworthiness
•
Wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
It
has
long
been
recognized
under
general
maritime
law
that
the
vessel
owner
has
a
nondelegable
duty
to 
furnish
a
seaworthy
ship—one
that
is
reasonably
fit
for
its
intended
use.
Accordingly,
a
seaman
may 
pursue
a
claim
against
the
vessel
owner
for
damages
caused
by
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel.
This 
remedy
may
be
pursued
in
conjunction
with
the
seaman’s
Jones
Act
claim
even
if
the
vessel
owner
is
also 
the
employer. 
Similarly,
the
doctrine
of
maintenance
and
cure,
the
origin
of
which
is
rooted
in
the
ancient
sea
codes, 
grants
to
a
seaman
who
falls
ill
or
is
injured
while
in
the
service
of
the
vessel
the
right
to
food
and 
lodging
(maintenance)
and
medical
care
(cure).
This
right
begins
when
the
seaman
becomes
incapacitated 
and
continues
until
he
or
she
reaches
maximum
medical
recovery. 
The
discussion
that
follows
provides
an
overview
of
the
key
aspects
of
each
of
these
seamen’s
remedies 
but
focuses
particularly
on
the
requirements
that
must
be
met
for
the
seaman
to
have
a
valid
claim.
It
will 
also
indicate
defenses
to
the
claim
for
damages
that
may
be
available
to
the
employer. 
Jones
Act
3 
The
Jones
Act
was
enacted
in
1920
to
provide
a
remedy
for
injury
or
death
sustained
by
seamen
or 
members
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel
and
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
employer.
To
succeed
on
a
Jones 
Act
claim
against
his
or
her
employer,
a
seaman
must
show
that 
 
(1)
he
or
she
is
a
seaman
under
the
Act; 
 
(2)
he
or
she
suffered
an
injury
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
employment; 
 
(3)
his
or
her
employer
was
negligent;
and
52(4)
his
or
her
employer’s
negligence
caused
his
or
her
injury
at
least
in
part. 
Seaman
Status
Only
seamen
may
make
a
claim
under
the
Jones
Act.
The
worker
in
question
must
be
a
member
of
the 
vessel’s
crew
rather
than
a
land-based
employee
who
happens
to
be
working
on
the
vessel
at
a
given
time. 
To
qualify
as
a
Jones
Act
seaman,
an
individual
must
have
an
employment-related
connection
to
a
vessel 
or
identifiable
fleet
of
vessels
in
navigation
.
However,
the
federal
courts
and
juries
have
applied
liberal 
interpretations
of
the
term
“seaman”
to
the
extent
that
anyone
who
performs
a
significant
part
of
his
or
her 
work
aboard
a
vessel
on
navigable
waters
may
qualify
as
a
seaman,
even
such
unlikely
workers
as
a 
hairdresser,
musician,
bartender,
cook,
steward,
diver,
roustabout,
welder,
and
various
repairmen. 
To
further
clarify
which
workers
qualify
under
the
Act,
a
second
requirement
is
that
a
seaman
must
have 
a
connection
to
a
vessel
(or
identifiable
fleet)
in
navigation
that
is
substantial
in
terms
of
both
its
duration 
and
its
nature.
So
a
worker
who
spends
only
a
small
fraction
of
his
or
her
working
time
on
board
a
vessel 
is
fundamentally
land
based
and,
as
such,
is
not
a
member
of
the
vessel’s
crew,
regardless
of
his
or
her 
duties.
A
rule
of
thumb
is
that
a
worker
who
spends
less
than
about
30
percent
of
his
or
her
time
in
the 
service
of
a
vessel
in
navigation
should
not
qualify
as
a
seaman
under
the
Jones
Act. 
Vessel
in
Navigation
Status
Since
an
individual
must
have
an
employment-related
connection
to
a
vessel
or
identifiable
fleet
of 
vessels
in
navigation
to
qualify
as
a
Jones
Act
seaman,
it
is
crucial
to
determine
what
qualifies
as
a 
“vessel
in
navigation.”
The
term
“vessel”
has
been
broadly
defined
to
include
any
kind
of
watercraft
or 
equipment
capable
of
being
used
for
transportation
on
navigable
waters,
regardless
of
its
primary
purpose 
or
state
of
transit
at
a
particular
moment. 
Movable
drilling
rigs,
jack-up
barges,
drilling
barges,
and
similar
structures
are
deemed
to
be
“vessels.” 
However,
fixed
drilling
platforms
are
not
vessels.
Structures
such
as
spud
barges
and
work
pontoons
are 
considered
vessels
if
they
serve
a
significant
transportation
function
but
not
if
their
primary
purpose
is
to 
provide
a
floating
support
for
construction
or
other
activities.
4 
Other
Elements
of
the
Jones
Act
Claim
There
must
be
an
employer-employee
relationship
between
the
seaman
and
the
vessel
owner,
and
the 
accident
or
injury
must
occur
while
the
seaman
is
in
the
course
and
scope
of
that
employment. 
There
must
also
be
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer
or
its
employees
or
agents.
However,
the 
negligence
need
not
be
a
proximate
cause
of
the
injury
in
the
traditional
sense.
A
seaman
may
recover
if 
the
negligence
played
any
role,
even
the
slightest,
in
causing
the
injury
or
death. 
To
establish
negligence
by
the
employer,
a
Jones
Act
plaintiff
must
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the 
evidence
that
the
employer
breached
a
duty
to
protect
against
foreseeable
risks
of
harm.
An
employer’s 
duty
under
the
Jones
Act
is
to
provide
seamen
with
a
safe
place
to
work.
This
duty
extends
from
the 
vessel
to
the
shore,
provided
the
seaman
is
acting
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
employment.
Therefore,
the 
location
of
the
accident
does
not
control
whether
a
claim
can
be
made
under
the
Act.
It
can
cover 
accidents
on
land
if
the
other
requisites
are
met. 
Finally,
the
action
must
be
brought
by
the
injured
seaman.
Or,
if
the
seaman
has
died,
the
action
must
be 
brought
by
the
administrator/executor
of
the
seaman’s
estate
on
behalf
of
the
specified
beneficiaries. 
Specified
beneficiaries
are,
in
order
of
preference,
the
surviving
spouse
and
children,
and
if
none,
the 
seaman’s
parents,
and
if
none,
the
next
of
kin
dependent
on
the
seaman. 
The
action
for
negligence
under
the
Jones
Act
may
be
brought
only
against
the
seaman’s
employer.
It 
may
either
be
his
or
her
direct
(payroll)
employer,
a
borrowing
employer,
or,
in
some
instances,
both.
The 
employer
need
not
be
the
owner
of
the
vessel. 
Suit
may
be
brought
in
any
federal
or
state
court
within
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
employer
engages
in 
business
activity.
If
the
seaman
selects
the
state
forum,
the
defendant
may
not
remove
the
case
to
federal 
court.
53The
Jones
Act
gives
only
the
injured
seaman
or
his
or
her
personal
representative
the
right
to
elect
a
jury 
trial;
a
Jones
Act
defendant
does
not
have
that
option. 
All
Jones
Act
claims
must
be
filed
within
3
years
of
the
accident
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim. 
Defenses
to
the
Jones
Act
Claim
Comparative
negligence
is
a
partial
defense
to
a
Jones
Act
claim.
The
contributing
negligence
of
the 
seaman
does
not
bar
recovery
completely,
but
it
reduces
the
seaman’s
or
the
seaman’s
survivors’
recovery 
by
the
percentage
of
the
negligence
attributable
to
him
or
her. 
Another
defense
is
the
primary
duty
rule
.
The
primary
duty
rule
is
a
seldom-applied
rule
that
provides 
that
a
seaman
may
not
recover
from
his
or
her
employer
for
injuries
caused
by
his
or
her
own
failure
to 
perform
a
duty
imposed
on
him
or
her
by
his
or
her
employment.
This
defense
is
commonly
referred
to
as 
the
Walker-Reinhart
doctrine.
Although
the
application
of
the
defense
is
usually
avoided,
the
defense
may 
still
be
viable
where
the
employer
can
show
that
the
employee
(1)
was
injured
as
a
result
of
a
breach
of
a 
duty
that
the
employee
consciously
assumed
as
a
term
of
employment;
(2)
created
the
dangerous 
condition
or,
in
the
proper
exercise
of
employment
duties,
could
have
controlled
or
eliminated
the 
dangerous
condition;
and
(3)
knowingly
violated
the
duty
consciously
assumed
as
a
term
of
employment. 
The
common
law
doctrine
of
voluntary
assumption
of
a
known
risk
is
not
a
defense
under
the
Jones
Act. 
Jones
Act
Damages
When
a
seaman
is
injured,
he
or
she
is
entitled
to
recover
all
general
and
special
damages
attributable
to 
the
accident,
including
loss
of
past
and
future
wages
and
fringe
benefits,
impairment
of
future
earning 
capacity,
medical
expenses,
pain,
suffering,
disability,
and
humiliation
and
mental
anguish.
Loss
of 
consortium
or
society
is
not
allowed
to
the
spouse
or
children
of
an
injured
seaman
under
the
Jones
Act, 
and
punitive
damages
are
not
recoverable. 
In
wrongful
death
actions
under
the
Jones
Act,
recovery
is
limited
to
the
financial
loss
sustained
by
the 
specified
beneficiaries.
Recovery
may
include
the
following. 
•
Funeral
expenses.
•
Loss
of
support
—all
financial
contributions
the
decedent
would
have
made
to
his
or
her 
dependents
had
the
decedent
lived.
•
Loss
of
services
—the
monetary
value
of
services
the
decedent
provided
and
would
have
continued 
to
provide
but
for
his
or
her
wrongful
death.
Such
services
include
the
nurture,
training,
education, 
and
guidance
that
a
child
would
have
received
had
the
parent
not
been
wrongfully
killed.
Services 
the
decedent
performed
at
home
or
for
his
or
her
spouse
are
also
compensable.
•
Survivorship
claim
—seaman’s
lost
wages
during
the
period
from
the
time
of
injury
to
date
of 
death,
as
well
as
medical
expenses
and
pain
and
suffering
of
the
decedent
before
death.
Nonfinancial
losses
such
as
loss
of
love,
affection,
society,
care,
comfort,
and
companionship
are
not 
recoverable
in
a
Jones
Act
negligence
action. 
How
To
Insure
Jones
Act
Exposures
Unendorsed,
the
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
policy
does
not
provide
coverage
for 
bodily
injury
to
a
master
or
crew
member
of
any
vessel.
Employers
can
obtain
coverage
by
purchasing
a 
maritime
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
02
01
B)
to
a
standard
workers
compensation
policy.
The 
endorsement
is
discussed
later
in
the
chapter. 
Death
on
the
High
Seas
Act
The
high
seas
are
those
seas
beyond
3
nautical
miles
from
the
shore
of
any
state,
territory,
or
dependency 
of
the
United
States,
and
the
territorial
waters
of
a
foreign
nation.
The
Jones
Act
provides
a
remedy
for
54the
wrongful
death
of
a
seaman
who
is
killed
in
territorial
waters
(less
than
3
nautical
miles
from
the 
shore
of
any
state).
The
Death
on
the
High
Seas
Act
(DOHSA)
5
created
a
remedy
for
the
wrongful
deaths 
of
not
only
seamen
but
also
other
individuals,
occurring
more
than
3
nautical
miles
from
the
United
States 
and
its
territories
or
dependencies. 
The
DOHSA
remedy
is
not
limited
to
seamen,
nor
is
an
employment
relationship
a
prerequisite
to
this 
cause
of
action.
Further,
the
provisions
of
DOHSA
are
not
specifically
limited
to
persons
killed
on 
vessels.
Even
a
person
killed
in
an
aircraft
accident
on
the
high
seas
is
entitled
to
recover
under
DOHSA. 
Elements
of
the
DOHSA
Claim
A
claim
may
be
brought
under
DOHSA
for
a
death
caused
either
by
the
unseaworthiness
of
a
vessel
or 
the
negligence
or
strict
liability
of
a
person
or
corporation
or
by
both.
In
either
case,
the
elements
are
the 
death
of
a
seaman
or
other
person
on
the
high
seas
proximately
caused
by
a
wrongful
act,
neglect,
or 
default
that
involves
financial
loss
to
the
specified
beneficiaries. 
The
action
must
be
brought
by
the
administrator/executor
of
a
deceased
person’s
estate
for
the
benefit
of 
the
specified
beneficiaries,
which
include
the
decedent’s
spouse,
parents,
children,
and
dependent 
relatives.
The
claim
may
be
brought
against
any
vessel
in
rem
,
person,
or
corporation
responsible
for
the 
death
and
must
be
brought
in
federal
court,
and
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
The
suit
must
be
initiated 
within
3
years
from
the
date
of
the
wrongful
act,
neglect,
or
default. 
Defenses
to
the
DOHSA
Claim
Comparative
negligence
is
a
partial
defense
to
a
DOHSA
claim.
The
contributing
negligence
of
the 
seaman
does
not
bar
recovery
completely
but
it
reduces
the
survivors’
recovery
by
the
percentage
of
the 
negligence
attributable
to
him
or
her.
Assumption
of
the
risk
is
not
a
defense
under
DOHSA. 
DOHSA
Damages
Recovery
available
to
the
decedent’s
survivors
is
limited
to
the
financial
loss
sustained
by
them, 
proportioned
among
them
according
to
their
respective
loss.
This
includes
both
loss
of
support
and
loss
of 
services.
Loss
of
support
includes
all
financial
contributions
the
decedent
would
have
made
to
his
or
her 
dependents
had
he
or
she
lived.
Loss
of
services
encompasses
the
recovery
for
the
monetary
value
of 
services
the
decedent
provided
and
would
have
continued
to
provide
but
for
his
or
her
wrongful
death. 
Such
services
include
the
nurture,
training,
education,
and
guidance
that
a
child
would
have
received
had 
the
parent
not
been
wrongfully
killed.
Services
the
decedent
performed
at
home
or
for
his
or
her
spouse 
are
also
compensable. 
The
survivors
cannot
recover
for
loss
of
society,
consortium,
and
love
and
affection
of
the
decedent,
nor 
can
survivors
recover
for
lost
wages
during
the
period
from
the
time
of
injury
to
time
of
death,
medical 
expenses,
and
pain
and
suffering
of
the
decedent
prior
to
his
or
her
death. 
How
To
Insure
DOHSA
Exposures
Employers
can
obtain
coverage
by
purchasing
a
maritime
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
02
01
B)
to
a 
standard
workers
compensation
policy;
the
endorsement
is
discussed
later
in
this
chapter. 
Unseaworthiness
Liability
for
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
is
similar
to
strict
liability.
The
breach
of
the
warranty
of 
seaworthiness
gives
rise
to
a
claim
that
is
separate
from
a
claim
for
negligence
under
the
Jones
Act. 
The
owner
or
bareboat
charterer
of
a
vessel
has
an
absolute
and
continuing
duty
that
cannot
be
delegated 
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel.
The
warranty
of
seaworthiness
had
its
origin
in
the
ancient
maritime
codes 
and
court
decisions
and
is
based
on
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
United
States.
The
shipowner’s 
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
imposed
to
compensate
for
injuries
or
deaths
resulting
from
vessels
that
are 
not
reasonably
fit
for
their
intended
use. 
The
warranty
of
seaworthiness
extends
to
the
ship’s
hull,
gear,
stowage,
appurtenances,
passageways,
55cargo,
and
even
the
crew.
Examples
of
unseaworthy
conditions
include
defective
equipment,
lack
of 
proper
lifesaving
equipment,
absence
of
bathroom
facilities,
inadequate
lighting,
improper
stowage, 
unsafe
means
of
boarding
and
departing
a
vessel,
and
unsafe
or
improper
tools. 
Elements
of
the
Unseaworthiness
Claim
A
seaworthy
vessel
is
one
that
is
reasonably
fit
for
its
intended
use.
The
warranty
applies
to
a
seaman.
To 
achieve
seaman
status,
(1)
an
employee’s
duties
must
contribute
to
the
function
of
the
vessel
in
navigation 
or
to
the
accomplishment
of
its
mission,
and
(2)
a
seaman
must
have
a
connection
with
a
vessel
in 
navigation
(or
to
an
identifiable
group
of
such
vessels)
that
is
substantial
in
terms
of
both
its
duration
and 
its
nature. 
The
injury
must
occur
on
a
vessel
in
navigation.
The
determination
of
vessel
status
is
the
same
as
that
in 
Jones
Act
cases.
As
noted
earlier,
movable
drilling
rigs,
jack-up
barges,
drilling
barges,
and
similar 
structures
are
considered
vessels
with
respect
to
the
Jones
Act.
The
unseaworthy
condition
must
be
a 
proximate
cause
of
the
accident.
If
a
death
claim
is
involved,
the
accident
must
have
occurred
within
3 
nautical
miles
of
the
United
States
or
its
territories
or
dependencies. 
The
action
must
be
brought
by
the
injured
seaman.
An
injured
Jones
Act
seaman’s
spouse
and
children 
cannot
recover
for
loss
of
society
or
consortium
through
an
unseaworthiness
claim.
Based
on
the
1972 
amendments
to
the
LHWCA,
longshoremen
and
other
personnel
covered
by
that
Act
do
not
have
the
right 
to
bring
a
claim
for
unseaworthiness. 
Where
the
accident
has
resulted
in
death,
the
action
must
be
brought
by
the
administrator/executor
of
the 
estate
on
behalf
of
certain
beneficiaries.
While
the
classification
of
these
beneficiaries
is
not
definitively 
specified,
it
is
generally
suggested
that
the
beneficiaries
must
be
financially
dependent
upon
the
deceased 
seaman. 
An
unseaworthiness
claim
may
be
brought
against
the
vessel
in
rem
and
its
owner
and
bareboat
charterer 
in
personam.
Suit
may
be
brought
in
any
federal
or
state
court
within
the
jurisdiction
where
the
owner
or 
bareboat
charterer
engages
in
business
activity.
However,
an
in
rem
claim
against
a
vessel
for 
unseaworthiness
may
be
brought
only
in
federal
court.
Regardless,
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
in 
federal
court
unless
the
unseaworthiness
claim
is
coupled
with
a
Jones
Act
claim
or
brought
under
the 
court’s
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction. 
A
general
maritime
lawsuit
for
unseaworthiness
must
be
filed
within
3
years
from
the
date
that
death
or 
injury
occurs. 
Defenses
to
the
Unseaworthiness
Action
Comparative
negligence
is
a
partial
defense
to
a
general
maritime
law
action
for
unseaworthiness.
The 
contributory
negligence
of
the
injured
or
deceased
party
reduces
recovery
to
that
party
or
that
party’s 
survivors
by
the
percentage
of
the
negligence
attributable
to
the
injured
or
deceased,
but
it
does
not
bar 
recovery
completely. 
The
primary
duty
rule
also
serves
as
a
defense
with
respect
to
unseaworthiness
claims.
The
defense
here 
is
the
same
as
in
Jones
Act
cases. 
Operational
negligence
also
may
serve
as
a
defense
to
an
unseaworthiness
claim.
The
fact
that
someone 
acts
negligently
or
misuses
vessel
equipment
and
causes
an
injury
does
not
mean
that
the
vessel
itself
is 
unseaworthy.
An
accident
resulting
from
operational
negligence
that
does
not
create
a
permanent
or 
temporary
condition
is
not
a
basis
for
action
as
a
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness. 
However,
temporary
conditions
on
a
vessel
can
make
the
vessel
unseaworthy.
Since
liability
is
imposed 
without
regard
to
fault,
neither
lack
of
knowledge
nor
lack
of
control
over
the
condition
is
a
defense. 
Similarly,
the
common
law
doctrine
of
voluntary
assumption
of
a
known
risk
is
not
a
defense
under
the 
general
maritime
law. 
Unseaworthiness
Damages
The
damages
recoverable
in
an
unseaworthiness
action
are
the
same
as
those
recoverable
under
the
Jones
56Act.
However,
there
can
be
no
double
recovery. 
How
To
Insure
Seaworthiness
Exposures
Employers
can
obtain
coverage
by
purchasing
a
maritime
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
02
01
B)
to
a 
standard
workers
compensation
policy. 
Wages,
Maintenance,
and
Cure
A
seaman’s
right
to
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
is
implicit
in
the
contractual
relationship
between
the 
seaman
and
the
seaman’s
employer.
The
right
is
designed
to
insure
recovery
by
a
seaman
who
is
injured 
or
falls
ill
in
the
service
of
the
vessel,
regardless
of
fault,
and
is
intended
to
compensate
the
seaman
for 
wages
until
the
end
of
the
voyage
(wages),
the
value
of
the
seaman’s
room
and
board
while
aboard
the 
vessel
(maintenance),
and
necessary
medical
expenses
(cure). 
Wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
is
sometimes
compared
to
workers
compensation,
but
the
only
similarities 
are
that
both
are
based
on
the
employment
relationship
and
both
are
owed
whether
or
not
the
employer 
was
at
fault.
In
some
respects,
the
shipowner’s
liability
is
more
extensive
than
liability
under
any
workers 
compensation
act
because
a
seaman
need
only
be
accountable
to
the
call
of
duty
rather
than
actively 
engaged
in
the
performance
of
shipboard
duties
at
the
time
the
illness
or
injury
occurs. 
In
addition,
while
workers
compensation
affords
a
remedy
to
land-based
workers
against
their
employers 
in
place
of
a
tort
action,
the
right
to
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
is
not
the
seaman’s
exclusive
remedy 
against
his
or
her
employer.
A
seaman
may
also
recover
damages
for
negligence
under
the
Jones
Act
and 
for
breach
of
the
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel. 
Elements
of
the
Wages,
Maintenance,
and
Cure
Claim
The
obligation
to
pay
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
is
a
form
of
liability
without
fault
that
arises
without 
regard
to
the
negligence
of
the
employer
or
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel.
In
addition,
the
law 
provides
that
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
benefits
are
not
diminished
by
the
sole
or
contributory 
negligence
of
the
injured
seaman. 
The
incident
giving
rise
to
the
injury
must
occur
while
the
seaman
is
“in
the
service
of
the
vessel”
as 
distinguished
from
“in
the
course
of
employment.”
So
presence
on
the
vessel
is
not
necessarily
required. 
For
example,
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
have
been
granted
to
seamen
who
were
injured
or
fell
ill 
while
on
shore
leave. 
A
seaman
may
bring
an
action
for
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
either
against
his
or
her
employer
in 
personam
or
against
the
vessel
in
rem
.
Suit
may
be
brought
against
the
vessel
even
though
the
vessel 
owner
is
not
the
seaman’s
employer. 
A
claim
for
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
against
the
employer
under
the
general
maritime
law
may
be 
brought
in
any
federal
or
state
court
where
the
employer
conducts
business
activities.
If
brought
against 
the
vessel
in
rem
,
the
action
may
be
brought
only
in
federal
court. 
If
brought
as
the
sole
cause
of
action
in
federal
court
under
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
trial
by 
jury
is
not
permitted.
However,
a
claim
for
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
is
generally
coupled
with
a 
claim
under
the
Jones
Act,
and,
as
such,
may
be
tried
before
a
jury. 
Defenses
to
the
Wages,
Maintenance,
and
Cure
Claim
Delay
in
asserting
a
claim
serves
as
a
defense,
although
a
mere
delay
in
asserting
a
maritime
claim
does 
not
bar
the
claim
unless
the
delay
is
unreasonable
and
the
party
against
whom
it
is
asserted
is
unduly 
prejudiced.
If
the
delay
defense
is
applicable,
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
lack
of
prejudice
and 
excusable
delay
shifts
to
the
plaintiff. 
Gross
intoxication
may
be
a
defense
if
a
seaman’s
gross
intoxication
is
the
sole
cause
of
his
or
her
injury 
or
if
it
is
demonstrated
to
be
willful
and
wanton
misconduct.
The
court
will
usually
deny
maintenance
and 
cure
benefits
on
the
grounds
of
willful
misconduct
and
fighting
if
the
seaman
is
the
aggressor. 
57Usually
the
courts
will
allow
a
seaman
whose
illness
preexisted
his
or
her
employment
to
recover 
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
if
the
illness
manifests
itself
while
the
seaman
is
in
the
service
of
the 
vessel.
However,
where
a
seaman
consciously
conceals
from
his
or
her
employer
a
prior
known
disability, 
the
disclosure
of
which
is
plainly
desired,
the
courts
will
usually
deny
maintenance
and
cure
benefits. 
To
recover
maintenance
and
cure,
the
seaman
must
show
actual
expenditures.
One
who
does
not
pay
his 
or
her
own
living
expenses,
such
as
a
seaman
living
at
home
with
his
or
her
parents,
cannot
recover 
maintenance
benefits
from
the
seaman’s
employer. 
Wages,
Maintenance,
and
Cure
Benefits
Wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
provides
seamen
three
basic
entitlements,
which
are
as
follows. 
•
Wages
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
•
A
per
diem
living
allowance
for
the
period
that
the
seaman
is
outside
the
hospital
but
has
not 
reached
the
point
of
maximum
cure,
that
is,
the
point
beyond
which
further
medical
treatment
will 
not
improve
his
or
her
condition
•
The
payment
of
therapeutic,
medical,
and
hospital
expenses
(prosthesis,
etc.)
until
the
seaman 
reaches
the
point
of
maximum
medical
recovery
Maintenance
rate
is
an
amount
equal
to
the
reasonable
cost
in
the
area
where
the
seaman
resides
of
meals 
and
lodging
of
the
same
quality
as
those
that
were
furnished
to
the
seaman
while
he
or
she
was
working 
aboard
the
vessel. 
The
courts
have
determined
that
it
is
appropriate
to
declare
that
a
point
of
maximum
medical
recovery
has 
been
achieved
where
it
appears
that
the
seaman’s
condition
is
incurable,
or
that
future
treatment
will 
merely
relieve
pain
and
suffering
but
not
otherwise
improve
the
seaman’s
physical
condition. 
Under
maintenance
and
cure,
a
seaman
may
also
be
entitled
to
“found.”
Found
is
the
value
of
food
and 
lodging
that
a
seaman
would
have
received
while
aboard
vessels
on
which
he
or
she
would
have
served
in 
the
future
had
the
injury
not
occurred.
The
entitlement
to
found
begins
when
the
entitlement
to 
maintenance
ends.
After
a
seaman
reaches
maximum
cure
and
his
or
her
right
to
maintenance
terminates, 
the
seaman
may
recover
found
on
proper
showing
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
This
element
is 
generally
included
in
a
claim
for
loss
of
“fringe
benefits”
in
a
Jones
Act
suit. 
Compensatory
and
Punitive
Damages
and
Attorneys’
Fees
Upon
receiving
a
claim
for
maintenance
and
cure,
the
shipowner
need
not
immediately
commence 
payments
but
may,
instead,
investigate
and
require
corroboration
of
the
claim.
However,
there
is
an 
escalating
scale
of
liability
for
a
shipowner
who
fails
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
that
are
later 
determined
to
have
been
owed. 
Where
the
shipowner
is
liable
for
maintenance
and
cure
but
has
been
reasonable
in
denying
liability,
the 
shipowner
would
be
liable
only
for
the
amount
of
maintenance
and
cure
owed.
However,
where
the 
shipowner
has
refused
to
pay
without
a
reasonable
defense,
the
shipowner
is
liable
not
only
for 
maintenance
and
cure
but
also
for
any
compensatory
damages
caused
by
the
failure
to
pay. 
Where
the
shipowner
not
only
lacks
a
reasonable
defense
but
also
has
exhibited
callousness
and 
indifference
to
the
seaman’s
plight
or
acted
arbitrarily,
willfully,
and
capriciously
in
handling
the
claim,
a 
shipowner
becomes
liable
not
only
for
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
and
compensatory
damages
but
also 
punitive
damages
and
attorneys’
fees
as
well.
However,
the
continued
availability
of
punitive
damages 
and
attorneys’
fees
has
been
a
topic
for
debate. 
How
To
Insure
Wages,
Maintenance,
and
Cure
Exposures
Employers
can
obtain
coverage
by
purchasing
a
maritime
coverage
endorsement
(WC
00
02
01
B)
to
a 
standard
workers
compensation
policy,
discussed
next. 
58Maritime
Coverage
Endorsement
(WC
00
02
01
B)
The
employers
liability
coverage
part
of
the
2015
National
Council
on
Compensation
Insurance
workers 
compensation
policy
excludes
from
coverage
liability
for
bodily
injury
to
a
master
or
member
of
the
crew 
of
any
vessel.
The
maritime
coverage
endorsement
adds
coverage
for
this
exposure. 
The
endorsement
replaces
the
five
provisions
under
“How
This
Insurance
Applies”
in
the
employers 
liability
coverage
part
section
with
six
provisions
that
are
spelled
out
in
the
endorsement.
Items
A.1.,
4., 
5.,
and
6.
in
the
endorsement
are
identical
to
items
A.1.,
3.,
4.,
and
5.
in
the
policy.
Item
A.2.
in
the 
endorsement
is
very
similar
to
its
counterpart
in
the
basic
policy
language:
it
specifies
that
the 
employment
must
be
necessary
or
incidental
to
work
described
in
the
schedule
that
is
part
of
the
maritime 
coverage
endorsement,
instead
of
to
the
insured’s
work
in
a
state
or
territory
listed
under
item
3.A.
of
the 
information
page. 
However,
item
A.3.
of
the
endorsement
is
unique
to
the
maritime
coverage
endorsement.
It
stipulates
that 
coverage
applies
only
to
bodily
injury
occurring
in
the
territorial
limits
of,
or
in
the
operation
of
a
vessel 
sailing
directly
between
the
ports
of,
the
continental
United
States
of
America,
Alaska,
Hawaii,
or 
Canada.
For
any
insured
whose
employees
might
be
injured
outside
of
these
areas—en
route
to
or
from 
another
country,
for
example—this
coverage
restriction
should
either
be
deleted
from
the
policy
or 
amended
to
cover
all
of
the
territory
in
which
the
insureds
would
ever
conduct
operations. 
The
endorsement
deletes
the
exclusion
in
the
employers
liability
coverage
section
of
the
policy
that 
eliminates
coverage
for
bodily
injury
to
a
master
or
member
of
the
crew
of
any
vessel.
It
also
adds
two 
new
exclusions:
an
exclusion
of
bodily
injury
covered
by
a
protection
and
indemnity
policy
and
an 
exclusion
of
transportation,
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
that
applies
only
if
no
premium
charge
for
this 
coverage
is
shown
in
item
2.
of
the
endorsement
schedule. 
Protection
and
indemnity
(P&I)
policies
are
specialty
liability
coverage
policies
purchased
mainly
by 
vessel
owners
but
also
by
“bareboat”
charterers
of
vessels
(
bareboat
charters
are
those
chartering
only
a 
vessel,
without
the
crew).
P&I
policies
provide
coverage
for
a
number
of
different
types
of
liability
faced 
by
vessel
owners,
including
liability
for
injuries
suffered
by
seamen.
However,
purchase
of
maritime 
liability
coverage
under
the
workers
compensation
policy
is
often
recommended
to
vessel
owners
also 
purchasing
a
P&I
policy,
as
a
safeguard,
because
there
are
situations
where
an
employers
liability
claim 
would
not
be
covered
by
the
P&I
policy.
For
example,
P&I
policies
apply
only
to
injuries
suffered
in 
connection
with
vessels
listed
on
the
P&I
policy
schedule.
A
claim
by
a
worker
injured
in
connection 
with
work
on
a
ship
not
scheduled
on
the
P&I
policy,
perhaps
simply
because
of
an
oversight,
would
not 
be
covered
under
the
P&I
policy.
Assuming
that
the
two
policies
are
properly
arranged,
the
P&I
policy 
would
cover
the
vast
majority
of
any
maritime
employers
liability
claims
against
the
vessel
owner,
and 
the
maritime
coverage
endorsement
to
the
workers
compensation
policy
would
respond
in
the
event
of
a 
claim
that
is
not
covered
under
the
P&I
policy.
In
such
a
case,
the
workers
compensation
underwriter 
should,
at
least
in
theory,
be
willing
to
provide
the
coverage
on
an
“if
any”
basis
for
little
or
no
premium. 
P&I
policies
can
be
written
with
an
exclusion
of
liability
for
bodily
injury
to
crew
members.
In
fact,
it
is 
increasingly
common
for
P&I
policy
underwriters
to
quote
the
coverage
including
and
excluding
liability 
for
injury
to
crew
members,
with
the
pricing
structured
so
as
to
encourage
vessel
owners
to
select
the 
excluding
crew
quote.
In
such
a
case,
the
vessel
owner
would
be
relying
totally
on
the
maritime
liability 
endorsement
to
the
workers
compensation
policy
to
respond
to
all
maritime
employers
liability
claims, 
and
the
pricing
of
the
workers
compensation
endorsement
would
reflect
that
fact. 
Notice
that
the
maritime
coverage
endorsement
excludes
from
coverage
any
bodily
injury
covered
by
a 
P&I
policy
issued
to
the
insured,
“even
if
the
other
policy
does
not
apply
because
of
an
‘other
insurance,’ 
deductible,
or
limitation
of
liability
clause,
or
any
similar
clause.”
P&I
policies
often
have
other
insurance 
clauses
that
stipulate
that
there
is
no
coverage
for
any
claim
covered
by
another
policy.
Insureds 
purchasing
both
a
maritime
coverage
endorsement
to
the
workers
compensation
policy
and
a
P&I
policy 
need
to
make
sure
that
the
other
insurance
clauses
of
these
two
policies
are
amended
as
needed
to
clearly 
indicate
which
policy
is
intended
to
be
primary
with
respect
to
employers
liability
claims. 
P&I
policy
deductibles
typically
range
from
$5,000
to
$25,000
per
occurrence,
whereas
workers
59compensation
policies
usually
do
not
contain
a
deductible
clause.
The
provision
in
this
endorsement 
excludes
bodily
injury
covered
by
a
P&I
policy
even
if
the
other
policy
does
not
apply
because
a 
deductible
clause
prevents
the
insured
from
being
able
to
collect
the
amount
of
the
P&I
policy
deductible 
under
this
endorsement
to
the
workers
compensation
policy. 
P&I
policies
commonly
contain
an
exclusion
for
liability
imposed
by
workers
compensation
law. 
However,
this
exclusion
does
not
affect
coverage
under
the
P&I
policy
for
maritime
employers
liability 
claims,
because
the
laws
that
establish
the
rights
of
seamen
in
the
event
of
on-the-job
injury
are 
employers
liability
laws,
not
workers
compensation
laws. 
Keep
in
mind
that
not
all
employers
whose
employees
might
be
eligible
for
recovery
under
maritime
law 
are
vessel
owners.
Employees
of
barber
shops
or
other
service
businesses
on
board
a
vessel
might
well 
have
valid
claims
for
on-the-job
injury
under
maritime
law.
For
these
businesses,
the
maritime
coverage 
endorsement
to
the
workers
compensation
policy
is
the
only
coverage
available
to
respond
to
maritime 
employers
liability
claims. 
An
action
in
rem
is
a
legal
proceeding
against
the
vessel
(as
opposed
to
an
action
in
personam
,
which
is
a 
legal
proceeding
against
the
employer).
It
is
essentially
a
maritime
lien
that
is
satisfied
by
proceeds
from 
the
sale
of
the
vessel
if
the
action
is
successful.
This
provision
amends
the
policy
to
apply
to
an
action
in 
rem
against
a
vessel
owned
or
chartered
by
the
insured
as
a
suit
against
the
insured. 
The
endorsement
alters
the
policy’s
employers
liability
limits
with
respect
to
liability
for
bodily
injury
to 
a
master
or
crew
member
of
a
vessel.
Instead
of
three
liability
limits,
there
are
two:
a
per
accident
limit 
for
liability
arising
out
of
bodily
injury
by
accident
and
a
policy
aggregate
limit
for
liability
arising
out
of 
bodily
injury
by
disease.
There
is
no
per
employee
disease
limit. 
As
discussed
previously,
the
endorsement
excludes
coverage
for
transportation,
wages,
maintenance,
and 
cure
unless
a
premium
for
that
coverage
is
shown
in
the
endorsement
schedule.
Since
the
premium 
notation
in
the
schedule
triggers
coverage,
it
is
crucial
that
a
premium
(or
other
notation,
such
as 
“included”)
be
inserted
in
the
schedule
if
this
coverage
is
needed.
Vessel
owners
who
also
have
a
P&I 
policy
would
not
normally
need
coverage
for
transportation,
wages,
maintenance,
and
cure
under
this 
endorsement. 
Item
3.
of
the
endorsement
schedule
is
to
be
filled
in
with
the
per
accident
and
disease
aggregate
limits 
that
apply
to
maritime
employers
liability
coverage.
According
to
the
National
Council
on
Compensation 
Insurance
(NCCI)
Basic
Manual,
the
standard
maritime
coverage
limits
are
$100,000
per
accident
and 
$100,000
disease
aggregate.
Currently,
the
standard
employers
liability
limits
cited
in
the
Basic
Manual 
are
$100,000
per
accident,
$100,000
per
employee-disease,
and
$500,000
disease—policy
limit. 
However,
many
umbrella
insurers
currently
require
employers
liability
limits
of
at
least 
$500,000/$500,000/$500,000.
As
a
practical
matter,
it
is
unlikely
that
these
umbrella
insurers
would
be 
willing
to
provide
excess
coverage
over
maritime
limits
of
any
less
than
$500,000/$500,000. 
In
addition
to
the
maritime
coverage
endorsement,
there
are
two
other
NCCI
endorsements
that
can
be 
used
in
certain
circumstances. 
Voluntary
Compensation
Maritime
Coverage
Endorsement
(WC
00
02 
03)
None
of
the
laws
that
give
rise
to
an
employer’s
liability
for
on-the-job
injuries
suffered
by
seamen
are 
workers
compensation
laws
with
scheduled
benefits.
There
is
the
potential
for
injured
seamen
who
can 
prove
some
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
recover
amounts
that
are
much
greater
than
state 
workers
compensation
benefits.
For
this
reason,
many
employers
who
are
subject
to
maritime
employers 
liability
elect
to
purchase
voluntary
workers
compensation
coverage,
using
this
endorsement,
in
addition 
to
maritime
liability
coverage
(using
the
maritime
liability
coverage
endorsement,
WC
00
02
01
B).
This 
approach
allows
the
employer
to
offer
the
injured
employee
the
workers
compensation
benefits
of
the 
state
designated
in
the
endorsement,
in
hopes
of
avoiding
a
negligence
action.
If
the
offer
is
rejected
and 
the
employee
files
suit,
the
maritime
coverage
endorsement
applies. 
60Limited
Maritime
Coverage
Endorsement
(WC
00
02
04)
This
endorsement
eliminates
the
employers
liability
exclusion
for
bodily
injury
to
masters
and
crew 
members
of
a
vessel
with
respect
only
to
work
encompassed
by
the
classifications
listed
in
the 
endorsement
schedule.
It
is
most
often
used
on
policies
covering
service
businesses
for
which
operations 
would
not
normally
bring
the
employees
under
maritime
employers
liability,
when
there
is
a
remote
or 
incidental
connection
with
a
vessel
by
virtue
of
occasional
service
provided
to
a
vessel.
The
endorsement 
schedule
is
to
be
filled
out
with
the
classification
code
numbers
and
associated
work
descriptions
of
the 
workers
providing
the
incidental
service
to
a
vessel. 
Maritime
Employers
Liability
(MEL)
Policy
Vessel
owners
who
do
not
cover
crew
under
their
P&I
policy
with
a
Jones
Act
endorsement
may
purchase 
a
Maritime
Employers
Liability
(MEL)
policy.
The
typical
MEL
policy
covers
an
employer’s
potential 
liability
under
the
Jones
Act
for
loss
of
life,
illness,
and
injury
to
those
employees
classified
as
seamen
in 
the
service
of
a
vessel. 
Some
P&I
insurers
limit
Jones
Act
coverage
to
specified
crew.
This
intent
is
to
limit
coverage
to 
employees
performing
traditional
crew
functions
furthering
the
mission
of
the
vessel
and
to
exclude 
coverage
for
contracting
personnel
working
from
vessels.
If
this
is
the
case,
owners
should
consider
MEL 
coverage. 
MEL
insurance
coverage
responds
through
a
puzzle
of
general
maritime
laws
and
acts. 
MEL
coverage
is
very
broad
in
that
unlike
workers
compensation
and
LHWCA
coverage,
MEL
insurance 
is
not
regulated
on
either
the
state
or
federal
level.
There
is
no
standard
MEL
policy
form,
and
coverage 
can
vary
greatly
among
MEL
products.
There
are
also
no
standard
rates.
So
coverage
can
be
tailored
to 
meet
the
needs
of
the
company.
Coverage
usually
is
provided
in
excess
of
a
deduction
or
retention. 
61Glossary
Allocated
Loss
Adjustment
Expenses
(ALAE)—
Loss
adjustment
expenses
that
are
assignable
or 
allocable
to
specific
claims.
Fees
paid
to
outside
attorneys,
experts,
and
investigators
used
to
defend 
claims
are
examples
of
ALAE.
If
loss
adjustment
expenses
are
not
assigned
to
a
specific
claim
they
are 
unallocated
loss
adjustment
expenses. 
Average
Weekly
Wage
(AWW)—
An
employee’s
pre-injury
earning
capacity,
based
on
earnings
in
the 
period
directly
preceding
a
work-related
injury
or
illness.
The
formula
for
calculating
average
weekly 
wage
varies
by
state. 
basic
premium—
In
a
retrospective
rating
plan,
the
policy
standard
(or
subject)
premium
multiplied
by 
the
basic
premium
factor
or
basic
premium
ratio.
It
provides
for
insurer
expenses,
profit,
and 
contingencies. 
borrowed
servant
rule—
A
common
law
legal
doctrine
stipulating
that
if
an
employer
(usually
referred 
to
in
this
rule
as
the
special
employer)
borrows
a
worker
from
another
employer
(usually
referred
to
in 
this
rule
as
the
general
employer),
the
special
employer
can
be
held
liable
for
the
borrowed
employee’s 
actions,
despite
the
fact
that
a
permanent
employee-employer
relationship
does
not
exist. 
comparative
negligence—
The
rule
used
in
negligence
cases
in
some
states
that
provides
for
computing 
both
the
plaintiff’s
and
the
defendant’s
negligence,
with
the
plaintiff’s
damages
being
reduced
by
a 
percentage
representing
the
degree
of
his
or
her
contributing
fault.
If
the
plaintiff’s
negligence
is
found
to 
be
greater
than
the
defendant’s,
the
plaintiff
will
receive
nothing. 
competitive
state
funds—
State-owned-and-operated
facilities
that
compete
with
commercial
insurers
in 
writing
workers
compensation
insurance
specific
solely
to
that
state.
The
states
with
these
funds
are 
Arizona,
California,
Colorado,
Hawaii,
Idaho,
Kentucky,
Louisiana,
Maine,
Maryland,
Minnesota, 
Missouri,
Montana,
New
Mexico,
New
York,
Oklahoma,
Oregon,
Pennsylvania,
Rhode
Island,
Texas, 
and
Utah. 
consequential
bodily
injury
suits—
A
type
of
lawsuit
insured
by
the
employers
liability
coverage
of
a 
workers
compensation
policy.
In
this
type
of
legal
action,
a
member
of
the
injured
worker’s
family 
purports
to
have
an
injury
that
directly
results
from
the
injury
to
the
employee.
Often,
mental
injuries
are 
alleged.
Legislative
action
in
many
states
has
narrowed
the
applicability
of
this
type
of
lawsuit. 
contributory
negligence—
Negligence
of
a
plaintiff
constituting
a
partial
cause
or
aggravation
of
his
or 
her
injury.
This
doctrine
bars
relief
to
the
plaintiff
in
a
lawsuit
if
the
plaintiff’s
own
negligence 
contributed
to
the
damage.
Contributory
negligence
has
been
superseded
in
many
states
by
other
methods 
of
apportioning
liability. 
cumulative
injury—
A
type
of
worker’s
injury
that
arises
from
the
repetition
of
mentally
or
physically 
traumatic
job
tasks
over
an
extended
length
of
time.
Examples
are
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
and
hearing 
loss. 
Death
on
the
High
Seas
Act
(DOHSA)—
A
federal
remedy
for
the
death
of
seamen
or
other
individuals 
arising
from
negligence,
strict
liability,
or
the
unseaworthiness
of
a
vessel
and
occurring
on
the
high
seas 
that
is
beyond
3
nautical
miles
from
shore
on
a
worldwide
basis. 
deductible
plan—
A
workers
compensation
insurance
rating
plan
under
which
an
insured
retains
each 
loss
up
to
the
deductible
amount,
and
for
which
the
insurer
remains
responsible
for
claim
payment
if
the 
insured
defaults.
The
insurer
is
also
responsible
for
claims
handling
services. 
Defense
Base
Act—
Legislation
that
extends
the
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act 
(LHWCA)
to
apply
to
employees
working
overseas
(a)
on
military
bases
acquired
from
a
foreign
62government
after
1940,
(b)
for
contractors
and
subcontractors
engaged
in
public
work
projects
for
the 
U.S.
government
outside
the
continental
United
States,
or
(c)
employed
outside
the
continental
United 
States
by
a
U.S.
employer
whose
purpose
it
is
to
provide
welfare
or
other
such
services
to
the
Armed 
Forces
as
approved
by
the
Secretary
of
Defense. 
designated
workplaces
exclusion
endorsement—
A
standard
workers
compensation
endorsement
(WC 
00
03
02)
that
removes
coverage
for
injuries
sustained
at
workplaces
listed
in
the
endorsement. 
Commonly
used
on
contractors’
policies
to
exclude
coverage
with
respect
to
projects
on
which
the 
contractor
is
covered
under
a
wrap-up
insurance
program. 
divided
risk
endorsement—
Can
be
attached
to
any
type
of
insurance
policy
for
the
purpose
of 
delineating
exposures
covered
by
particular
insurance
policies
(e.g.,
project
or
site-specific
policies)
in 
order
to
remove
any
possibility
of
double
coverage. 
employee
leasing—
A
permanent
staffing
method
under
which
an
employee
leasing
company
(sometimes 
called
a
professional
employer
organization
(PEO)
or
a
labor
contractor)
provides
all
or
most
of
its 
client’s
employees. 
endemic
disease
coverage—
Specifies
that
workers
compensation
and
employers
liability
coverage
will 
apply
to
injury
or
death
of
an
employee
arising
out
of
a
disease
that
is
peculiar
to
a
foreign
country,
even 
though
the
disease
is
not
covered
under
the
workers
compensation
or
occupational
disease
laws
of
the 
designated
state. 
excess
workers
compensation
insurance—
A
type
of
coverage
available
for
risks
that
choose
to 
self-insure
the
majority
of
workers
compensation
loss
exposures.
Coverage
can
be
specific,
which 
controls
loss
severity
by
placing
a
cap
on
losses
arising
out
of
a
single
occurrence,
and
aggregate,
which 
addresses
loss
frequency
by
providing
coverage
once
a
cumulative
per
occurrence
loss
limit
is
breached. 
exclusive
remedy—
A
component
of
workers
compensation
statutes
that
bars
employees
injured
on
the 
job
from
making
a
tort
liability
claim
against
their
employers.
The
benefits
provided
under
workers 
compensation
are
the
sole
remedy
available
to
injured
employees. 
expatriate—
A
person
living
and
working
in
a
country
other
than
his
or
her
own
homeland. 
experience
modifier—
A
factor
developed
by
measuring
the
difference
between
the
insured’s
actual
past 
experience
and
the
expected
or
actual
experience
of
the
class.
This
factor
may
be
either
a
debit
or
credit 
and,
therefore,
will
increase
or
decrease
the
standard
premium
in
response
to
past
loss
experience
and 
produce
a
premium
that
is
more
representative
of
the
actual
loss
experience
of
an
insured. 
extraterritorial
coverage—
The
extension
of
state
workers
compensation
law
to
provide
benefits
for 
workers
hired
in
the
state
but
injured
while
working
in
another
state.
This
term
is
also
used
in 
international
insurance
to
denote
coverage
for
work-related
injuries
occurring
outside
the
boundaries
of 
the
country
of
hire. 
Federal
Coal
Mine
Health
and
Safety
Act
(FCMHSA)—
Legislation
passed
in
1969
that
provides 
no-fault
coverage
for
employees
injured
while
working
the
coal
mines
located
in
the
United
States.
A
key 
component
of
the
law
is
Title
IV,
which
deals
with
black
lung
disease. 
Federal
Employers
Liability
Act
(FELA)—
A
federal
statute
that
provides
for
a
liberalization
of
the 
rules
for
determining
tort
liability
applicable
to
the
liability
of
railroads
to
their
employees
for
personal 
injury.
Unlike
under
normal
tort
rules
where
the
injured
party
must
prove
negligence
on
the
part
of
the 
defendant,
under
FELA,
the
employee
need
only
show
that
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer 
contributed
to
the
injury. 
found—
The
value
of
food
and
lodging
that
a
seaman
would
have
received
while
aboard
vessels
that
he
or 
she
would
have
served
on
in
the
future
had
the
injury
not
occurred.
The
entitlement
to
found
begins
when 
the
entitlement
to
maintenance
ends.
After
a
seaman
reaches
maximum
cure
and
his
or
her
right
to 
maintenance
terminates,
the
seaman
may
recover
found
on
proper
showing
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the 
employer.
This
element
is
generally
included
in
a
claim
for
loss
of
“fringe
benefits”
in
a
Jones
Act
suit. 
general
maritime
law—
A
common
law
concept
of
which
origin
is
rooted
in
historic
sea
codes
and
63requires
the
owner
of
the
vessel
to
provide
the
entire
crew
with
transportation,
wages,
room
and
board 
(maintenance),
and
medical
services
(cure)
for
the
duration
of
the
voyage. 
guaranteed
cost—
Premiums
charged
on
a
prospective
basis
without
adjustment
for
loss
experience 
during
the
policy
period.
A
rate
is
multiplied
by
the
appropriate
exposure
base
(e.g.,
sales,
payroll, 
number
of
vehicles,
or
square
footage)
to
yield
the
premium.
Only
a
change
in
the
exposure
base
during 
the
policy
period
will
cause
the
premium
to
vary. 
high
seas—
Those
seas
beyond
3
nautical
miles
from
the
shore
of
any
state,
territory,
or
dependency
of 
the
United
States,
and
the
territorial
waters
of
a
foreign
nation. 
Incurred
But
Not
Reported
(IBNR)
losses—
An
estimate
of
the
amount
of
an
insurer’s
(or 
self-insurer’s)
liability
for
claim-generating
events
that
have
taken
place
but
have
not
yet
been
reported
to 
the
insurer
or
self-insurer. 
incurred
losses—
The
total
amount
of
paid
claims
and
loss
reserves
associated
with
a
particular
period
of 
time,
usually
a
policy
year.
Incurred
losses
are
customarily
computed
in
accordance
with
the
following 
formula:
losses
incurred
during
the
period,
plus
outstanding
losses
at
the
end
of
the
period,
less 
outstanding
losses
at
the
beginning
of
the
period. 
incurred
loss
retro—
An
insurance
risk
financing
plan
under
which
the
insured
pays
a
premium
based
on 
actual
loss
experience
incurred
during
the
policy
period.
Incurred
losses
include
the
outstanding
reserves 
and
expenses
of
the
claims
in
addition
to
the
actual
paid
indemnity
and
medical
costs. 
in
rem
endorsement—
A
workers
compensation
coverage
endorsement
extending
coverage
for
suits
filed 
against
the
value
of
the
ship
by
an
injured
crew
member
seeking
for
the
recovery
of
damages.
The
suit 
must
cite
the
unseaworthy
condition
of
the
vessel
as
proximate
cause
of
the
damages. 
interstate
experience
rating—
An
experience
rating
plan
for
risks
operating
on
a
multistate
(interstate) 
basis
that
utilizes
the
experience
developed
within
more
than
one
state. 
intrastate
experience
rating—
An
experience
rating
plan
that
utilizes
the
experience
developed
within 
one
state
only. 
Jones
Act
(Merchant
Marine
Act
of
1920)—
Provides
seamen
with
a
negligence
remedy
for
on-the-job 
injury
without
having
to
overcome
employer
defenses
of
assumption
of
the
risk
or
fellow
servant
liability. 
large
deductible
plan—
A
cash
flow
workers
compensation
insurance
program
that
allows
the
insured
to 
retain
a
portion
of
each
loss
through
a
substantial
deductible
and
to
transfer
onto
an
insurer
losses
in 
excess
of
that
deductible. 
Longshore
and
Harbor
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA)—
A
federal
law
that
provides
no-fault 
workers
compensation
benefits
to
employees
other
than
masters
or
crew
members
of
a
vessel
injured
in 
maritime
employment—generally,
in
loading,
unloading,
repairing,
or
building
a
vessel. 
Loss
Conversion
Factor
(LCF)—
A
factor
used
in
the
retrospective
rating
formula
that
provides
a
charge 
to
cover
unallocated
claims
and
the
cost
of
the
insurer’s
claim
services.
Since
the
charge
is
developed
as 
part
of
the
formula,
the
amount
the
insured
will
pay
for
unallocated
loss
expenses
is
a
function
of
losses. 
loss
development—
The
difference
between
the
original
loss
as
initially
reserved
by
an
insurer
and
its 
subsequent
evaluation
at
a
later
date
or
at
the
time
of
its
final
disposal
because
of
(a)
inflation
during
the 
time
period
in
which
losses
are
reported
and
ultimately
settled
and
(b)
time
lags
between
the
occurrence 
of
claims
and
the
time
they
are
actually
reported
to
an
insurer.
To
account
for
these
increases,
a
“loss 
development
factor”
(LDF)
is
usually
applied
to
more
accurately
project
the
ultimate
claim
amount. 
loss
limitation—
An
optional
feature
of
a
retrospective
rating
plan
that
limits
or
“caps”
the
amount
of
loss 
(usually
at
the
$100,000
level,
or
more)
that
would
otherwise
be
applied
to
the
calculation
of
premium. 
An
additional
premium
is
charged
for
this
feature
by
means
of
an
“excess
loss
premium
factor”
(ELPF). 
loss
of
consortium
suit—
A
legal
action
often
brought
by
the
spouse
of
the
injured
worker
that
alleges
the 
loss
of
spousal
services
including
but
not
limited
to
companionship,
help
with
household
duties,
and 
sexual
relations.
Suits
of
this
type
can
also
be
brought
by
parents
or
children
of
the
injured
worker.
64loss
reserve—
An
estimate
of
the
value
of
a
claim
or
group
of
claims

an 
estimate
of
the
amount
for
which
a
particular
claim
will
ultimately

for
their
entire
books
of
business
to
estimate
their
future
liabilities.

is
able
to
provide.

this
obligation
is
owed
a
seaman

as
well
as 
sicknesses
that
generally
do
not
fall
within
the
provisions
of
state
compensation
acts. 
 
wages—
A
sailor’s
usual
wages

monopolistic
state
funds—
Jurisdictions
where
an
employer
must
obtain
workers
compensation 
insurance
from
a
compulsory
state
fund
or
qualify
as
a
self-insurer
(as
is
allowed
in
four
of
the
states). 
The
following
states/jurisdictions
are
monopolistic
fund
states:
North

multiple
coordinated
policies—
An
arrangement
of
workers
compensation
insurance
coverage
typically 
used
in
the
residual

to
assure
that
workers
leased
through
an
employee
leasing 
company/professional
employer
organization
(PEO)
are
afforded
coverage
without
gaps
or
overlaps.
The 
leasing
company/PEO
and
each

its
clients
purchase
separate
policies
with
a
common
expiration
date, 
written

that
specifies
which
leased 
employees
are
covered.

be
caused
by,
exposure
to
environmental
factors 
associated
with
employment,
including
acute
and
chronic
illnesses
or
diseases
that
may
be
caused
by 
inhalation,
absorption,
ingestion,
or
direct
contact.
State
workers
compensation
laws
vary
as
to
whether 
coverage
is
afforded
for
occupational
disease. 
occupational
injury—
An
injury
arising
in
the

and
scope
of
employment
that
is
caused
by
factors

for
an 
insured’s
employees
traveling
through

the
insured’s
home 
state.
The
endorsement
expands
the
policy
so
that
an
injured
employee
can
receive
compensation
benefits 
as
prescribed
by
the
other
states
listed
on
the
endorsement. 
Outer
Continental
Shelf
Lands

(OCSLA)—
Extends
the
benefits
of
the
Longshore
and
Harbor 
Workers’
Compensation
Act
(LHWCA)
to
workers
injured
or
killed
upon
fixed
structures,
for
example, 
oil
well
platforms,
that
are
permanently
attached
to
the
Outer
Continental
Shelf
(i.e.,
all
submerged
lands 
that
lie
beyond
the
coastal
states’
territorial
boundaries,
to
a
water
depth
of
200
meters
or
where 
exploration
is
feasible)
for
the
purpose
of
natural
resource
exploration
or
development. 
65paid
loss
retrospective
rating
plan—
An
insurance
cash
flow

they
are
paid
out
in
claims.
Used
most
frequently
with
workers
compensation
and
general 
liability
lines. 
payroll
limitation—
A
limitation
on
the
amount
of
payroll
for
certain
classifications
used
for
the 
development
of
premium.
In
workers
compensation
insurance,
it
typically
applies
only
to
sole
proprietors, 
executive
officers,
partners,
and
certain
noted
classifications.
The
limitation
varies
by
state. 
permanent
partial
disability—
A
workers
compensation
disability
level
in
which
the
injured
employee
is 
still
able
to
work
but
not
with
the
skill
and
efficiency
demonstrated
prior
to
the
injury.
As
a
result,
the 
earning
capability
of
the
worker
is
affected.
Most
workers
compensation
statutes
provide
for
scheduled 
benefits
based
on
the
percentage
of
disability. 
permanent
total
disability—
A
class
of
workers
compensation
disability
in
which
the
injured
employee 
is
incapable
of
ever
working
again
at
any
employment.
Under
most
statutes,
the
employee
will
receive 
weekly
wages

premium
discount—

volume
discount
applied
to
premiums
that
acknowledges
the
administrative
cost 
savings
associated
with
larger
premiums.
Mostly
used
in
workers
compensation
insurance,
it
is
available 
in
states
where
rates
are
approved
and
published. 
primary
duty
rule—
A
seldom-applied
rule
that
provides
that
a
seaman
may
not
recover
from
his
or
her 
employer
for
injuries
caused
by
his
or
her
own
failure
to
perform
a
duty
imposed
on
him
or
her
by
his
or 
her
employment.
This
defense
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
Walker-Reinhart
doctrine. 
Protection
and
Indemnity
(P&I)
insurance—
Liability
insurance
for
practically
all
maritime
liability 
risks
associated
with
the
operation
of
a
vessel,
other
than
that
covered
under
a
workers
compensation 
policy
and
under
the
collision
clause
in
a
hull
policy.
There
is
no
standard
P&I
form
with
the
specific 
terms
and
conditions
for
each
insured
tailored
by
underwriters
based
on
the
nature
of
the
risk
and
the 
character
and
amount
of
insurance
desired
by
the
insured.
Additionally
note
that
since
the
P&I
policy
is 
essentially
a
contract
of
indemnity,
the
insurer
is
not
obligated
to
pay
unless
the
insured
must
actually
pay 
the
claim. 
repatriation—
Bringing
back
to
one’s
homeland,
generally
referring
to
transportation
of
an
injured
or
ill 
employee
back
to
his
or
her
home
country.
This
coverage
is
sometimes
added
to
the
workers 
compensation
policy
by
a
manuscript
foreign
voluntary
compensation
endorsement. 
residual
market—
Insurance
market
systems
for
various
lines
of
coverage
(most
often
workers 
compensation,
personal
automobile
liability,
and
property
insurance)
that
are
a
coverage
source
of
last 
resort
for
firms/individuals
rejected
by
voluntary
market
insurers.
Insurers
writing
specific
coverage
lines 
in
a
given
state
are
required
to
assume
the
profits
or
losses
accruing
from
insuring
that
state’s
residual 
risks
in
proportion
to
their
share
of
the
total
voluntary
market
premiums
written
in
that
state. 
Residual
Market
Load
(RML)—
A
factor
applied
to
workers
compensation
policies
by
insurers
to 
recover
costs
assessed
them
by
states
for
deficits
in
the
residual
markets. 
retrospective
rating—
A
rating
plan
that
adjusts
the
premium,
subject
to
a
certain
minimum
and 
maximum,
to
reflect
the
current
loss
experience
of
the
insured.
Retrospective
rating
combines
actual 
losses
with
graded
expenses
to
produce
a
premium
that
more
accurately
reflects
the
current
experience
of 
the
insured.
Adjustments
are
performed
periodically,
after
the
policy
has
expired. 
schedule
rating—
Modification
of
manual
rates
either
upward
(debits)
or
downward
(credits)
to
reflect 
the
individual
risk
characteristics
of
the
subject
of
insurance. 
self-insurance—
A
system
whereby
a
firm
sets
aside
an
amount
of
its
monies
to
provide
for
any
losses 
that
occur—losses
that
could
ordinarily
be
covered
under
an
insurance
program.
Self-insurance
is
a
means 
of
capturing
the
cash
flow
benefits
of
unpaid
loss
reserves
and
also
offers
the
possibility
of
reducing 
expenses
typically
incorporated
within
a
traditional
insurance
program. 
standard
premium—
The
premium
developed
by
multiplying
the
appropriate
rate
by
the
proper
exposure 
unit.
This
figure
is
then
modified
by
experience
rating,
if
applicable.
66state
funds—
State-owned-and-operated
organizations
that
write
workers
compensation
insurance.
Some 
states
have
monopolistic
funds,
which
are
the
only
market
for
workers
compensation
insurance
in
those 
states.
Other
states
have
competitive
funds
that
compete
with
insurers
in
that
state
only. 
stop
gap
endorsement—
An
endorsement
that
provides
employers
liability
coverage
for
work-related 
injuries
arising
out
of
incidental
operations
or
exposures
in
monopolistic
fund
states.
The
endorsement
is 
attached
to
the
workers
compensation
policy
when
the
employer
has
operations
in
nonmonopolistic
states 
or
the
general
liability
policy
when
the
employer
operates
exclusively
in
a
monopolistic
fund
state. 
tax
multiplier—
A
component
of
a
retrospective
rating
plan
that
represents
the
costs
associated
with 
taxes,
assessments,
and
other
fees
that
the
insurer
must
pay
to
the
states
on
premiums
written
and 
collected. 
temporary
partial
disability—
A
workers
compensation
disability
level
in
which
the
injured
worker
is 
temporarily
precluded
from
performing
a
certain
set
of
job
skills
but
who
can
still
work
at
a
reduced
level. 
Since
the
condition
is
temporary,
compensation
is
based
on
the
difference
between
the
two
earning
levels. 
temporary
total
disability—
A
workers
compensation
disability
level
in
which
the
injured
worker
is 
rendered
completely
unable
to
perform
any
job
functions
on
a
temporary
basis.
The
employee
is
expected 
to
make
a
full
recovery
and
return
to
work.
In
the
interim,
compensation
paid
is
usually
a
percentage
of 
weekly
wages
until
the
worker
returns
to
the
job. 
third-party-over
action—
A
type
of
action
in
which
an
injured
employee,
after
collecting
workers 
compensation
benefits
from
the
employer,
sues
a
third
party
for
contributing
to
the
employee’s
injury. 
Then,
because
of
some
type
of
contractual
relationship
between
the
third
party
and
the
employer,
the 
liability
is
passed
back
to
the
employer. 
voluntary
compensation
endorsement—
Enables
an
employer
to
extend
the
benefits
provided
by
the 
workers
compensation
act
to
employees
who
may
not
be
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
act, 
such
as
executive
officers,
partners,
sole
proprietors,
farm
workers,
domestic
employees,
or
employees 
traveling
overseas. 
voluntary
compensation
maritime
coverage
endorsement—
Allows
an
employer
with
maritime 
workers
compensation
exposure
to
offer
benefits
of
the
state
designated
in
the
endorsement
to
an
injured 
employee
or
survivors
of
a
deceased
employee.
