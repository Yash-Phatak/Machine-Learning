1 Introduction 
This course is designed to give a moderately experienced insura nce person a detailed look at the key 
provisions contained within a corporate directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance policy and how 
they function within various cla ims scenarios. The course begin s by describing the policy’s three key 
insuring agreements and then exa mines the covered persons, cove red organizations, and covered acts 
provisions. Next, it analyzes two of the policy’s most importan t defined terms: “covered damages” and 
“covered losses.” It continues by describing the policy’s defen se coverage provisions and defense 
procedures. The manner in which  a D&O policy’s limits, retentio ns, and coinsurance provisions apply is 
considered next, followed by a look at the policy’s most import ant conditions. The course reviews the 
exclusions section of the policy and the claims-made coverage t rigger provisions. The final chapters 
analyze excess D&O liability polic ies and provide an overview o f the specialized policy forms written to 
cover privately held companies.  
A glossary, which follows the c oncluding chapter, contains defi nitions of key words, phrases, and 
acronyms used in this text. Be s ure to check the glossary if yo u are unsure of some te rm or have forgotten 
what an acronym stands for.  
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to 
1. distinguish among a corporate D&O liability policy’s three majo r insuring agreements; 
2. recognize how the covered persons , covered organizations, and c overed acts provisions 
coordinate within these three insuring agreements;  
3. identify the “covered damages” and “covered losses” definitions  and recognize how they first 
define and then limit the scope o f coverage the policy provides ; 
4. recognize the extent to which D&O policies provide employment p ractices liability (EPL) 
coverage and how endorsements to the forms can further expand u pon the extent of such 
coverage; 
5. recognize the scope of defense c overage provided by the D&O pol icies, distinguish between duty 
to defend and non-duty to defe nd policies, and recognize how th ese two provisions function in a 
claim situation; 
6. recognize how a D&O policy’s lim its, retentions, and coinsuranc e provisions coordinate with the 
policy’s three key insuring agreements;  
7. identify and recognize the impact of the critical policy condit ions found within D&O forms, 
including severability, cancellation, subrogation, other insura nce, arbitration, presumptive 
indemnification provisions, and priority of payments provisions ;  
8. distinguish between “limited” a nd “full” severability provision s; 
9. identify the major exclusions f ound within D&O policies, distin guishing between the different 
versions of the same exclusion , and recognizing the rationale f or each of these exclusions; 
10. given relevant information, rec ognize how the terms claims firs t made, post-policy reporting 
window, retroactive date, discovery provision, extended reporti ng, and runoff provisions relate to 
such triggers and apply in claim situations;   
2 11. recognize how excess D&O liability p olicies are structured to i nteract with primary D&O 
coverage and how the major polic y provisions function in a clai m situation; and 
12. identify the unique exposures of privately held organizations a nd how the coverage features 
within the policies differ from those contained in the forms de signed to cover corporate/for-profit 
firms.  
3 Chapter 1 
The D&O Policy: Insuring Agreements 
Overview 
This chapter analyzes the four d istinct insuring agreements fou nd within public company D&O policy 
forms.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. distinguish among Side A, Side B , Side C, and Side D coverages;   
2. recognize common coverage variati ons and identify their advanta ges and disadvantages; and 
3. recognize examples of claims to which each coverage applies.  
The first insuring agreement—know n as “Side A” coverage, also t ermed “directors and officers liability 
insurance” or “personal assets pr otection”—provides liability c overage for individual directors and 
officers of the parent corporation. The second insuring agreeme nt—known as “Side B” coverage, also 
termed “corporate reimbursement insurance”—reimburses the corpo ration for payments it is legally 
obligated (or permitted) to make in indemnifying its directors and officers for liability claims made 
against them, protecting the balance sheet of the organization itself. The third—known as “Side C” 
coverage, also termed “entity c overage”—covers the corporation for claims made against it solely relating 
to the corporation’s securities (i.e., shares of publicly trade d stock). The fourth—known as “Side D” 
coverage, or “derivative investig ation coverage”—pays the cost of investigations that are required when a 
derivative claim is made agains t the insured corporation.  
   
4 The coverage provided by D&O po licy forms is illustrated in Exh ibit 1.1.

D&O Liability Coverage (“Side A”) 
The first insuring agreement of a  D&O policy covers what is kno wn as the “direct” or “nonindemnifiable” 
liability of an organization’s directors and officers. If such persons are found liable to third parties—and 
the corporation is not legally liable for reimbursing the direc tors and officers and/or is financially unable 
to indemnify the directors and officers—this portion of the pol icy promises to indemnify them for claim 
payments and defense costs they incur as a result of such liabi lity.  
Side A is an extremely importa nt coverage and applies in three situations: (1) when the parent 
organization is not legally requi red or able to indemnify direc tors and officers for a specific claim, (2) 
when the defendant directors a nd officers must pay a settlement  or judgment in a shareholder derivative 
lawsuit (derivative claims are actions brought on behalf of a c orporation against its own directors and 
officers, as opposed to claims brought on behalf of an individu al or a group), or (3) when the corporation 
lacks the financial capacity to indemnify the directors and off icers, which usually occurs when it is 
insolvent. In each of these situa tions, Side A of the policy pr ovides indemnification of the corporation’s 
directors and officers on a “direct” basis. 
Side A-Only D&O Policies 
Recognizing the importance of t hese exposures, beginning in the  early part of the 2000s, insurers began to 
more frequently offer what are known as “Side A-only” policies.  Actually, as early as 1986, Corporate 
Officers & Directors Assurance Ltd. (CODA) began writing polici es of this type. Such policies are often 
written in conjunction with “prim ary” D&O policies (which conta in both Side A and Side B coverage and 
frequently Side C and Side D coverage). Side A policies can pro vide coverage on an excess basis (excess 
of the corporation’s primary or “ ABC” D&O policy) and often cov er only independent/outside directors 
(i.e., directors who are not employees of the company).  
The most frequent intent of Side A-only policies is twofold. 
 To provide excess limits in the event the limits under the prim ary form are exhausted by claim 
payments and defense costs.   
5  To “drop down” over primary forms in the event that an exclusio n or other coverage restriction 
applies under the primary form.  
Corporate Entity Is Not an  Insured under Side A Policies 
Another key point to recognize is that the parent organization is not an insured under Side A-only 
policies. Rather, the forms onl y provide coverage for the direc tors and officers—not for the corporate 
organization’s obligation to indemnify such persons. In effect,  Side A policies operate like D&O umbrella 
policies but only as respects the coverage provided by a Side A  policy. 
Exhibit 1.2 provides a descripti on of the advantages provided b y Side A-only coverage forms. 
Exhibit 1.2 
Advantages of Side A-Only Coverage Forms 
Coverage Assured in Bankruptcy Situations  
One of the most important advant ages of a Side A-only policy is  that, under a primary D&O form, 
there is sometimes uncertainty a s to whether directors and offi cers have access to the proceeds of 
such policies in the event a com pany declares bankruptcy. More specifically, there have been a 
number of conflicting court decis ions on this issue. Some decis ions indicate that the proceeds of a 
D&O policy belong to the director s and officers. Conversely, ot her decisions have held that such 
proceeds are the property of t he bankruptcy trustee (because th e trustee “stands in the shoes” of 
the corporate entity), a holding that usually precludes reimbur sement of insured  directors and 
officers. However, since the corporate organization is not an i nsured under Side A-only forms (as is 
the case under primary D&O polic ies), coverage for the director s is not in doubt, even when a 
company is insolvent and a bankr uptcy trustee seeks access to p olicy proceeds.  
Inapplicability of Severable Warranties  
Another obstacle to a director’ s obtaining access to primary D& O policy proceeds is the application 
of nonseverable warranties. This refers to a situation in which  coverage for a director or officer is 
barred because of fraud or conceal ment by a corporation’s CEO o r CFO in providing information 
within the application for cove rage. For example, assume a CEO knows of a situation that is likely to 
produce a claim. The CEO intent ionally conceals such circumstan ces in the application for D&O 
coverage. Depending on the wordi ng of the warrant y provision wi thin the primary D&O policy, 
coverage for the claim could be barred as to all directors and officers under the policy. This is 
because such warranties are no t always severable, meaning that the CEO’s fraudulent statements 
in the application will bind even directors who had no knowledg e of these circumstances. However, 
under Side A-only policy forms, this  otherwise nonseverable war ranty (which ordinarily defeats 
coverage for nonculpable director s and officers) does not apply , meaning coverage would be 
available under such circumstances. 
Exclusions for Financial Restatements  
Yet another coverage gap is creat ed by exclusions for coverage of claims produced by financial 
restatements. (A financial rest atement occurs when a publicly t raded corporation must make a 
material revision to one of its  recently released earnings stat ements, almost always in a manner 
indicating that profits were lower or losses were larger than o riginally reported.) Again, such 
exclusions do not appear in Side A-only policy forms. Therefore , despite the presence of such an 
exclusion in a primary D&O form, c overage would nonetheless app ly to directors insured by a Side 
A-only policy, because most types  of Side A-only forms would “d rop down” over the coverage gap 
caused by the financial restatement exclusion in the primary po licy.  
   
6 Exhibit 1.2  
Advantages of Side A-Only Coverage Forms 
Nonrescindable Policy  
Side A-only forms cannot be re scinded based on fraud committed by any insureds under the policy. 
In contrast, under traditional D&O  policies (those that cover S ides A, B, C, and sometimes D) an 
insurer can rescind an insuranc e policy when it finds that the insured has misrepresented a material 
fact when applying for coverage, such as providing a fraudulent  financial statement with its 
application. (The rescission of a  policy means that the policy never went into effect. Under such 
circumstances, an insurer must r eturn the entire premium to the  insured.)  
Although coverage under a Side A policy would be denied as to a n insured(s) that intentionally 
provided false information on an application, such coverage wou ld still apply to other, nonculpable 
insureds under the policy, which  is not always the case under p rimary policy forms. 
Additional Policy Limits Availa ble for Mega-Claim Situations  
Since D&O policies are written with a combined single limit for  all three insuring agreements (see 
Exhibit 1.1), when the corporat e entity is named in mega-securi ties litigation (e.g., $100+ million), 
policy limits are usually deplet ed by the claim applicable to C overage C (entity se curities coverage), 
leaving little or no monies ava ilable for claims that also name  directors and officers. However, the 
presence of a Side A-only policy , which contains a “dedicated” limit for directors and officers—and is 
not accessible by the corporat e entity—solves this problem.  
Limited Conduct Exclusions  
Although all Side A forms are not uniform in this regard, the m ore favorable (for the insured) 
versions typically have very lim ited conduct exclusions for dir ectors and officers. The exclusion, 
which is meant to bar coverage in s cenarios in wh ich directors and officers have had financial gains 
to which they were not legally entitled and/or committed fraudu lent or criminal acts, only applies to 
clearly “deliberate” acts in the more favorable forms that comm only provide Side A-only coverage. 
Furthermore, the exclusion is  frequently only applicable after both “final” and “non-appealable” 
adjudication establishes the im proper conduct, meaning that cov erage has a greater chance of 
existing throughout extended liti gation. Lastly, the conduct ex clusions in Side A-only forms 
frequently do not apply to def ense costs, independent directors , or claims of the employment 
practices variety.  
The Two Types of Side A-Only Coverage 
There are two types of Side A-only policies: (1) those written on a pure excess basis and (2) those 
providing “true” umbrella coverage  (also called difference-in-c onditions (DIC) coverage).  
 Pure Excess Side A-Only Policies —Such forms afford coverage on the same basis as the 
primary D&O policy. That is, coverage is subject to the same te rms and conditions of the 
underlying policy(ies). The only additional coverage that “pure  excess Side A-only” forms 
provide is limits excess of primary coverage. These forms are t ypically the less expensive of the 
two types.  
 Umbrella (DIC) Side A-Only Policies —“Umbrella (DIC) Side A-only” policies provide “true” 
umbrella coverage over a primary D&O policy and are therefore s ubject to their own terms and 
conditions. Accordingly, they will “drop down” over the Side A coverage provided within the 
primary D&O policy in situations w here the primary policy conta ins an exclusion or other 
provision that precludes coverage. 
   
7 Variations within Side A-Only Coverage 
There are two key variations of Side A-only coverage. First, so me corporations purchase an “all Side A” 
program, and, second, a number of corporations purchase a Side A policy applying only to their 
independent/outside (i.e., nonemployee) directors. 
 “All Side A” Program —A minority of corporations c hoose to purchase only Side A cove rage, 
leaving their Side B (corporate reimbursement), Side C (entity securities), and Side D (derivative 
investigations) exposures self-ins ured. The rationale behind th is approach is that, first, such 
companies foresee a low probability of (1) claims against their  directors and officers and (2) 
securities claims against the corporate entity. In addition, ev en in the event of a claim, these 
organizations feel their balance sheets are strong enough to wi thstand whatever defense costs and 
claim payments may be required to respond to such claims. Accor dingly, they believe the only 
type of coverage that is really necessary is Side A, because it  applies in situations in which the 
corporation cannot legally indemnify the directors and officers  or when the corporation cannot 
indemnify the directors due to its insolvency.  
 Coverage for Outside/Independent  Directors Only (“IDL” Coverage )—A second variation of 
Side A-only policies is those covering only outside/independent directors while not covering 
“inside” directors (i.e., directors who are also employees of t he company). An argument can be 
made, and a number of actual clai m situations have proven, that  outside directors, given their lack 
of day-to-day contact with and control over the inner workings of the corporate organization, 
require a greater level of protection compared to “inside” dire ctors and officers. Accordingly, so-
called IDL (independent directors liability) policies fill this  need. Such forms also serve as a 
recruitment tool for independent directors who want to serve on  a corporate board but seek 
additional protection of their personal assets.  
The need for IDL coverage was illu strated when a number of outs ide/independent directors at Enron and 
WorldCom were forced to contribute personal funds to securities  liability settlements with shareholders, 
since coverage limits of Enron’s corporate policies had been ex hausted by claims against the company’s 
inside directors. If IDL polici es had been in effect, such cove rage would have provided additional limits 
that could have covered the settle ments and prevented the indep endent directors from having to resolve 
claims using their personal funds. 
Corporate Reimbursement Coverage (“Side B”) 
The second insuring agreement in a  D&O policy is called “Side B ” or corporate reimbursement coverage. 
This part of the policy covers t he parent company’s obligation to indemnify the insured directors or 
officers for claim payments and defense costs associated with w rongful acts the directors or officers 
committed while serving in their capacity as such. The followin g documents typically require 
corporations to indemnify their directors and officers for wron gful acts. 
 The organization’s charter or bylaws  
 Individual agreements with a d irector or officer as a condition  of employment  
 State indemnification statutes  
 Common law requirements in the state of incorporation  
   
8 The Corporation Is Required To Indemnify Retention Amounts 
In situations in which corporati ons are required to indemnify d irectors and officers against claims from 
wrongful acts, the corporation is  also usually required to reim burse any retention amounts that may not 
apply to the limits of liability u nder a D&O policy. For instan ce, if a D&O claim requires a director to 
expend $5 million in settlement a nd defense costs, the organiza tion is required to reimburse the full $5 
million, even if a $1 million polic y retention applies to the c orporate indemnification portion of the 
policy. This is important because with the exception of situati ons involving corporate insolvency or a 
derivative claim, the vast majority of D&O claims (against the directors and officers) are paid under the 
corporate reimbursement (“Side B” coverage) provision of the po licy, rather than under Side A (D&O 
coverage). Thus, in the event of  a claim, the corporation—not t he individual directors and officers—must 
ultimately absorb the cost of the retention stated in the D&O p olicy. 
Complementary Nature of the Two Insuring Agreements 
The two insuring agreements, A a nd B, of a D&O policy are compl ementary. That is, if a director or 
officer incurs liability of a type for which the company is req uired to indemnify that director or officer, 
the D&O insurer will make the required indemnification on behal f of the company under Side B of the 
policy. On the other hand, when the company provides no indemni fication (because it is insolvent, not 
legally able to indemnify, or in a derivative claim situation),  the D&O policy will afford direct coverage 
for the director(s) or officer(s) under Side A of the policy. 
One confusing factor relating to indemnification is that state law defines the types of liabilities for which 
a company may or may not indemnify its directors and officers. However, if the amounts a director or 
officer is required to pay (because of a particular wrongful ac t) are not indemnifiable by the company 
under the applicable state law , coverage may still exist under the D&O policy’s other insuring 
agreement—the one providing direct  coverage for the directors a nd officers themselves (i.e., Side  A 
coverage). 
Entity Securities Coverage (“Side C”) 
Coverage under Sides A and B of a D&O policy is limited to situ ations in which a lawsuit specifically 
names the organization’s directors and officers (either individ ually or collectively). Coverage under Sides 
A and B will be denied if the l awsuit names only the parent org anization. Instead, coverage in this 
situation would apply under Side C.  
Side C Coverage Is Only for Securities-Related Claims 
To address this “gap” in Sides A and B coverage when the corpor ate organization is named in a lawsuit 
(either alone or in conjunction w ith directors and officers), i n the mid-1990s, insurers introduced what is 
known as “entity coverage.” As Pete r Taffae wrote in a December  21, 2009, article published on 
PropertyCasualty360.com (“The AB Cs of D&O Insurance Clauses”), Side C can effectively trace its roots 
back to a US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Nordstrom, Inc. vs. Chubb & Son, Inc. In the 
decision, it was determined that “a means of differentiating th e liability between directors, officers and 
the legal entity did not exist in securities litigation.” As a result, “predetermined allocation” endorsements 
were introduced across the industry, specifying the liability a llocation between individuals and the entity 
itself. From this, separate Side C coverage eventually arose. 
Given the fact that a publicly traded corporate organization’s single largest exposure relates to its 
potential liability as an issuer of securities, the public comp any D&O policies that provide entity coverage 
do so only as respects securities claims . Such coverage is afforded unde r a separate section of a D&O 
policy, also known as “Side C” coverage. More specifically, thi s section of the policy covers the 
corporate entity in situations in which a claimant names the co rporate entity alone or names both the 
entity and individual directors and officers in a claim associa ted with securities.  
9 An Example: A Noncovered Claim v ersus a Cover ed Claim under Sid e C 
Assume that a claimant sues an insured corporation, alleging th at the corporation had breached a contract 
to deliver $2 million of its pr oduct. The claimant’s lawsuit ci tes damages resulting from the company’s 
failure to deliver its product. T here would be no coverage unde r Side C (or under any other portion of a 
corporate D&O policy form) for this type of claim. This is beca use Side C applies only to claims 
involving the securities (i.e., shares of stock) the insured co rporation issued.  
On the other hand, assume a situa tion in which a claimant bring s a lawsuit alleging that poor management 
decisions caused the corporation to suffer a quarterly loss. Wi thin 2 days of the announcement of this 
loss, shares of the company’s s tock have dropped in value by 50  percent. Side C of the policy would 
cover such a claim since it i nvolves securities issued by the i nsured company.  
Limits for Entity Coverag e of Securities Claims 
As is the case with Coverage A ( D&O liability) and Coverage B ( corporate reimbursement), entity 
securities coverage is also subject to the policy’s aggregate l imit. Again, it should be emphasized that 
claims in any combination  under any of these four coverag es (A, B, C, D) can exhaust the  policy’s 
aggregate limit. Although the ri se in prevalence of Side C sati sfies an important coverage need for 
insureds, the broader applicati on of coverage can also lead to more rapid depletion of limits. Insureds 
should be sure to make their limits purchasing decisions accord ingly, keeping not only the individual 
directors and officers in mind but also the entity itself. 
Retentions for Entity Coverage 
Typically, however, coverage for securities claims is generally  subject to a separate, larger retention than 
that applicable to Coverage B (co rporate reimbursement) and Cov erage A (direct coverage for directors 
and officers, which is not subject to a retention). Coverage un der Side C of a D&O policy is subject to a 
higher retention because securities claims against corporate en tities are usually much larger than other 
types of claims made under Cove rage B. Additionally, corporatio ns themselves have more assets at their 
disposal, meaning they can tolerate a higher retention.  
Allocation Issues under Entity Securities (“Side C”) Coverage 
One unique aspect of entity securities liability coverage is th at, in a number of instances, claims will be 
made against the entity that 
 are also made against other parties  not covered by the policy (i.e., nondirectors and nonofficers) , 
known as “covered versus uncove red party” allocation, and  
 sometimes involve individual allegations  that the policy does not cove r (i.e., claims not involving 
securities) along with those that do involve securities, which is known as “covered versus 
uncovered claim” allocation.  
In each of these two instances, a n “allocation” or apportionmen t must be made in which the insured and 
the insurer determine the extent to which each of the parties  named in a lawsuit is entitled to 
indemnification from the D&O policy and the extent to which eac h specific type of allegation comprising 
the claim is or is not covered by the D&O policy. 
Covered versus Uncover ed Party Allocation 
Typically, a lawsuit names both individual directors and office rs and the corporat e entity. In cases in 
which entity coverage is not pur chased, the insurer must “alloc ate” or apportion coverage between the 
corporate entity on one hand and the directors and officers on the other. It must, according to the facts 
surrounding the claim, determine which specific allegations per tain to individual directors and officers 
and which result from the acts o f persons whom the policy does not insure (i.e., nondirectors/nonofficers).   
10 Particularly corresponding with the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxl ey Act in 2002 (SOx), insurers have 
added nondirectors/nonofficers w ith high-level responsibilities  as insureds (e.g., corporate comptrollers, 
senior staff attorneys, human resources managers) under Coverag e C. This is because SOx expanded the 
personal liability of such indivi duals, for which coverage is n ow typically required in a large, publicly 
traded corporation. Such a coverage extension has significantly  reduced the number of covered versus 
uncovered party allocation disputes.  
Covered versus Uncov ered Claim Allocation 
Another type of allocation issue arises when some, but not all,  of the allegations comprising a D&O claim 
are covered under a given policy form. For example, a single la wsuit might involve allegations of 
wrongful financial reporting that caused the share price of an insured’s stock to nosedive, combined with 
allegations of damages caused by pollution. In this situation, an allocation would have to be made 
between the damages resulting from the former claim, which woul d be covered under Side C, and the 
latter claim, for which virtua lly all D&O forms exclude coverag e. 
Allocation Provisions in D&O Policies 
Apportionment of an insurer’s payment is extremely complex in b oth covered pers on/uncovered person 
and covered claim/uncovered clai m situations. Usually, the exte nt (i.e., the percentage) to which a claim 
is covered becomes a matter of contentious negotiation between the parent organization and the insurer, 
rather than a function of straight forward application of policy  terms.  
Nevertheless, since disputes frequently result from the allocat ion process, D&O forms contain allocation 
provisions that are aimed at providing guidance as to how the a llocation process will be conducted, in an 
effort to reduce, if not ave rt, such controversies.  
Best Efforts Allocation Provisions 
By far, the most common type of allocation provision in D&O pol icies is known as the “best efforts” 
provision, whereby both insurer and insured promise to use thei r “best efforts” in apportioning covered 
claim amounts, based on the rela tive legal exposures of the par ties and based on the type(s) of claims 
made. In the event they are unable to do so, the insurer promis es to advance what it considers “fair and 
proper” amounts, on the insured’s behalf, prior to resolving th e dispute. In some instances, an arbitrator is 
hired to make an allocation dete rmination, although in most cas es, the insured and insurer are able to 
negotiate allocations between the mselves. (Judges, on the other  hand, do not participate in allocation 
proceedings.) 
Derivative Investigations Coverage  
(“Side D”) 
A derivative claim is a type of lawsuit brought by one or more stockholders—on behalf of the 
corporation—rather than on beha lf of the individual stockholder . The alleged harm must be to the 
corporation as a whole, rather th an to one or more shareholders . Therefore, any recovery in derivative 
suits inures to the benefit of the  corporation and is therefore  paid to the corporation rather than to the 
shareholder(s) who institute the action.  
Derivative investigations associ ated with these claims are a pa rt of an ever-higher proportion of D&O 
claims. When such investigations are called for, insureds must usually hire outside, independent counsel, 
as well as various accounting, financial, and regulatory expert s. Such parties then assist the organization 
in activities such as managing document requests, responding to  interrogatories, and providing 
depositions. 
Accordingly, beginning around 2009, D&O insurers started offeri ng investigations coverage, known as 
“Side D.”  
11 Limitations Associated with Side D Coverage 
There are three specific drawb acks associated with investigatio ns coverage: (1) low limits, (2) lack of 
excess coverage, and (3) na rrow coverage scope. 
Low Limits  
The vast majority of insurers wr ite Side D coverage with only a  $250,000 sublimit. This means that 
payment of investigation costs reduces the policy’s aggregate l imit and is therefore not an additional limit 
of coverage. For example, assume a  D&O policy contains a $5 mil lion aggregate limit. Also assume that 
an insurer pays the full $5 million limit in conjunction with t he defense and indemnity costs of various 
claims made during the policy period. Once the $5 million aggre gate limit is exhauste d, there would be no 
monies available to pay the cos ts associated with investigation s—despite the policy’s $250,000 sublimit. 
Lack of Excess Coverage 
Furthermore, virtually no excess D&O insurers will provide “dro p down” coverage once the $250,000 
sublimit has been exhausted, alt hough there are rare exceptions . For example, assume that an insured 
expends $1.25 million in investig ations expense in conjunction with a claim. Also assume that its primary 
D&O insurer pays the full $250,000 sublimit for such costs. Des pite the fact that the insured has an 
excess D&O policy containing an additional $5 million limit, th e excess insurer will not “drop down” and 
cover the remaining $1 million that the insured did not receive  from its primary D&O insurer (i.e., $1.25 
million total investigation expen se – $250,000 paid by primary D&O insurer = $1 million not covered by 
excess D&O insurer).  
Narrow Coverage Scope  
Nearly all D&O policies’ investigations expense insuring agreem ents state that cove rage is limited to 
shareholder derivative demand i nvestigations. Although the inci dence of derivative claims has grown 
historically, the number of investigations necessitated by deri vative claims is nevertheless dwarfed by 
those conducted at the behest of government regulatory agencies , a type of investigation that is typically 
not covered by “Side D.”

15 Chapter 2 
Covered Acts, Persons, and Organizations under D&O Policies 
Overview 
This chapter examines the cove red acts, covered persons, and co vered organizations provisions found 
within corporate D&O policy forms.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. in any given situation, identify the persons and organizations covered by a corporate D&O policy; 
2. distinguish between acts that a re and are not covered by a D&O policy; and 
3. recognize situations requiring special handling and identify ap propriate methods of handling 
these situations. 
Covered Acts under D&O Policies 
D&O policies contain a two-part  wrongful act definition. The fi rst part pertains to conduct and the second 
to status. Customarily, the def inition encompasses the followin g. 
1. Any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement , act, omission, or breach of duty 
by directors or officers while ac ting in their individual or co llective capacities as directors or 
officers  
2. Any matter claimed against them solely by reason of their being  directors or officers of the 
company  
No Coverage for Bodily Injury (BI) and Property Damage (PD) 
Like most other forms of professional liability insurance (alth ough architects and engineers, medical 
malpractice, and police professi onal liability coverages are no table exceptions), D&O coverage is not 
designed to treat exposures related to BI or PD, an intent refl ected in the “wrongful act” definition in the 
policies. In fact, separate excl usions apply to BI and PD claim s in virtually all D&O policies. Rather, the 
typical covered claims that are made against corporate director s and officers are normally based on 
allegations that decisions, acts, errors, or omissions of the d irectors and officers have lowered the value of 
the company’s stock, compromised the company’s competitive posi tion in the industry, wasted corporate 
assets, caused the company to fo rego a significant opportunity,  or otherwise injured stockholders (or 
others) in an economic or financial sense. 
One common exception, or nuance, to this rule is the affirmativ e coverage for securities claims arising 
out of BI or PD.   
16 No Entity Coverage for Employ ment Practices Liability (EPL) 
The vast majority of public compa ny D&O policy forms have EPL e xclusions that bar entity coverage for 
conduct such as discrimination, w rongful termination, sexual ha rassment, retaliation, or other 
inappropriate employment conduct . Entity coverage for these exp osures is typically found in either stand-
alone EPL policies or some form of management liability package  policy. However, many public 
company D&O liability forms do o ffer coverage for non-entity EP L exposures, such as when individual 
directors and officers are named in an employment-related lawsu it. 
Up until about 2010, a large per centage of private company D&O policies afforded coverage for EPL 
claims, and for this reason, priva te company D&O policies were some of the last to add the EPL 
exclusion. However, given the e ventual widespread addition of t he exclusion, claims made under private 
company D&O policies now involve a much higher percentage of mo re “traditional” D&O claims (i.e., 
those involving economic or financial loss).  
Covered Persons under D&O Policies 
D&O policies are designed to aut omatically cover any person occ upying the position of director or officer 
(while acting in their capacity as such) without requiring that  such individuals be specifically named in 
the policy declarations. (Note: The corporate charter is usuall y the source that deter mines which specific 
positions are designated as “offi cers” within a corporation. A person’s official title can actually be 
misleading as to whether or not they are an officer of a corpor ation. For example, the “chief 
administrator” of a hospital is  virtually always an officer—des pite not having the title of “vice president” 
or “chief executive officer.” On the other hand, the literally hundreds of assistant vice presidents at large, 
national banks are generally not  officers of the corporation, d espite having the title of “vice president.”) 
Coverage Only for Acts as a Director/Officer  
It should be recognized, however, that directors and officers a re covered only for claims that allege 
wrongdoing while acting in the capacity of a director or office r. Where such acts of misconduct were not 
performed in such a capacity, c laims under a D&O policy are not  covered. For instance, often the chief 
counsel or senior legal person in  an organization is also a cor porate officer, and, in some instances, this 
individual sits on the corporation’s board of directors. In the se situations, D&O policies do not cover such 
persons for their acts as attorneys (e.g., for liability incurr ed when drafting a contract or when making a 
court appearance on the organiza tion’s behalf). Rather, such ex posures are addressed by specialized 
policies designed to cover their liabilities incurred as employ ed lawyers, known as “employed lawyers 
professional liability insurance. ” In effect, a D&O policy woul d only cover the organization’s chief 
counsel for acts that would subject nonattorneys to liability ( e.g., voting to approve a merger or 
acquisition at a board meeting).  
“Automatic” Coverage for Newl y Created Directors/Officers 
Almost no insurers mandate that the parent report newly created  director or officer positions. This is 
because D&O premiums are not based upon the number of covered i ndividuals. (D&O premiums are 
more closely correlated with an organization’s total assets, am ong other factors.) Accordingly, coverage 
under D&O forms is said to be “automatic.” 
Coverage for Nondirectors/Nonofficers 
When requested, underwriters w ill normally agree to broaden the  policy to cover corporate managers with 
high-level responsibilities, as well as other types of employee s, despite the fact that they are not 
technically officers (e.g., the corporate assistant treasurer o r human resources manager). Addition of such 
persons as insureds can usually  be accomplished without any add itional premium. Such coverage 
extensions require that these nonofficers be reported to the un derwriter. In some organizations, such as 
hospitals, officer positions are not always denoted by the term  “vice president.” Thus , a person who is, in  
17 effect, the chief executive officer of a hospital may have the title “chief administrator.” Under these 
circumstances, insureds should be sure that the policy lists, i n the declarations, the person or persons for 
whom coverage is intended to apply. 
Coverage of Nondirectors/Nonoffi cers for Securities Claims 
As noted earlier, a number of i nsurers have added nondirectors/ nonofficers as insureds, although only for 
securities claims. The need to add such persons as insureds ste ms from the fact that under SOx, in 
addition to directors and officers, in-house accounting and leg al personnel (e.g., auditors, staff attorneys) 
also can be held liable for a number of wrongful acts, the natu re of which is sometimes asserted in 
lawsuits, most often in those involving securities. For this re ason, an increasing number of insurers are 
adding coverage for nondirectors/ officers when they are named i n securities-related lawsuits.  
Coverage of Past, Present, and Future Directors and Officers 
The policies intend to cover persons (only while acting in thei r capacity as directors or officers) who 
 served as directors and officers in the past,  
 currently serve, or  
 will serve in the future.  
Coverage of Past/Retired Directors 
Coverage of past personnel is important because claims are rout inely made against individuals after they 
have left the company but who were directors and officers at th e time of an alleged wrongful act. Such 
coverage also ensures the full cooperation of these individuals  in defending a claim, which might not be 
the case if they were not insureds under the policy. 
Coverage of Future Directors 
By covering future directors and officers, it is made clear tha t the insurance is not limited only to those 
holding director and officer positions at the inception of the policy period. This is significant because a 
claim may be made against an individual director or officer aft er he or she assumes such a position but 
before the parent organization has had an opportunity to notify  the underwriter to this effect. One final 
important point: coverage of ne w directors requires no notifica tion to the insurer within any specific time 
frame during the policy (other than notification by means of th eir inclusion within a renewal application).  
Coverage of Subsidiary Directors and Officers  
D&O liability policies cover individual directors and officers at a number of corporate levels. 
Accordingly, coverage automatic ally applies to directors and of ficers of 
 the parent company;  
 existing, majority-owned subsidiaries of the parent company; an d  
 newly created/acquired subsidiaries of the parent.  
Directors and officers of the parent company and existing subsi diaries are automatically covered at the 
inception of the policy. This is  because the application normal ly includes underwriting data pertinent to 
these individuals, and the premium quoted reflects the exposure  they generate. 
Typically, policies define the t erm “subsidiary” as an entity i n which the parent company owns more than 
50 percent of the outstanding voting stock. However, a few poli cies contain somewhat more liberal 
definitions of “subsidiary” and broaden the term to include cor porations in which a subsidiary or any 
entity of the parent company owns  100 percent of the voting sto ck (even if the parent corporation does not 
hold a majority interest in the subsidiary).  
18 Coverage of Directors and Officers of Foreign Subsidiaries 
The directors and officers of a corporation’s foreign subsidiar ies do not always have the title of “director” 
or “officer,” despite the fact that their duties, responsibilit ies, and legal liability exposures are similar, if 
not identical, to their US counterparts. Accordingly, D&O polic y “insured persons” definitions sometimes 
provide coverage of such individuals who function as directors and officers but whose official titles may 
not be “director” or “officer.” Organizations with foreign pers onnel who fall within this category should 
have their D&O policies endorsed  accordingly if the policy’s de finition of “insured persons” does not 
afford such coverage (under wha t is known as a “foreign functio nal equivalents” provision).  
Coverage of Estates, Heirs, and Legal Representatives 
Virtually all of the policies also cover the estates, heirs, an d legal representatives of insureds. A D&O 
claim is a claim against the p ersonal assets of the individual directors and officers; therefore, such 
protection will be transferred to the insured’s heirs, estates,  or trustees if he or she dies, is declared 
incompetent, or files for bankruptcy. 
Spousal Coverage 
Insured directors and officers sometimes attempt to shield asse ts from potential D&O claim judgments by 
transferring those assets to the ir spouses. To counter this tac tic, plaintiffs’ attorneys name spouses in suit 
papers. Therefore, spouses also require protection under the D& O form, and insurers have responded to 
this need by extending insured s tatus to the spouses and often significant others of insured directors and 
officers. 
Coverage Applies to Spousal S tatus, Not to Spousal Acts 
It is important to note, however, that spousal coverage does no t extend protection for the wrongful act of a 
spouse of an insured director or officer; rather, such provisio ns only cover that spouse’s liability as a 
spouse of an insured or because the spouse shares interest in p roperty of an insured director or officer. 
Thus, there would be no coverage  of a spouse who is not a direc tor or officer if he or she were accused of 
fraud. Coverage would only apply to the nondirector/nonofficer spouse if such an allegation were also 
made against the spouse (for his or her corporate wrongdoing) w ho is a director or officer.  
Spousal Coverage Definition Tha t Includes “Domestic Partners” 
An increasing percentage of insurers’ forms contain a spousal c overage definition that covers “... spouses, 
including ‘domestic partners.’” (A domestic partnership is a le gal or personal relationship between two 
individuals who live together a nd share a common domestic life but are joined by neither a traditional 
marriage nor a civil union.) Given  the increased incidence of s uch living arrangements, the need to 
provide this coverage extension has grown over time. Preferred wording, which provides the broadest 
possible scope of coverage, defin es a domestic partner as a per son qualifying as such “... under any 
applicable law of any jurisdiction in the world, or by common o r statutory law.” 
Virtually all insurers cover spou ses within their regular defin ition of “insured persons,” meaning that a 
separate endorsement is not necess ary for spousal coverage. 
Coverage of Directors and Offi cers for Outside Activities  
Recognizing that corporate directors and officers also sometime s serve on the boards of other 
organizations, D&O policy forms usually contain provisions desi gned to provide coverage for these 
situations, typically in provisi ons termed “outside position ma nagement liability” coverage. It is 
important to mention that this provision typically applies only  when service on such boards is at the 
direction of the parent organi zation, although this is not alwa ys the case. So, for example, there would be 
no coverage for a director who s its on the board of his condomi nium association. Rather, the intent of  
19 such provisions is to cover directors and officers who serve on  nonprofit boards, usually as 
“representatives” of the for-pro fit corporation on whose board they also serve.  
Under the minority of forms tha t do not cover the exposure from  service on outside, nonprofit boards 
automatically, such coverage can  usually be obtained by endorse ment.  
No Coverage for For-Profit Board Service 
Coverage for service on outside boards only applies to nonprofi t boards of directors. Coverage for an 
insured’s service on for-profit boards is never provided under D&O policies. This is because service on 
for-profit boards generates si gnificantly greater exposure to c laim frequency and sev erity compared to 
service on nonprofit boards. 
Triple Excess Cove rage Application 
When it applies, outside directorship liability coverage does s o only on an excess basis. Specifically, such 
coverage is afforded excess of 
1. any insurance coverage proceeds a fforded to the director from t he outside entity’s D&O policy;  
2. any indemnification the outside entity provides to the director ; and  
3. any indemnification provided by the parent organization (i.e., the organization covered by the 
D&O policy that affords ou tside position coverage).  
“Double” versus “Triple” Excess Coverage 
Most D&O forms provide outside d irectorship coverage only after  conditions 1 and 2 above have been 
satisfied, known as “double excess” coverage. However, there ar e some forms that provide such coverage 
only after all three conditions  above have been satisfied, know n as “triple excess” coverage. 
From a practical standpoint, the  outside position coverage desc ribed above is of relatively little value. 
This is especially true when pro vided on a “triple excess basis .” Consider the following scenario. The 
CEO of Company A serves on the board of nonprofit Company B. Co mpany A’s policy provides outside 
directorship liability coverage  on a triple excess basis. Befor e the CEO can receive any proceeds under 
A’s policy, the following three events would first have to tran spire.  
 Company B’s policy limits would ha ve to be exhausted (or covera ge not apply);  
 Company B would be unable to indemnify the CEO (most likely, du e to insolvency); and  
 Company A would be unable to indemnify the CEO, again, most lik ely due to its own insolvency.  
Even if coverage were written on a double excess basis, the fir st two conditions (above) would have to 
occur. Accordingly, outside directorship liability coverage is usually of little practical value. This is 
especially true in the (increasingly uncommon) scenario that an  insured is covered on a “triple excess 
basis.”  
Covered Organizations under D&O Policies 
D&O policies cover a corporation’ s individual directors and off icers (Side A) as well as the 
organization’s obligation to inde mnify these individuals (Side B). The organization is usually termed the 
“parent company” under the policy, although, technically, it is  not an insured under a D&O form unless 
the policy also provides entit y securities liability coverage ( Side C).  
   
20 Coverage of Newly Created/Acquired Entities 
The scope of coverage for the directors and officers of newly c reated or acquired entities has liberalized 
significantly over time. Previous ly, most insurers required not ification within 30 to 60 days of 
acquisition/creation and submission of underwriting data, somet imes imposed covera ge restrictions, and 
frequently charged additional prem ium. Currently, many insurers  afford automatic coverage (i.e., 
notification not required) if the subsidiary’s assets do not ex ceed 10 to 25 percent (depending on the 
individual insurer) of the paren t company’s assets. When an ent ity is acquired with assets exceeding 25 
percent of the parent organization, underwriters generally requ ire notification within 60 days, as well as 
additional premium, to reflect the increased exposure created b y the acquisition. (Absent notification in 
such instances, no coverage will apply to the new entity.) In c ontrast, when a new entity falls below the 
policy’s stated asset threshold, no notice is required, other t han including the new entity in details 
provided with the corporation’s next renewal application. 
Coverage Only Applies to Post-Acquisition/Creation Acts 
An important aspect of this provision is that coverage only app lies to wrongful acts that took place after 
acquisition or creation of the n ew entity. For the policy to co ver acts that took place before the 
acquisition/creation, additional premium is always required. In  effect, the automatic nature of the 
coverage provided by this provi sion does not apply to “prior ac ts.” 
This concept is illustrate d below in Exhibit 2.1. 
Exhibit 2.1  
Application of Coverage for Pre- and Post-Acquisition Acts  
 
  
 
21 Automatic Coverage Termination Provisions in Largescale 
Mergers/Consolidations 
Virtually all D&O policies include  provisions that immediately turn the policy into “runoff” coverage 
until the expiration date in the event another company acquires  the majority of the insured organization’s 
assets. This allows the insured to report claims for a given am ount of time in the event of a merger or 
consolidation. Provisions of this  kind override the normal canc ellation notice requirements discussed later 
in this section of the course.  
Coverage Excluded for Wrongful  Acts after the Acquisition 
These provisions preclude coverage  for wrongful acts taking pla ce after the date of acquisition, which, in 
theory, is not a problem. This is because coverage should only be required in conjunction with the 
wrongful acts that took place before the organization ceased to  exist. For example, Organization B 
acquires Organization A, whose D&O policy term is January 1, 20 20–2021, on October 1, 2020. 
Organization A’s D&O coverage under the policy automatically te rminates with respect to claims from 
any wrongful act that takes place after  that date. Accordingly, howev er, A will still have coverage fo r 
wrongful acts that took place prior  to that date, as long as they are  made against the insured and  reported 
to the insurer prior to the end of its current policy period (J anuary 1, 2020–2021). Thus, cancellation of 
coverage applies only to acts th at take place after the acquisi tion but not to claims made against the 
insured and reported to the ins urer prior to January 1, 2021. I n effect, the insured will have extended 
reporting coverage (a concept discussed in Chapter 9 of this co urse) as to any acts that took place prior to 
October 1, 2020, and are reported to the insur er prior to January 1, 2021. 
As to acts taking place after the acquisition, Organization A w ill presumably have coverage under 
Organization B’s D&O policy. 
These concepts are illustrate d below in Exhibit 2.2. 
Exhibit 2.2  
Application of Change of Control Provision  
When Acquired Company’s Policy Is Canceled  
Company A acquired Company B on June 1, 2020, at which time B’s  policy was automatically 
canceled. A claim is made agains t B on September 1, 2020, that arose from a wrongf ul act that took 
place on March 1, 2020, and is a lso reported to the insurer on that date. Coverage applies to this 
claim under B’s policy because t he wrongful act that gave rise to the claim took place during the 
term of B’s policy (March 1, 2020–2021) and before the policy w as canceled. Thi s is illustrated 
below. 
 
Activating a Discovery Provision 
Another means to obtain coverage  of acts prior to an acquisitio n would be for the acquired company to 
activate its D&O policy’s discovery provision (also known as an  “awareness clause” or “notice of 
potential claim provision,” discussed in more detail in Chapter  9 of this course). Under a discovery 
provision, coverage will be afforded for any incidents or circu mstances that could give rise to a claim 
(regardless of how far in the future such claims are actually m ade against the insured), provided the 
insurer is notified of such incidents prior to policy terminati on.

23 Answers to Chapter 2 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Covera ge applies only to Alice’s acts  as a corporate officer. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. Alice may perform business-related ac ts that have nothing to do with her 
role as a corporate officer. 
C. That’s correct! Directors and officers are automatically covere d for claims that allege wrongdoing 
while acting in the capacity  of a director or officer. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Alice is a covered person. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. D&O po licies are designed to automati cally cover any person occupying 
the position of director or officer. 
B. That’s correct! Deceased directors  and officers are no longer s ubject to D&O claims. Many 
policies do, however, cover the e states, heirs, and legal repre sentatives of insureds. 
C. This answer is incorrect. D&O policies intend to cover persons who served as directors and 
officers in the past. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Directors and officers need not be id entified by name for coverage to 
apply; moreover, automatic coverage applies to newly created D& O positions. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. An exc lusion would pr eclude, not prov ide, coverage. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The issue is not where coverage appli es (territorially) but to whom it 
applies. 
C. That’s correct! A foreign functional equivalents provision prov ides coverage to foreign personnel 
who have officers’ duties and ex posures if not officer titles. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Waving the flag of the country one re sides in may be a smart move, but 
this is not something referred t o in the definitions of a D&O p olicy. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Underwriters frequently charge an add itional premium. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Child’s  assets are too large to quali fy Child for automatic coverage. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The underwriter should be notified wi thin the time frame specified in the 
policy. 
D. That’s correct! When an entity is  acquired with assets exceedin g 25 percent of the parent 
organization, underwriters generally require notification withi n 60 days, as well as additional 
premium, to reflect the increas ed exposure created by the acqui sition. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Only one policy applies. 
B. This answer is incorrect. When  the wrongful act  occurred, Paper ’s policy did not cover Rock. 
C. That’s correct! The wrongful act took place during the term of Rock’s policy and before the policy

24 Chapter 3 
Two Key Definitions: “Claim” and “Damages” 
Overview 
This chapter analyzes two key de finitions included within publi c company D&O policies: “claim” and 
“damages.”  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. recognize the types of events that trigger a “claim” under a ty pical D&O policy, 
2. recognize why a broad definition of “claim” is desirable,  
3. identify the types of damages covered and not covered by a D&O policy, and 
4. recognize the purpose of “most favorable jurisdiction” provisio ns. 
Definition of “Claim” 
The manner in which the policies define the term “claim” is an important coverage issue. The broadest 
possible definition is ideal b ecause such a definition tends to  accelerate the trigger of coverage under a 
D&O policy form, which is usually advantageous from the insured ’s standpoint. Although the exact 
definitions of “claim” vary from policy to policy, the followin g are events that trigger a “claim” under the 
typical D&O policy. 
Civil Proceeding Commenced by the Service of a Complaint 
A civil proceeding commenced by th e service of a complaint is a ctually a type of written demand for 
monetary or nonmonetary relief. 
Criminal Proceeding Commenced by an Indictment 
A criminal indictment also tri ggers coverage under a D&O policy . This is important because, at times, 
corporate directors and officers are indicted for criminal offe nses, prior to the time in which civil 
complaints are filed against them. (Note: The policies exclude coverage for damages alleged in 
conjunction with criminal acts. H owever, the policies state tha t defense coverage is provided when an 
insured is criminally charged a nd that defense coverage continu es until “final adjudication,” meaning the 
point at which the insured director/officer is acquitted, convi cted, or pleads guilty, or the claim is settled.)  
Administrative or Arbitration Pro ceeding Against Any Insured Person 
Administrative or regulatory agencies frequently file complaint s against directors and officers; thus, it is 
important for such actions to tr igger coverage. In addition, re quests for arbitration are brought against 
insureds, often under the terms o f a D&O policy, usually in the  event of a coverage dispute. (This issue  
25 will be addressed in more detail under the heading of “Arbitrat ion Provisions,” discussed in Chapter 7 of 
this course.) 
Civil, Criminal, Administrative,  or Regulatory Investigations 
Corporate directors and officers frequently find themselves the  target of investigations, in addition to 
having actual claims made against them. Accordingly, it is impo rtant that such actions also fall within a 
D&O policy’s definition of “claim.” For example, in 2015, the S ecurities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) cited 112 accounting and aud iting enforcement actions, sh owing the extent of investigatory-type 
action.  
Request for Extradition or Arrest  Warrant for any Insured Person 
Occasionally, legal authorities seek the extradition of a corpo rate director or officer from a foreign 
country. Under some, but not all, p olicy forms, such actions fa ll within their definitions of “claim.” 
Not all of the foregoing elemen ts are contained in all D&O poli cy definitions of the term “claim,” 
especially the last element, that for extradition requests. How ever, the broader the scope of the definition 
of “claim” is, the more adva ntageous for the insured.  
Covered Damages/Covered Losses under D&O Policies 
D&O policies cover amounts paid as (1) judgments or settlements  and (2) expenses incurred in defending 
or settling an action against th e insured directors and officer s or covered entity. (T he coverage provided 
by a D&O policy in connection with the defense of suits will be  analyzed in Chapter 5 of this course.) 
Items Excluded from “Covered Damages” Definition 
The following items generally do not fall within the typical D& O policy’s definition of “covered 
damages” or “covered losses”: (1) sanctions, (2) taxes, (3) fin es, (4) penalties, and (5) matters deemed 
uninsurable under the law where a D&O claim is made (which usua lly refers to coverage of punitive 
damages in jurisdictions where p ayment of punitive damages by i nsurance policies is not permitted). This 
means that even though a company’ s indemnification agreement pe rmits it to reimburse directors and 
officers for certain types of damages awarded in conjunction wi th claims against th em (such as punitive 
damages), the policy does not cover the “items excluded” portio n of the company’s indemnification 
obligation.  
“Covered Damages” Limited to P ayment of Monetary Damages 
Standard definitions of “covered damages” and “covered loss” al so preclude coverage for injunctive 
relief, which refers to court or ders to perform certain actions  or to desist from certain actions (e.g., a court 
may order a corporation to surrender a piece of land to another  corporation or individual to whom the 
court has ruled the land rightfully belongs). In effect, the de finitions of “covered damages” or “covered 
loss” are limited to the payment of monetary damages. 
Coverage of Punitive Damages 
Until the mid-1990s, punitive damag es were almost universally e xcluded from coverage under D&O 
policy forms. There were a number of reasons for this exclusion , one being that reinsurers would not 
cover punitive damages. In additio n, some insurers felt that af fording punitive damages coverage defeated 
their purpose. Since punitive damag es were intended to punish a n insured for uncommonly egregious 
conduct, offering insurance covera ge allowed an insured to “esc ape” such punishment (although coverage 
for punitive damages could, in some instances, be obtained by e ndorsement and usually required payment 
of significant additional premium).   
26 However, In January 1995, Executive Re Indemnity introduced a p olicy containing a definition of the 
term “loss” that afforded an affi rmative grant of coverage for punitive damages, and, s hortly thereafter, a 
number of other insurers began to do likewise. Since that time,  nearly all D&O policy forms provide 
coverage of punitive damages by wa y of most favorable jurisdict ion provisions, to be discussed in more 
detail below.  
State-Specific Prohibitions  of Punitive Damages Coverage 
Despite provisions granting pun itive damages coverage, a number  of states, including California, New 
York, Florida, Pennsylvania, and others, prohibit insurance cov erage of punitive damages. Accordingly, 
even if a D&O policy does not exclude, or even affirmatively co vers, punitive damages, these state-
specific prohibitions can bar pay ment of punitive damages. (Not e: Policies written in these states do not 
contain endorsements barring cove rage of punitive damages. Howe ver, given the laws in these 
jurisdictions, if the insured were to insist upon payment of pu nitive damages, the i nsurer could legally 
refuse to cover such damages, and the insurer’s coverage denial  would probably be sustained in the 
applicable state court.)  
Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions 
Insurers have attempted to cir cumvent these state-specific proh ibitions against coverage of punitive 
damages by means of what are known as “most favorable jurisdict ion” provisions. Nearly all D&O policy 
forms are written with such a provision. To a great extent, ins urers’ willingness to cover punitive 
damages, despite state-specifi c prohibitions, arose from intens e competition in the D&O market 
beginning in the late 1990s and continuing to this day.  
Most favorable jurisdiction wo rding states that, with respect t o the insurability of punitive damages, the 
law of the jurisdiction most fa vorable to the insurability of p unitive damages will apply, provided the 
jurisdiction has a “substantial relationship” with the insured,  with the insurer, or to the location where the 
claim is made or occurs. The “s ubstantial relationship” criteri on is considered to be met by one of the 
following: (1) the jurisdiction where the claim for punitive da mages was made, (2) the jurisdiction where 
the act giving rise to the punitiv e damages award occurred, (3)  the jurisdiction where the insured is 
incorporated or maintains its p rincipal place of business, or ( 4) the jurisdiction where the insurer is 
incorporated or maintains its  principal place of business.  
Two Critical Caveats 
First, it is important to rec ognize that most favorable venue w ording merely modifies the existing level of 
coverage for punitive damages al ready provided by a D&O policy;  it does not provide such coverage if 
punitive damages are otherwise ex cluded by a policy form. Never theless, if a D&O policy is written with 
punitive damages coverage, an e ndorsement providing most favora ble venue wording should, of course, 
be requested, if wording of this kind is not already contained within the policy.  
Second, the enforceability of most favorable jurisdiction wordi ng has never been tested in court. 
Therefore, if an insured requests such an endorsement, no addit ional premium should be charged, because 
the actual value of the endorse ment may be nil until its legali ty is tested in court. 
When the Endorsement Is Important 
Most favorable jurisdiction wording is imperative for the insur ed when purchasing a D&O policy 
 in a state where punitive damages are not insurable and/or  
 for insureds that have multist ate operations and that therefore  cannot predict where the claims 
seeking punitive damages will be b rought against the insured.  
27 Chapter 3 Review Questions 
1. On reviewing his corporation’s directors and officers policy, B ert Dill is alarmed by the wide 
range of potential incidents that appear to qualify as claims. In discussing this concern with Ted, 
the firm’s insurance agent, Bert learns that 
A. a broad definition of “claim” creates problems, because minor i ncidents that fit the 
definition often go unreported. 
B. a broad definition of “claim” is desirable from the firm’s stan dpoint, because it means the 
policy covers a broad range of incidents. 
C. the narrower the definition of c laim, the broader the coverage.  
D. the narrower the definition of “claim,” the more expensive the coverage. 
2. Harry Buns, famous owner of a st ring of indoor tennis courts, h as just been indicted on 
racketeering charges. It is expected that civil complaints will  soon be filed. Under the terms of 
Harry’s typical directors and officers (D&O) policy, his insure r will provide defense coverage 
A. for damages in connection with Harry’s alleged criminal acts. 
B. from the date a civil complaint is filed until the civil claim is settled. 
C. from the date of the indictment until final adjudication. 
D. only if Harry pleads guilty to the criminal charges. 
3. Why is it important to an insured corporation’s directors and o fficers that their directors and 
officers (D&O) policy include investigations within the policy’ s definition of “claim”? 
A. A claim usually leads to an investigation. 
B. A more restrictive definition pos tpones the coverage trigger. 
C. Corporate directors and officers frequently find themselves the  target of investigations. 
D. In almost all cases, an investigation leads to an actual claim.  
4. A claim against the directors and officers of Worst National Ba nk (WNB), who were accused of 
abusive lending practices, is se ttled when the bank agrees to t ake the following actions. Which of 
these actions does WNB’s director s and officers insurance most likely cover? 
A. WNB will cease to overcharge future borrowers. 
B. WNB will issue a public apology. 
C. WNB will pay damages to borro wers who were overcharged. 
D. WNB will return property that was wrongfully seized in settleme nt of a debt. 
   
28 5. “Our Business Is Picking Up” Waste Disposal Company (OBPU) is b ased in Pennsylvania, one 
of the states that prohibits i nsurance coverage of punitive dam ages, and it operates in a 
neighboring state that has no such prohibition. To improve the probability that any directors and 
officers (D&O) judgment for punitiv e damages will be paid, the insurer agrees to add a most 
favorable jurisdiction endorsemen t to OBPU’s policy. The most a ppropriate charge for this 
endorsement is 
A. $0. 
B. 10 percent of the normal D&O premium. 
C. twice the normal D&O premium. 
D. set by the states.  
29 Answers to Chapter 3 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is inco rrect. A broad definition is desirable. 
B. That’s correct! A broad definition results in fewer uncovered i ncidents. 
C. This answer is incorrect . The opposite is true. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Because a narrower definition encompa sses fewer incidents, if anything, 
it deserves a lower premium. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. D&O policies exclude coverage for dam ages alleged in conjunction with 
criminal acts. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Coverage in this case begins even bef ore the civil complaint is filed. 
C. That’s correct! A criminal indictment triggers defense coverage  under a D&O policy, and defense 
coverage continues until final adjudication. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Any defense coverage that is provided  will terminate at the point when 
Harry enters a guilty plea. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. An inve stigation may also lead to a c laim. 
B. This answer is incorrect. It is generally advantageous from the  insured’s standpoint to accelerate 
the coverage trigger. 
C. That’s correct! Because corporat e directors and officers freque ntly find themselves the target of 
investigations, in addition to having actual claims filed again st them, it is important that 
investigative actions also fall within a D&O policy’s definitio n of “claim.” 
D. This answer is incorrect. A director or officer may be the targ et of an investigation that never leads 
to an actual claim. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorr ect. This action requires no financial pay ment. 
B. This answer is incorrect. No money changes hands in this case. 
C. That’s correct! WNB will pay dama ges to borrowers who were over charged. Covered damages or 
covered loss refers to the payment of monetary damages. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Covera ge is limited to the payment of  money damages. 
5.  
A. That’s correct! The actual value of the endorsement may be nil until its legality is tested in court. 
B. This answer is incorrect. That’s  too high a charge for a provis ion that might not even be 
enforceable. 
C. This answer is incorrect. An endorsement that merely modifies t he existing level of coverage 
should not require twi ce the normal premium. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. The states determi ne whether punitive  damages may be covered, but 
insurers set the rates for coverage.

Defense Coverage within D&O Policies 
Overview 
This chapter examines the distin ct nature and operation of defe nse coverage provisions and procedures 
contained within corporate D&O policies.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. identify the items a D&O policy includes as covered defense cos ts, 
2. identify the party(ies) responsible for defense costs under var ious scenarios, and 
3. recognize the implications of dut y to defend versus non-duty to  defend policy language. 
Covered Defense Cost Items 
D&O policies are very similar regarding the types of items incl uded within the definition of “covered 
defense costs.” Essentially, the policies cover attorney fees a nd investigation expenses required to defend 
and settle claims, as well as the  costs of bonds (e.g., appeal and attachment bonds) associated with the 
litigation process.  
Salaries of Insureds Are Not Considered “Covered Defense Costs” 
The most notable component that the policies specifically exclu de from the definition of “covered defense 
costs,” however, is the salaries of directors, officers, and em ployees of the parent organization. In other 
words, the policy does not reimburse the parent corporation for  the salaries of the directors and officers 
who are required to spend time working with defense counsel to adjudicate or settle claims. Given the 
high compensation levels character istic of insureds under D&O p olicies, uninsured compensation losses 
can be substantial. This is especi ally true considering the com plex and time-consuming nature of D&O 
claims.  
Duty To Advance Defense Costs 
Historically, D&O policies did not contain language requiring t he insurer to reimburse the parent 
organization for defense costs until a claim had been completel y resolved. However, given the substantial 
expense entailed in defending cl aims, even large, well-capitali zed organizations would prefer to finance 
the defense of a D&O claim with some degree of insurer assistan ce. Consequently, nearly all D&O forms 
contain language making it a duty for the insurer to advance or  at least reimburse defense costs as they are 
incurred.  
Duty to advance defense cost provisions typically provide that (1) prior to advancement of such costs, the 
policy’s retention must be satisfi ed; (2) any costs advanced to  the insured will reduce policy limits; and 
(3) if it is ultimately determined that the insurer has no liab ility under the policy for the applicable claim, 
insureds are required to repay t he insurer all defense costs th at were advanced.  
31 Recoupment of Uncovered Defense Costs 
Where the insurer has advanced d efense costs, and where the ins urer has provided a defense, the issue 
that often arises is whether the  insurer is entitled to partial ly or completely recoup  its defense costs from 
the insureds—if it turns out that  one or all of the claims were  not, in fact, covered by the policy. An 
example of this would be a situation in which an insured direct or or officer is found guilty of having 
committed fraud in a criminal trial (acts typically excluded un der D&O policies) and the insurer then 
seeks a return of the monies expe nded to defend the insured.  
Almost all policies are silent as to whether an insurer is allo wed to recoup uncovered defense costs that it 
has already paid on an insured’s  behalf. Accordingly, any provi sions allowing the insurer to recoup such 
costs from the insured should b e vigorously resisted. They obvi ously not only are detrimental for an 
insured but also are unusual and should be objected to on that basis, as well.  
Barring the Insurer from Enforcing Recoupment 
Ideally, wording in a D&O policy would state that the insurer i s barred  from seeking such 
reimbursement. Of course, this is  a favorable approach for the insured. Although it is difficult to negotiate 
a provision barring an insurer from seeking recoupment of nonco vered defense costs, attempts should be 
made to do so nonetheless.  
Common Law Right of Recoupment: The Majority Rule 
It appears that a majority of jurisdictions allow insurers to r ecoup uncovered defense costs even in the 
absence of language to that effect in the policy, especially wh ere the insurer expressly reserves its right to 
seek such recoupment in an agreem ent made prior to advancing th e defense costs. They reason that, if the 
insured does not object to the insurer’s reservation of rights in that regard, the insured must have 
consented to the insurer’s right  to be repaid if the claims tur n out to be not covered. 
Some D&O policies now contain express provisions requiring the insureds to repay defense costs if a 
court decides that any part of t hem were not covered. The D&O p olicy at issue in Protection Strategies, 
Inc. v. Starr Indem.& Liab. Co.,  (Fourth Circuit US Court of Appeals, May 27, 2015) provides an  
example of such a reimbursement provision. 
[i]n the event and to the extent that the Insureds shall not be  entitled to payment of such 
Loss under the terms and conditions of this policy, such paymen ts by the Insurer shall be 
repaid to the Insurer  by the Insureds. [As cited by  Leagle, Inc., emphasis added.] 
No Common Law Right of Rec oupment: The Minority Rule 
A growing number of jurisdictions disagree with the majority ru le. They read the insurer’s duty to provide 
a defense to be more absolute. T hey hold that, absent language in the policy itself  explicitly granting the 
insurer a right of recoupment, the insured is not required to r epay defense costs even where the insurer 
provides a defense to the claim under a reservation of rights l etter. 
Duty To Defend versus Non- Duty To Defend Language 
D&O policies for larger, more le galistically sophisticated insu red organizations are  most often written on 
a “non-duty to defend” (also somet imes called a “duty to pay”) basis. In contrast, smaller insureds that do 
not have the experience or time to become closely involved in t he complexities of D&O litigation 
generally opt for what are known as “duty to defend” policies. Insureds can usually choose between a 
“duty to defend” and a “non-duty to defend”/“duty to pay” form.  Almost all nonprofit and private 
company policies are written on a duty to defend basis, while t he vast majority of public company 
policies are written on a non-duty to defend basis.  
32 The phrase “duty to defend” in a D&O policy expressly states th at the insurer has the duty to defend any 
claim alleging a covered act under the policy. In contrast, oth er policies state that the insurer has “no duty 
to defend” the insured; rather, such forms indicate that “it is  the duty of the insured to defend claims.” 
Such forms only compel the insurer to pay the defense costs in connection with the insured’s executing 
the defense of the claims. 
Who Controls Defense and Settlement? 
Two of the important differenc es between a “non-duty to defend”  and a “duty to defend” policy involve 
(1) the right to choose defense counsel and (2) the right to co ntrol the defense of the claim. Under a “duty 
to defend” policy, unless specifi cally negotiated otherwise in the policy, the insurer has the right to 
choose defense counsel. In additio n, under a “duty to defend” p olicy, the insurer typically has the 
absolute, unfettered right to control the defense strategy of t he claim, including settlement.  
Conversely, under a “non-duty to defend” policy, the insured is  able to use any lawyer of its choice, 
subject to insurer approval (alt hough the consent to settlement  provisions of such policies state that 
approval will not be “unreasonabl y withheld”). In addition, the  policyholder has the right to control the 
defense strategy and settlement of the claim. Accordingly, the policyholder would, for example, have the 
option of settling a claim (although it typically may not settl e without first obtaining the insurer’s consent; 
again, the policies state that such consent will not be “unreas onably withheld”) or, on the other hand, 
taking it to trial.  
Pros and Cons of Duty To Defend versus Duty To Pay Policies 
In many instances, a duty to defend provision may benefit an in sured, despite the fact that the provision 
reduces the extent to which the insured can exert control over the claims handling process. This is 
especially true if the company is inexperienced in managing the  complexities of D&O litigation. On the 
other hand, firms that are more  familiar with the details of th e D&O claims handling process may prefer a 
D&O policy containing duty to pa y/non-duty to defend language. (This is also true because there is 
typically no difference in cost between these two kinds of poli cies.) In short, the selection of duty to 
defend/non-duty to defend language is an organization-specific issue.  
One significant benefit of duty to defend forms, as opposed to non-duty to defend policies, is availability 
of so-called all-allegations def ense coverage under the former.  Under a duty to defend policy, the insurer 
is obligated to defend all of the allegations in a lawsuit, as long as the policy covers a t least one such 
allegation.  
The following scenario illustrates this point. A former employe e with 20 years of service is terminated by 
Company A immediately after the company imposes a widespread la yoff. The layoff was precipitated by 
the fact that Company A has ju st purchased a competitor, Compan y B, resulting in a duplication of staff. 
Consequently, 10 percent of both companies’ workforces are let go. The former employee, who also holds 
a significant amount of Company A stock, brings a lawsuit again st A, alleging that (1) Company A paid 
too much for Company B, thus dim inishing the value of her share s of stock in Company A; and (2) 
Company A illegally terminated her. 
Although both damages and defense costs arising from the first allegation are covered by a standard D&O 
policy form (under Coverage C, because the claim involves the s ecurities of the company) the wrongful 
termination allegation is excl uded. However, under a duty to de fend policy, since coverage exists for the 
first allegation, the insurer must also defend the wrongful ter mination claim (although it would not be 
liable for any potential damages associated with it). In contra st, under a non-duty to defend policy, the 
insurer would only be obligated to pay the costs of defending ( and indemnifying) the insured for the first 
but not the second allegation.  
33 Defense Procedures under Non-Duty To Defend Forms 
Despite the fact that a policy is written on a non-duty to defe nd basis, a D&O insurer does, however, 
retain a certain amount of cont rol over the handling of suits b rought against its insureds. For instance, 
almost all of the policies cont ain what are known as cooperatio n clauses, which give the insurer the right 
to associate with the parent comp any and insured directors and officers in defending and negotiating the 
settlement of claims, even when  those policies are written on a  non-duty to defend basis.  
However, under non-duty to defend policies, if the insured is a ble to settle a claim within the policy’s 
retention, no insurer consent is  generally required. In additio n, the policies require insureds to provide the 
insurer with ongoing information concerning the details of the settlement process.

34 Chapter 4 Review Questions 
1. Timeless Watch Company’s directors and officers (D&O) policy ha d a $1 million limit and a 
$100,000 retention when it was presented with a D&O claim for w hich the policy appeared to 
provide coverage. Once Timeless’ s legal bills exceeded $100,000 , the insurer advanced additional 
funds to support further defense costs. The insurer had advance d $75,000 in defense costs before 
it became clear that the insurer had no liability for this part icular claim under the terms of its 
policy. What happens to the mone y spent on Timeless’s defense? 
A. The insurer will give Timeless an  additional $100,000 to reimbu rse the retention amount. 
B. Timeless must return $75,000 to the insurer. 
C. Timeless must return $100,000 to the insurer. 
D. Timeless will keep the $75,000 an d use it to pay defense costs in excess of the retention. 
2. Robert is concerned what might  happen if an insurer unsuccessfu lly defends claims against a 
director that ultimately turn out to involve criminal acts or s ome other activity not covered by the 
directors and officers (D&O) policy. Robert is afraid the insur er would then seek to recover its 
defense costs from the corporati on. In such a situation, the mo st favorable wording in a D&O 
policy would 
A. allow the insurer to recoup uncovered defense costs. 
B. bar the insurer from seeking reimbursement. 
C. be silent as to whether the ins urer can seek reimbursement. 
D. require the insurer to seek reimbursement. 
3. Selfie Camera Company has a directors and officers (D&O) policy  with duty to defend language, 
which specifies who has the right  to choose defense counsel and  the right to control the defense 
of the claim. Therefore, if Selfie faces a D&O claim, 
A. Selfie will choose the defense counsel and control the defense of the claim. 
B. Selfie will choose the defense counsel, and the insurer will co ntrol the defense of the 
claim. 
C. The insurer will choose the defe nse counsel and control the def ense of the claim. 
D. The insurer will choose the de fense counsel, and Selfie will co ntrol the defense of the 
claim. 
4. A significant benefit of duty to defend forms is that 
A. The insurer must defend all allegations in a lawsuit as long as  at least one allegation is 
covered. 
B. The insurer must defend only th e allegations that would be cove red by the policy. 
C. The insurer is not obligated t o defend the lawsuit unless all a llegations would be covered 
by the policy 
D. The insured must defend all a llegations, and the insurer will r eimburse the insured for 
those allegations for which the  insured is legally liable. 
   
35 5. Under non-duty to defend directors and officers policies, an in sured 
A. may settle a claim within the ret ention without the insurer’s c onsent. 
B. may settle a claim within limits  without involving the insurer.  
C. avoids any need to keep the insur er informed of the details of the settlement process. 
D. must use the insurer’s defense attorneys.  
36 Answers to Chapter 4 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Time less retains $100,000 in any case . 
B. That’s correct! Since it was dete rmined that the insurer had no  liability under the policy for the 
applicable claim, the insured is required to repay the insurer all defense costs that were advanced. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The insurer did not spend $100,000 in  defending Timeless. Timeless 
already incurred that expen se using its own funds. 
D. This answer is incorrect. This answer would be correct if it ha d been determined that the claim 
was covered, but in this case, it turned out that the insurer h ad no liability. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorr ect. This is exactly what Robert wishes to  avoid. 
B. That’s correct! Ideal wording in a D&O policy woul d state that the insurer is barred from seeking 
such reimbursement. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. A majority of jurisdictions allow ins urers to recoup uncovered defense 
costs, even in the absence of policy language addressing this i ssue. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Some D &O policies include a reimburse ment provision of this type,

37 Chapter 5 
Limits and Retentions under D&O Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 5 explains the manner in  which limits and retention/ded uctible provisions apply within public 
company D&O policies. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. recognize the relationships am ong limits and retentions (deduct ibles) provisions in corporate 
D&O policies; and 
2. given relevant information concer ning a covered D&O claim, iden tify the amount payable by the 
insurer and/or the insured. 
Policy Limits 
D&O policies are customarily wr itten subject to an aggregate li mit applying to losses paid under any one 
of the policy’s insuring agreemen ts: (1) coverage for directors /officers (Side A), (2) corporate 
reimbursement coverage (Side B) , (3) coverage for entity securi ties claims (Side C), and (4) derivative 
investigation coverage (Side D) , if applicable. In effect, the policy limit will be applied in any 
combination to one or more cla ims that are covered by one or mo re of these insuring agreements. 
Therefore, when buying D&O insurance, an insured purchases a po licy with a single, aggregate limit that 
may be applied to claims falling within the coverage scope of a ll four insuring agreements.  
Limits under “Packaged” or “M anagement Liability” Policies 
A number of D&O policies (especially those written to cover pri vately held and nonprofit firms) are 
written in a “packaged” format ( and are also known as “manageme nt liability policies”). Such policies 
also cover EPL and fiduciary liability claims. Most “package po licies” afford a separate limit for each of 
these three exposures, while a ha ndful are written with an aggr egate limit for D&O, EPL, and fiduciary 
liability claims (as is the case with for-profit D&O forms). 
Defense Costs within Limits  
D&O insurance policies include d efense costs within the policy limits, meaning that the expenditure of 
defense costs reduces the policy’ s limit of liability. (This ap proach contrasts with that used under 
commercial general liability (CGL)  policies, under which defens e costs do not reduce available policy 
limits.) Since many D&O suits involve highly complex areas of c ommercial and civil law, they are among 
the most expensive legal actions  to defend. Consequently, limit s should be selected not only to cover 
potential judgments and settlement s but also in consideration o f high, anticipated defense costs, as well.   
38 Internal Insurer Claim Management C osts Do Not Reduce Policy Li mits 
Although the costs incurred by o utside counsel engaged to defen d claims made against insureds reduce 
policy limits, this is not the case with respect to the insurer ’s internal claim handling costs required to 
manage a claim. For e xample, although an insurer’s claim depart ment will review a claim, analyze 
coverage and liability aspects, a nd collaborate with and monito r the activities of outside counsel in 
conjunction with that claim, the  implicit costs of the insurer’ s claim personnel will not reduce policy 
limits.  
Lack of Coverage for First-Dollar Defense 
It should also be noted that D&O policies do not afford first-d ollar defense covera ge. For example, even 
if a claim were to involve only defense costs (and no judgment or settlement amount were payable), the 
insured would nevertheless be r equired to absorb the amount of the policy’s retention before the insurer 
would indemnify or pay defense co sts on the insured’s behalf.  
Exhaustion of Limits Terminates Duty To Defend 
Another point to recognize is that virtually all D&O policies s tate that, once limit s have been exhausted 
by any combination of claim payme nts and defense expenditures, the insurer’s duty t o defend any claims 
against the insured ceases.  
Importantly, clauses of this type  apply only to situations wher e actual claim payments —rather than 
reserves set aside for pending claims—have exceeded limits.  
Related Claims Provisions 
Related claims provisions, also  known as “interrelated claims” or “interrelated acts” provisions, apply to 
situations in which more than one claim results from a single w rongful act or a series of related wrongful 
acts.  
These provisions usually state tha t (1) the insured receives th e protection provided by the limit of 
coverage applicable when the first claim was made, rather than the sum of the limits that were applicable 
to the policy periods during which all the claims were made; an d (2) only one deductible/retention applies 
to all the claims (a point that will be further discussed in th e following pages). 
An Example 
Assume that on July 1, 2018, an insured officer commits a wrong ful act. Three separate claims are made 
against the insured (in conjunction with the act) on November 1 , 2018; November 1, 2019; and November 
1, 2020, respectively. Also assume that a $5 million policy was  in effect on the date the first claim was 
made and that two separate $5 million policies were also in eff ect on the dates the second and third claims 
were made. Under a related clai ms provision, the $5 million lim it of coverage availa ble on November 1, 
2018 (i.e., the date on which the first policy was in effect and the first claim was made), is the total 
amount that will be available to cover all three  claims. This is because all three claims arose from the 
same wrongful act. In effect, the purpose of the related claims  provision is to prevent a “stacking” of 
policy limits.  
Additionally, despite the fact tha t three separate claims have been made, only one self-insured retention 
will apply to all three claims. 
Potential Bad Faith and Policy Limits  Issues under Duty To Defend Policies 
Whenever a policy is written w ith defense costs included in the  limit of liability, there are potential bad 
faith issues for insurers to consider. For example, assume that  a D&O policy is written with a $2 million 
limit. A corporation receives a $1 million demand. Three years later, if the insurer has already expended 
$1.5 million in defending the cla im, the insurer would be unabl e to settle the claim within the policy’s  
39 limits, despite the fact that the claimant’s initial demand was  only $1 million (i.e., the $1 million demand 
plus the $1.5 million already e xpended on defense equals $2.5 m illion, which exceeds the $2 million 
policy limit).  
Note: In the above example, the  insurer might, in theory, still  be able to settle the c laim for, say, $500,000 
or prevail with no damages awar d at all—thus remaining within p olicy limits. Such outcomes are 
unlikely, however.  
These kinds of “shrinking limit” situations (where defense cost s reduce policy limits) place a 
responsibility on insurers covering insureds on a duty to defen d basis to keep insureds continually advised 
of current defense expenditure amounts so that strategic settle ment decisions can be effectively made and 
potential bad faith claims avoide d. (Normally, insurers provide  insureds with quarterly statements as to 
defense monies expended on any gi ven claim. In the event that i nsureds are not furnished with such 
information, they should request it from their insurer.) 
Of course, under non-duty to defend policies, in which insureds  control the defense process (and are 
therefore aware of all billings s ubmitted to the insurer), the argument could be made that insureds are 
already cognizant of the extent to which policy limits have bee n reduced. Therefore, shrinking limits 
issues are less problematic under non-duty to defend policies, compared to situations in which coverage is 
written on a duty to defend basis.  
Retentions 
The corporate reimbursement coverage (Side B) and the entity se curities coverage (Side C) provided by a 
D&O policy are subject to reten tions. Direct coverage for direc tors and officers (Side A) and derivative 
investigation coverage (Side D) are typically not subject to re tentions. This is, of course, advantageous for 
the individual directors and officers.  
Retentions in Multiple Claim Situations 
It is common for a single wrongful act to produce a number of c laims (i.e., by diffe rent claimants). 
Without a policy provision to the contrary, this may cause rete ntions to “stack” on each other. To 
illustrate, if Side B of a D&O liability policy has a $500,000 per claim retention, and a single wrongful 
act leads to claims filed by three different persons against th e insureds, the parent company could retain as 
much as $1.5 million of the loss payments and defense costs. To  prevent such situations, anti-stacking 
clauses indicating that only one retention applies per wrongful  act are included in virtually all D&O 
policies.  
Even in the absence of an anti-stacking provision, nearly all c ourts have held that, if one or more 
interrelated causes are found to have resulted in all of the in juries or damages claimed, there is but one 
loss for the purpose of determi ning the applicability of retent ions. Accordingly, even if a policy did not 
contain an anti-stacking provision, as a matter of common pract ice, a single retenti on would be applied if 
one wrongful act produced multiple  claims (as in the example in  the preceding paragraph).

and the insurer has paid $300,0 00 in defense costs and $200,000  in damages. The insurer has just 
set aside $500,000 in reserves to cover the cost of claims that  are still pending. At this time, 
A. because its limits have been exha usted, the insurer has no furt her duty to defend Golden 
Slipper against D&O claims. 
B. the insurer has a duty to defe nd Golden Slipper until it has pa id another $800,000 in 
damages. 
C. the insurer still has a duty to defend pending D&O claims again st Golden Slipper. 
D. the policy limits are automatically increased by 25 percent. 
4. Klutz Company has a directors and officers (D&O) policy with a $1 million limit and a $100,000

42 Answers to Chapter 5 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Covera ge B, C, and D limits are not e xpressed as a percentage of the 
Coverage A limit. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The po licy does include at least one aggregate limit. 
C. That’s correct! The policy has a single, aggregate limit that m ay be applied to claims falling within 
the coverage scope of all four insuring agreements. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The li mit does not separately apply t o each coverage. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. More than $400,000 remains available to pay covered damages. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The in surer’s internal claims handlin g costs do not reduce policy limits. 
C. That’s correct! The implicit costs of the insurer’s claims pers onnel will not erode policy limits. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The policy has a $1 million limit. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The li mits have not been exhausted by  actual claim payments. 
B. This answer is incorrect. By th e time it pays another $800,000 in damages, the in surer will have 
paid out much more than the policy’s $1 million limit. 
C. That’s correct! The insurer’s duty to defend does not cease unt il it has actually paid $1 million in 
damages and defense costs. Reserves don’t count. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Claim s do not automatically increase the policy limit. 
4.  
A. That’s correct! The insured is required to absorb the amount of  the policy’s retention before the 
insurer would indemnify or pay defense costs on the insured’s b ehalf. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The in sured and the insurer do not sp lit defense costs 50/50. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Defens e costs are less than the reten tion. 
D. This answer is incorrect. One hundred thousand dollars is the r etention amount, not the amount 
spent on this claim. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The amount of coverage available does  not depend on the limit of 
coverage in force when the  wrongful act took place. 
B. That’s correct! The insured receives the protection provided by  the limit of coverage applicable 
during year 2 when the first claim was made. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Nine m illion dollars is the sum of li mits available during years 2, 3, and 4 
combined, but these lim its may not be stacked. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The $1 million limit available during  the year when the wrongful act 
occurred should not be considered.

Conditions in D&O Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 6 addresses the conditions  provisions universally found  in D&O forms, which include 
severability, cancellation, subroga tion, other insurance, arbit ration, priority of payments, and presumptive 
indemnification provisions.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to evaluate t he following types of conditions in D&O 
forms and determine whether a given provision is favorable or u nfavorable to the insured: 
1. severability, 
2. cancellation, 
3. subrogation, 
4. other insurance, 
5. arbitration, 
6. priority of payments, and 
7. presumptive indemnification. 
Severability 
In a D&O policy, the term “sever ability” means that either (1) the application for D&O coverage or (2) 
the exclusions within a policy apply individuall y to each insur ed, as if a separate contract of insurance 
were in place.  
Typically, a D&O policy contains two separate severability prov isions: one applying to the application 
and the other pertaining to the policy’s exclusions. 
Application Severability versu s Severability of Exclusions 
If, in a claim situation, an exclusion applies to one insured d ue to some action on the part of that insured, 
severability operates so that c overage is not barred as respect s other insureds. For example, if an officer 
commits fraud and, along with him, the firm’s other directors a nd officers are sued, the policy’s 
fraud/dishonesty exclusion would not apply—coverage would be av ailable—to the so-called innocent 
insureds. (Note: Severability pro visions usually apply only to a D&O policy’s conduct-related exclusions 
such as illegal personal profit and fraud/dishonesty and are di scussed in more detail in Chapter 7.)  
Similarly, assume that one director knew the application for co verage contained a material misstatement 
(e.g., the director knew that the  company’s financial statement s contained intentionally inflated earnings 
data). This knowledge would nega te coverage for that particular  director. However, a severability 
provision stating that such know ledge was not imputable to othe r directors or officers would preserve 
coverage for these nonculpable in sured persons in the event the y were sued in conjunction with the 
misstatement within the application.   
44 In effect, severability, as to the exclusions or the applicatio n, creates a separate  policy and a separate  
application, respectively, so that  the actions of one insured d o not defeat coverage for another, innocent 
insured.  
Why Has Severability Become Important? 
Severability provisions have become increasingly important beca use a significant percentage of claims 
against insured directors and officers have involved both so-ca lled white hat (i.e., nonculpable insureds 
who did not commit fraud) and bl ack hat insureds (i.e., culpabl e insureds who did commit fraud).  
It has become commonplace for cl aims to be made against persons  who were guilty of willful conduct in 
causing claims—along with those who were innocent of any intent ional wrongdoing. Usually, it is outside 
directors who are unaware of the fraud committed by the officer s who run the company’s day-to-day 
operations. However, absent sever ability of both the applicatio n for coverage and policy exclusions, 
coverage could otherwise be den ied to these innocent insureds, since the wrongful knowledge/conduct of 
culpable insureds could be imputed to the innocent insureds.  
Directors and Officers Should  Review Applications 
Although the Enron case presents the most notable example of th e black hat/white hat dichotomy, many 
other less publicized cases have a lso involved intentional, wro ngful conduct by some insureds occurring 
on a parallel basis with that of o ther nonculpable insureds. Ev en where severability provisions appear in 
both D&O policy forms and applica tions (which is usually the ca se), it should be an established procedure 
within all organizations that every insured director or officer  be given a copy of the application with 
instructions to review it care fully so that any errors containe d therein, which a plain tiff’s attorney could 
construe as fraudulent, intentiona lly made statements, can be c orrected.  
The Two Types of Application Severability 
There are two types of severability provisions found within D&O  application forms: limited severability 
and full severability.  
Limited Severability 
Under a “limited” severability  provision, severability will app ly, and coverage will be  available to the 
other, “innocent” insureds, unl ess (1) the person who signed th e application had knowledge of the false 
application statement or (2) one of certain designated executiv e officers (typically the CEO or CFO) had 
knowledge of the false statement . Accordingly, knowledge of the  false statement by the signer of the 
application and/or the CEO or CFO will be imputed to all insure ds, and they will have no coverage. A 
minority of insurers’ applications contain limited severability  provisions, and such provisions are 
becoming increasingly unusual.  
Full Severability 
Under a “full” severability provi sion, which is the majority ap proach, knowledge of either the signer of 
the application or certain ex ecutive officers, such as the CEO or CFO, is not imputed to any other 
insureds, and, thus, such innocen t persons will have coverage d espite the false statement or knowledge 
about the false statement by such other persons.  
It should be recognized, however, that a “fully severable” poli cy is not the same as a “nonrescindable” 
policy. “Full severability” should not be confused with provisi ons barring an insurer from rescinding a 
policy based upon material, fraudul ent statements in an applica tion.   
45 An Instructive Case 
Cutter & Buck, Inc. v. Genesis Ins. Co. , 306 F. Supp. 2d 988 (2004), demonstrates the importance of th e 
severability provision within a D &O application. For fiscal yea r 2000, Cutter & Buck’s CFO accounted 
for a number of product “shipme nts” as “sales,” despite the fac t that distributors returned the goods in 
2001. This, of course, materially overstated the company’s actu al revenues. In 2002, when the firm’s new 
CFO discovered these fraudulent accounting practices, she order ed an investigation that ultimately 
required the company to restate its financials. A number of sha reholder lawsuits against the company’s 
directors and officers followed . Genesis Insurance Company resp onded by rescinding coverage, asserting 
that the insured CFO, who was al so the signer of the D&O applic ation and eventually pled guilty to fraud, 
had misrepresented material facts on the application. 
The application’s severability p rovision stated that knowledge possessed by one insured was not 
imputable to other insureds. But there was one critical exception : knowledge possessed by a signer of the 
application was imputable to in nocent insureds, which was exact ly what transpired in this situation.  
The judge found that Genesis was correct in rescinding coverage  on this basis. Here, the wording of the 
application’s severability provisi on did not bar Genesis from r escinding coverage for all of Cutter & 
Buck’s directors and officers because the knowledge of the CFO— who signed the application—could be 
imputed to others, including innocent directors and officers. 
The bottom line is that severability  is not just an issue for t he giants of the business world. Rather, it is 
important for firms of all sizes to carefully address severabil ity provisions when arranging their D&O 
coverage.  
Cancellation 
D&O policies have similar cance llation provisions, normally per mitting immediate cancellation by the 
named insured with no advance notice. Under these circumstances , premium is returned on a short-rate 
basis (i.e., pro rata unearned premium, less 10 percent). If th e insurer cancels, unearned premium is 
returned to the insured on a pro rata basis, although most poli cies only allow for insurer cancellation in 
the event of nonpayment of premium. 
In the event that the insurer cancels, 30 days is usually the m inimum notice period that policies require 
insurers to provide insureds. Note that 10 days’ notice by the insurer is the minimum notice period in two 
situations: 
 nonpayment of premium or  
 failure to reimburse deductible amounts. 
Although a majority of forms in clude cancellation notice provis ions of 30 days, some insurers (i.e., most 
of the insurers providing coverage on admitted forms) have stat e amendatory endorsements attached to 
their policies that extend cancellation notice periods to 60 da ys. Alternatively, some insurers’ policies 
include “regular” cancellation notice provisions as long as 60 days. 
Noncancelable Policies with Nonrenewal Notice Requirements 
Over time, D&O policies have tre nded toward more liberalized ca ncellation provisions. That is, a number 
of forms are written on a noncancelable basis (except that canc ellation is permitted for nonpayment of 
premium) and with provisions re quiring the insurer to provide u p to 60 days’ prior notice of its intention 
not to renew the policy.  
   
46 Subrogation 
Virtually all D&O liability policies contain similarly worded s ubrogation provisions. The policies 
mandate the insureds’ cooperati on in recovering from third part ies that were responsible for causing a 
claim to be made against the ins ureds. Such provisions reinforc e the fact that the insureds are not 
permitted to prejudice the insurer’s potential rights of recove ry against parties responsible for causing a 
loss.  
Other Insurance 
“Other insurance” clauses in D&O forms state that if other insu rance is available, the D&O liability 
policy shall serve as excess insurance. A common exception is w hen the other D&O liability policy is 
specifically scheduled as excess of the policy in question. 
The purpose of an “other insuran ce” clause is to prevent an ins ured from profiting as a result of a loss by 
collecting payment from more than one insurer. “Other insurance ” clauses also preclude an insurer from 
profiting by escaping payment of a claim it rightfully insured.   
Arbitration Provisions 
A significant number of D&O forms  contain provisions requiring coverage disputes between the insured 
and the insurer be submitted to binding arbitration, rather tha n allowing either party to resort to the legal 
system to redress the dispute. (This is known as a “mandatory” arbitration provision, although a minority 
of forms affords insureds the op tion, but not the obligation, t o submit coverage disputes to arbitration.) 
The effect of this provision is to expedite resolution of cover age-related controversies, given the long 
delays inherent in the conventi onal US judicial process. Also i mportant is the fact that arbitration 
typically reduces the cost of settling such disputes compared t o utilizing the traditional court system.  
Why Arbitration Favors the Insurer 
Although the mandatory arbitrati on provision benefits both the insurer and the insured for these reasons, 
arbitration probably affords greater benefit to the insurer. Th is is because it is generally believed that 
arbitrators are less biased against insurance companies than ar e judges and juries, as evidenced by the rare 
incidence of astronomical arbitra tion awards against insurers, compared to the occasional “runaway 
verdict” rendered by juries.  
Furthermore, insurers regularly hire arbitrators because insure rs are repeatedly involved in coverage 
disputes. Given their continuing  need for the services of arbit rators, over time, insurers are in a position to 
hire arbitrators “more selectively,” so that eventually they be gin hiring arbitrators whose previous 
decisions have tended to favor t hem. Conversely, insureds, give n the rarity of their participation in the 
arbitration process, are not in a position to select arbitrator s whose prior decisions have appeared to favor 
their interests. This is yet another reason why arbitration ten ds to favor insurers. 
Check Arbitration Provisions Carefully 
Although insureds should not anticipate becoming embroiled in a  claim dispute with t heir D&O insurer, 
the possibility is far from remote. In fact, the 2012 Towers Wa tson Directors and Officers Liability 
Survey revealed that 21 percent of organizations were dissatisf ied with their insurers’ D&O claim 
handling services, indicating the possibility of resulting cove rage disputes. 
Given the reality of potential  coverage disputes with a D&O ins urer, it is wise for insureds to carefully 
check the dispute resolution provisions in D&O policies. Follow ing are the points that demand particular 
scrutiny in any arbitration provision.  
47 Mandatory or Optional? 
Is arbitration mandatory in a ll instances, subject to demand by  either party? Or, can it be entered into only 
at the election of the policyholde r? The latter is the more fav orable version for an insured, since there may 
be situations in which counsel f or the insured does not feel th at arbitration is the ideal forum for resolving 
a dispute. In other words, the best provisions from the insured ’s standpoint are those giving the insured 
the option but not the obligati on to submit a coverage dispute to arbitration. 
Preconditions to Arbitration 
Do the provisions require that th e insured first submit dispute s to nonbinding mediation in an attempt to 
reach an agreement? Most do not, b ut some forms contain such a requirement. The problem with this 
approach is that, assuming each p arty pays its own costs, the ( usually) stronger financial position of the 
insurer may have the effect of “wearing down” the insured, thus  compelling a settlement prior to 
arbitration, which is not in th e insured’s best interests. 
Binding or Not? 
Are the results of the arbitration binding? Under most policies , but not all, arbitration is binding. Whether 
this is to the insured’s or the insurer’s advantage depends on the outcome of the arbitration and the facts 
underlying the dispute. 
Venue 
Does the provision state the venue in which the arbitration mus t take place? If so, does it favor the 
insurer, or does it make arbitra tion burdensome to the policyho lder? Under some policy forms, for 
example, an insured may be required to appear at an arbitration  in the United Kingdom, a situation that 
would clearly put a US insured at a disadvantage. 
Controlling Law 
Is the controlling law stipulat ed? Again, assuming the insured is an American corporation, US law in a 
specifically enumerated state should control the arbitration pr oceedings rather than the law of a country 
outside the United States. 
Panel Composition 
Is the approach for selecting the arbitration panel reasonable?  Usually, the provisions call for each 
participant to appoint one arbitrator, both of whom choose an u mpire. Sometimes there is a change from 
this, whereby restrictions are p laced on the background and exp erience of the arbitrators, and these could 
work to the advantage of one of the parties, usually the insure r that drafted it. 
Costs 
How are the costs of arbitrati on allocated between the parties?  Usually, each side must pay its own costs. 
Provisions requiring the insureds to pay the insurers’ costs in  addition to their own are to be avoided. 
Given the chance that an insured will, at some time, be engaged  in a claim dispute with its D&O insurer, 
insureds (or their representatives) should carefully analyze th ese points and, if any appear onerous, 
attempt to negotiate m ore favorable wording. 
   
48 Priority of Payments Provision 
When a corporation files a bankruptcy petition, it creates an “ estate,” which includes all of the property 
interests of the debtor corporation at the time the bankruptcy proceeding commences. One of the critical 
questions in such situations is whether the proceeds of a D&O p olicy should be treated as a part of the 
bankruptcy estate or whether those proceeds are the property of  the individual insured directors and 
officers. If such proceeds are c onsidered property of the estat e, they will be subject to the bankruptcy 
court’s jurisdiction and may not b e available to pay the defens e costs of the directors and officers.  
Why the Provision Is Important 
This issue was addressed in the bankruptcy case of World Health  Alternatives, Inc., decided on June 8, 
2007. In the decision, the judge ruled that the bankruptcy trus tee “could not prevent the company’s former 
directors and officers from usi ng the D & O policy proceeds to settle claims against them,” as reported by 
Kevin LaCroix in his June 17, 2007, post in The D&O Diary  titled “Bankruptcy and D & O Claims 
Settlements.” 
However, not all cases, and especially not all applicable polic ies, are alike, meaning that the above 
decision does not guarantee director and officer access to D&O proceeds in all future bankruptcy 
scenarios. Accordingly, it is adva ntageous for a D&O policy to include a priority of payments provision 
that specifically states that s uch proceeds are the property of  the directors and officers. A typical priority 
of payments provision states that payment will first be made un der Coverage A (D&O liability), then 
under Coverage B (corporate reim bursement), and lastly, under C overage C (entity securities). This is in 
keeping with the concept that the primary purpose of D&O covera ge is protection for individual directors 
and officers, then for the corporate entity, and finally, for “ other interests” such as a bankruptcy trustee.  
Limitations of Priority of Payments Provisions 
Priorities of payments provisions are helpful but far from iron clad. Although insureds should insist that 
they be included in a D&O policy, such provisions cannot be com pletely relied on. For one thing, federal 
statutes govern bankruptcy law, whereas state law is used to in terpret insurance policies. Since federal 
law takes precedence over state law, a bankruptcy court could d ecide to ignore a priority of payments 
endorsement. Furthermore, the validity of priority of payments provisions remains legally unclear, despite 
the fact that they do favor the interest of insureds over those  of bankruptcy trustees.  
Presumptive Indemnification Provision 
As noted under the “retentions” heading earlier in this course,  the typical D&O policy includes a 
substantial self-insured retention for corporate reimbursement (Side B) coverage and entity securities 
(Side C) and no retention for direct (Side A) and derivative in vestigation (Side D) D&O coverage.  
Why the Presumptive Indemnification Provision Was Introduced 
At one time, corporations attemp ted to avoid paying the Side B retention by simply electing not to 
indemnify the insured directors and officers, thereby forcing t he insurer to provide first dollar coverage 
for the directors and officers under Side A of the policy. 
In response, insurers placed “presumptive indemnification” prov isions in D&O policies, stating that, for 
the purpose of determining whether a claim is subject to the re tention, the corporati on will be deemed to 
have indemnified its directors and officers to the fullest exte nt permitted by law, regardless of whether the 
corporation does, in fact, indemnify the directors and officers .  
   
49 When the Provision Does Not Apply  
It is important to recognize, however, that presumptive indemni fication clauses typically do not apply 
when insolvency prevents the c orporation from meeting its indem nity obligations. Accordingly, one 
might think that directors and officers will also enjoy virtual  first dollar coverage when the corporation 
has filed for bankruptcy, which, in fact, may not necessarily b e the case. Rather, there are times when a 
currently solvent company will f ile for bankruptcy to forestall  a potential risk of future insolvency. As a 
result, if a corporation files for bankruptcy but is not actual ly insolvent, an insurer could argue that the 
presumptive indemnification clause requires the insureds to ass ume liability for the self-insured retention.  
Given this possibility, when ne gotiating the wording of a D&O p olicy (especially if there is a significant 
possibility of a future bankruptcy filing), the corporation sho uld ask the insurer to use language that 
eliminates the presumption of indemnification on filing of bank ruptcy, as well as when the corporation is 
insolvent.  
50 Chapter 6 Review Questions 
1. Severability provisions are impor tant to claims against insured  directors and officers that involve 
both white hat and black hat insur eds. In connection with the d irectors and officers (D&O) claims 
against the Hollow Wienie Company, which of the following would  be considered a black hat 
insured? 
A. Samantha Stephens, the corporat e treasurer who cooked the books  
B. Frank Furter, Hollow Wienie’s CEO who signed off on the financi al reports but did not 
know they were fraudulent 
C. Hilda Broom, pilot of the corporat e aircraft that transported b oard members 
D. Holly Moses, the personnel vice president who hired Samantha St ephens 
2. Careful reading of J-Fly Company’s directors and officers (D&O)  policy suggests that, no matter 
how innocent he or she might be, no director or officer of the company is entitled to protection 
under the policy if the CEO or CFO knows that the insurance app lication contains false 
statements. Based on this information, it appears that J-Fly’s D&O policy has 
A. a broad severability provision. 
B. a full severability provision. 
C. a limited severability provision. 
D. no severability provision. 
3. A typical directors and officers (D&O) policy includes provisio ns that 
A. clarify the policy’s relationshi p with other insurance and requ ire cooperation with the 
insurer’s subrogation efforts. 
B. permit other D&O insurance but prohibit subrogation. 
C. permit subrogation but prohi bit other D&O insurance. 
D. prohibit subrogation by the insur er and prohibit other insuranc e covering the same 
exposures. 
4. When comparing arbitration provisions in directors and officers  policies from the standpoint of 
the insured, 
A. the insured should preferably  pay all arbitration costs. 
B. mandatory arbitration is prefera ble to optional arbitration. 
C. restrictions on the composition of the arbitration panel usuall y favor the insurer. 
D. the venue in which the arbitration must take place is not a rel evant factor. 
   
51 5. Mustard Gas and Oil Company is f inancially stressed, possibly e ven headed for bankruptcy, due 
to competition from its major com petitor, Ketchup Petroleum. Mu stard is currently negotiating 
with its insurer over the wordin g of its directors and officers  policy. Given Mustard’s current 
financial situation, Mustard s hould attempt to negotiate contra ct language that

bankruptcy. 
B. eliminates the presumption of indemnification if Mustard become s insolvent but is silent 
on the possibility of a bankruptcy. 
C. includes a presumption of indemnification if Mustard becomes in solvent or files for 
bankruptcy. 
D. includes a presumption of indemnification if Mustard declares b ankruptcy but does not 
address the possibility of Mustard’s insolvency.  
52 Answers to Chapter 6 Review Questions 
1.  
A. That’s correct! Samantha committed the fraud. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. Although Frank can be held legally re sponsible for the financial reports, 
he did not commit any fraudulent acts. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. Hilda probably is not even an insured  under the D&O policy. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. Unless she was a coconspirator with S amantha, Holly is guilty only of a 
mistake in hiring. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The two types of severability provisi ons are limited and full. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Unde r a full severability provision, knowledge of either the application’s 
signer or certain executive officers is not imputed to any othe r insureds, so innocent persons will 
have coverage despite a false sta tement or knowledge about a fa lse statement. 
C. That’s correct! Under a “limit ed” severability provision, sever ability will apply an d coverage will 
be available to the other, “innocent” insureds, unless (1) the person who signed the application had 
knowledge of the false applicati on statement or (2) one of cert ain designated ex ecutive officers 
(typically the CEO or CFO) had knowledge of the false statement . 
D. This answer is incorrect. The information described here is fou nd in a severability provision. 
3.  
A. That’s correct! Other insurance clauses state that the policy p rovides excess coverage (subject to 
one exception) and require the insured to cooperate with the in surer’s third-party recovery 
attempts. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Virt ually all D&O policies permit sub rogation. 
C. This answer is incorrect. D&O po licies usually specify that the y are excess over other available 
insurance. 
D. This answer is incorrect. These policies require the insured to  cooperate with the insurer that 
pursues its subrogation rights. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Provisions requiring the insureds to pay insurers’ costs in addition to 
their own should be avoided. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Arbitr ation only at the election of t he policyholder is th e more favorable 
version for an insured. 
C. That’s correct! Restrictions on the background and experience o f the arbitrators usually work to 
the advantage of the insurer that drafted the restrictions in t he policy. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Requi ring arbitration proceedings in some distant location could be 
unduly burdensome to the policyholder. 
   
53 5.  
A. That’s correct! Because there i s a significant possibility of a  future bankruptcy filing, the 
corporation should ask the insurer to use language that elimina tes the presumption of 
indemnification on filing of ban kruptcy, as well as when the co rporation is insolvent. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The possibility of bankruptcy should also be addressed. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Mustard should avoid the presumption of indemnification. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The po licy language should anticipate  the possibilities of both 
bankruptcy and insolvency.  
54 Chapter 7 
Exclusions in D&O Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 7 examines the exclusions  found within corporate D&O po licies.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. identify the types of exclusions commonly found in D&O policies ,  
2. identify the effect of common D&O exclusions, and 
3. recognize the implications of vari ations in the wording of comm on D&O exclusions in a given 
situation. 
Exclusions are incorporated int o D&O liability policies in one of two ways: (1) They are contained within 
the policy form, or (2) they are added to the policy by endorse ment. Both types of exclusions can have a 
significant effect on the scope of coverage the policies provid e. Since D&O policies vary more in their 
exclusionary language than in a ny other coverage aspect, it is necessary to examine the exclusions 
carefully. 
It is also important to note that the exclusions in a D&O form are not always contained in the policy 
section titled “Exclusions.” They may also be contained within definitions (e.g., “loss” defined to exclude 
fines and penalties) as well as in the conditions section. 
D&O Forms Containing Mult iple Sets of Exclusions 
A minority of D&O policies incorporate as many as three sets of  exclusions: one set applicable to the 
corporate reimbursement section of the policy, a second set app licable to the coverage for directors and 
officers, and a third set appli cable to the policy’s entity sec urities coverage section. 
It should be recognized that a corporation’s bylaws and state s tatutes governing corporate reimbursement 
plans impose many of the same r estrictions found in the D&O cov erage exclusions. For this reason, these 
exclusions do not always need to be included in the set of excl usions that pertain to the corporate 
reimbursement coverage section. A s a result, a number of D&O po licies contain only a single set of 
exclusions that apply to the c orporate reimbursement, D&O, and entity securities covera ge sections (i.e., 
Coverages A, B, and C). 
Severability Provisions in Policy Exclusions 
As discussed earlier, by virtue  of what are known as severabili ty provisions, the actions of one director or 
officer are not normally imputed to any other directors or offi cers. For example, assume that a claim 
alleges that a group of directo rs and officers committed dishon est acts. If only one of these individuals 
was, in fact, proven guilty of t he dishonesty, based upon the s everability provision applying to the 
policy’s exclusions, the innocent directors/officers would not be barred from having defense coverage 
available for the claim. This is because the provision states t hat the dishonest acts of the guilty 
director/officer will not be imputed to the innocent director(s ) to bar coverage for these individuals.   
55 Severability provisions are also sometimes referred to as “inno cent director” or “nonimputation” clauses. 
(The concept of severability regarding statements made in conne ction with the application for a D&O 
policy was examined earlier in this course.) 
Exclusions for Which Severabi lity Provisions Usually Apply 
Insurers typically include severability provisions with respect  to the following exclusions. 
 Fraud/dishonesty/conduct 
 Personal profit  
 Illegal payments and gratuities 
 “Short swing” profits  
 Return of remuneration  
 Other insurance 
Care should be taken to verify that severability provisions als o apply to any similar kinds of exclusions 
that may be added to the D&O policy by endorsement.  
The following pages will discuss these sp ecific exclusions. 
 Claims caused by director/officer fraud/dishonesty 
 Personal profit exclusion 
 Illegal payments and gratuities exclusion 
 Exclusion of claims under Secti on 16(b) of the 1934 SEC Act (“S hort Swing” Profits) 
 Exclusions relating to various corporate activities 
 Return of remuneration exclusion 
 Prior and pending litigation exclusion 
 Exclusion of losses covered by a prior policy 
 Insured versus insured exclusion 
 Failure to maintain insurance exclusion 
 Wage and hour cla im exclusion 
 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) liability exclu sion 
 BI/PD/personal injury (PI) exclusion 
 Pollution exclusion 
 Inadequate considerati on (“bump up”) exclusion 
 Professional services exclusion 
   
56 Exclusion of Claims Caused by Di shonesty of Directors and Offic ers 
Insuring people for their individual liability arising out of i ntentionally committed illegal acts is not 
permitted as a matter of public policy. Accordingly, D&O polici es exclude coverage for dishonest, 
fraudulent, malicious, and crimin al acts committed by insured d irectors and officers. 
“Final Adjudication” versus “In Fact” Wording 
There are two versions of the dishonesty exclusion in D&O polic ies. The first requires a “final 
adjudication” before it can be a pplied. This version is viewed as being more favorable to the insured 
because it implies that the claim has reached a definite conclu sion (i.e., a settlement or a judgment).  
The second version requires that the dishonesty be established “in fact,” which sets up a lower standard of 
proof compared to the first version. This is because it does no t specify that the clai m has reached a final 
outcome.  
In addition, there is a certain d egree of ambiguity associated with “in fact” language compared to the 
“final adjudication” version of this exclusion. More specifical ly, if “in fact” means something less than a 
“final adjudication,” how and when does the insurer establish t hat the misconduct precluded by the 
exclusions occurred “in fact”?  
 Upon testimony or document pro duction during the discovery phas e of litigation?  
 Through facts uncovered by the i nsurer during its own investiga tion?  
 At trial, where, arguably, facts are established for the first time through admitted evidence?  
A final problem associated with “in fact” language is the quest ion of who determines when dishonest 
conduct has “in fact” occurred. Although not specified in the p olicy language, one insurer that has used 
“in fact” wording for many years has, in the past, advised its policyholders that it would not unilaterally 
apply these exclusions. Rather, it would seek the intervention of a third party, such as an arbitrator, to 
decide whether the misconduct had “in fact” taken place.  
In short, given these ambiguities , “final adjudication” wording  is much more favorable for the insured, 
compared to “in fact” wording, and should always be preferred w hen comparing the wording of the 
dishonesty exclusion. And for this reason, the use of “in fact”  wording has become rarer in D&O policies 
over time.  
Coverage for Defense 
By inference, the wording of th e dishonesty exclusion indicates  that the D&O policy c overs the cost of a 
successful defense against char ges of dishonest conduct on the part of a director or officer. In addition, 
defense and indemnity coverage is available if a settlement is made without admission of liability (which 
is typically the case in settleme nt agreement language). The av ailability of defense coverage in these 
instances is critical because the  majority of claim allegations  made against insured directors and officers 
contain specific charges that dishonest conduct was responsible  for causing a loss. 
“Final Adjudication” Wording in C onduct Exclusions May Not Always Be 
Advantageous 
Traditionally, and as already discussed, “final adjudication” w ording is considered preferable for the 
insured. However, there are some occasions in which this may no t be the case, such as when an insured 
director or officer pleads guilt y to certain charges, but a D&O  policy continues to provide defense 
because the case has not actually reached “final adjudication” yet. In a situation like this, other less 
culpable directors and officers are faced with a “shrinking lim its” problem while defense is provided for a 
presumably guilty director.   
57 Personal Profit Exclusion 
Another exposure considered uni nsurable involves claims that di rectors or officers have gained illegal 
personal profit or advantage to  which they were not entitled. F or example, an outside director may also be 
the owner or major stockholder of a firm that is bidding on a c ontract proposal offered by the parent 
organization. If the director’s company wins the bid because it  was proven that the director was privy to 
the bids submitted by competitor firms, a claim of illegal pers onal profit could be made, and if a lawsuit 
were filed as a result, the dir ector would not have coverage. 
“In Fact” Wording Is Preferable 
The most favorable versions of this exclusion state that covera ge for illegal personal profit is excluded, 
but only if an insured gained s uch profit “in fact.” The implic ation is that the policy covers defense 
coverage to allegati ons of personal profit until it is factuall y established that the insured gained illegal 
personal profit.  
Full Severability Usually—But N ot Always—Applies to the Persona l Profit Exclusion 
In TIG Specialty Ins. Co. v. Pinkmonkey.com, Inc.,  375 F.3d 365 (5th Cir. 2004), the CEO personally 
profited from the wrongful sale of stock. However, the personal  profit exclusion applied whenever “an 
insured” personally profited from the alleged wrongful conduct.  The court held that, under such wording, 
coverage was precluded for all in sureds, not just the culpable CEO. (It should be recognized that such 
severability language is unusual , although insurers do occasion ally use it.) 
On the other hand, had the exclu sion been worded so that it app lied only when “the insured” personally 
profited from wrongful conduct, it is likely that the court wou ld have ruled differently, that except for the 
culpable CEO, coverage would appl y to the other, “innocent” ins ureds. The lesson for insureds is that 
they should avoid severability la nguage in conduct exclusions t hat precludes coverage  when “an insured” 
is guilty of wrongful conduct. Instead, they should request lan guage precluding coverage only when “the 
insured” has committed such acts. Language of this kind will th en allow the severab ility provision to 
function as intended, whereby “i nnocent insureds” will not lose  coverage. 
Avoid “Any Willful Viol ation of Law” Wording 
A significant minority of D&O policies contain a personal profi t exclusion that is worded so that it also 
eliminates coverage for claims alleging “… any willful violatio n of law….” 
 
The problem with the addition of “… any willful violation of la w …” wording to the personal profit 
exclusion is that a number of ac tions by insureds may be consid ered willful violations of a law and yet 
still not give rise to criminal liability. Therefore, insureds could find themselves excluded from coverage 
for civil liability (arising, for example, from certain types of civil f raud), due to an exclusion intended to 
apply to criminal  acts. 
A number of industry experts be lieve that “any willful violatio n of law” wording is not a problem for the 
insured, provided the policy c ontains an exception—and thus cov erage—if a final adjudication proves the 
insured’s innocence, which most forms do. But implicit within t he exception is that final adjudication is 
reached only after  a trial, meaning there cannot be a covered settlement, despite  the fact that only civil, 
rather than criminal, charges ha ve been brought against the ins ured. So even with the exception, an 
insured will only have coverage for defense costs—but not for a  settlement. Thus, even with the final 
adjudication exception, “any willful violation of law” wording still reduces the extent of coverage 
because it compels the insured to  litigate, rather than settle,  to obtain any insurer reimbursement. 
Furthermore, final adjudication wording could still bar coverag e for appeals  that result after what was 
originally deemed a “final” adj udication. “Final and non-appeal able” wording, or similar phrasing, is 
more favorable for insureds.  
58 For these reasons, and in light of the fact that only a minorit y of insurers use such language, insureds 
should negotiate to have “any w illful violation of law” wording  removed if it appears within their D&O 
policy. 
Illegal Payments and Gratuities Exclusion 
This exclusion is sometimes called the “payments and commission s” exclusion. It excludes claims 
relating to the insured’s receiving or making payments that are  prohibited by law.  
The exclusion originated as a result of the Foreign Corrupt Pra ctices Act of 1977, which prohibits bribes, 
political contributions, gratuities , and other payments to fore ign or domestic officials. The Act was passed 
as a result of SEC investigations in the mid-1970s. Ultimately,  these investigations revealed that more 
than 400 US corporations admitte d making questionable or illega l payments in excess of $300 million to 
foreign government officials , politicians, and political partie s. The abuses were widespread and included 
such acts as bribery of high fore ign officials to obtain variou s forms of favorable action or consideration 
by a foreign government, as we ll as so-called facilitating paym ents made to ensure that government 
officials performed certain accounting and bookkeeping duties t hat were essential to the completion of 
various business deals.  
However, it should be emphasized that the exclusion prohibits c overage not only for illegal payments in 
conjunction with the Foreign Corru pt Practices Act of 1977 but also as respects any ot her applicable laws. 
The exclusion is typically incorporated in the text of the poli cy forms and is normally subject to 
severability provisions. Thus, if a claim of having arranged il legal payments were made against five 
directors and officers, but only one had actually done so, defe nse coverage would apply to the four 
innocent insureds.  
Exclusion of Claims under Section 16(b) of the 1934 SEC Act (“S hort 
Swing” Profits) 
Profits made from the director or officer’s personal sale of st ock in his or her own company, if the stock 
has been held for less than 6 m onths (referred to as “short swi ng” profits), are prohibited by the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Virtually  all D&O policies exclude covera ge of claims alleging violation of this 
rule. However, insurers usually p rovide coverage of defense cos ts when allegations of Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 violations are successfully defended.  
Exclusions Relating to Certain Corporate Activities 
Related to exclusions pertaining to “short swing” profits are t hose sometimes imposed for other, specified 
corporate activities. In most instances, such exclusions find t heir way into policies by means of standard 
or manuscript endorsements, rathe r than via standard policy wor ding. However, in some unusual 
instances, these restrictions are also included within regular policy form wording. Either way, they can 
eliminate coverage for significant D&O exposures. Following are  several of the most important types of 
such exclusions. 
Claims from Going Private/Leveraged Buyouts 
During periods of high private equity activity, such restrictio ns can easily find their way into D&O 
policies. This is especially tru e, since stockholders frequentl y allege conflicts of interest and self-dealing 
in claims associated with priva te buyouts. (In private buyouts,  private equity firms purchase the shares 
and ultimately gain control of publicly held companies. The pri vate equity group eventually resells the 
company later, hopefully for a higher price per share than the one for which it was originally acquired on 
the public market.)  
59 Claims from Mergers and Acquisitions 
Although these transactions do not  involve a private buyout, th ey nevertheless create the distinct 
possibility that stockholders of the acquired firm will allege that they were insufficiently compensated for 
their shares by the acquiring firm as a part of the merger or a cquisition. 
Claims from Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) 
Claims associated with IPOs are most often made by purchasers o f the newly public shares who assert 
that the offering prospectus did  not present a true picture of the company. Accordingly, D&O forms 
written for private companies (w hich are discussed later in thi s course) should be checked carefully for 
any restrictions or exclusions relating to claims from IPOs, si nce, during a policy period but well after 
having signed an application fo r coverage indicating no plan to  do so, the company could decide to float a 
public offering of its shares. Policy forms should also be chec ked carefully with regard to “road show” 
coverage, applying to situations in which a company “tours” in order to get in front of potential investors 
and/or other interested parties and garner interest before an I PO.  
Claims from Joint Ventures or Partnerships 
At times, corporations will opera te a joint venture or partners hip with another organization for a short-
term, time-limited business purpose. Underwriters sometimes pre clude coverage for joint ventures by 
means of “insured” definitions within their policy form. Accord ingly, such definitions should be checked 
and consideration given to nego tiating to include the joint ven ture or partnership as an insured under the 
policy. 
Although additional premium may be  required to remove these typ es of restrictions and exclusions, it may 
be well worth the cost, given the high claim potential inherent  in such circumstances. 
Return of Remuneration Exclusion 
Most D&O policy forms exclude c overage for monies paid to a dir ector or officer without stockholders’ 
approval. However, some D&O polic ies incorporate an important e xception to this exclusion by making it 
apply only when a court has held  remuneration to be illegal. If  possible, the exclusion should contain 
wording to this effect, which would make defense coverage avail able until an allegation of illegal 
remuneration is actually proven.  
Origins of the Return of Remuneration Exclusion  
Originally, the exclusion of ille gal remuneration was not commo nly found in D&O forms since, under 
SEC rules, the compensation paid to directors or officers was n ot subject to shareholder approval. 
However, concern about excessive compensation of management com mencing in the early 1990s has 
prompted a change in SEC rules, w hich now permit greater shareh older involvement in the setting of 
compensation for top executives. 
This, again, is an exclusion to which severability applies in a lmost all policies.  
Prior and Pending Litigation 
Nearly all D&O policy forms exclude claims arising from litigat ion that was pending prior to the 
inception of the policy or was pending prior to the policy’s “p rior and pending litigation date” (a date that 
is normally included on the declarations page of the policy or added by endorsement). The intent of this 
exclusion is to avoid insuring the so-called burning building, whereby the insurer must cover claims from 
events that were lacking in fortuity and that sometimes provide  the incentive for an insured to obtain 
coverage.   
60 How the Prior and Pending Litigation Exclusion Applies 
A prior and pending litigation ex clusion would apply if litigat ion against a corporation—rather than 
individual directors and officers—was pending prior to the ince ption of a D&O policy. If the lawsuit is 
amended after inception of the policy, so that it now names the  organization’s directors and officers, the 
prior and pending litigation ex clusion would preclude coverage for the amended vers ion of the claim.  
An Example 
On July 1, 2020, a borrower on whose home XYZ Bank has foreclos ed files a lawsuit alleging breach of 
contract against the bank. The s uit alleges that the bank misre presented the actual terms of the loan when 
the closing papers were signed , because the papers failed to st ate explicitly that after 2 years, the interest 
rate would jump from 3 percent to 12 percent. (Note that a D&O policy would not cover a breach of 
contract lawsuit against the ba nk because Coverage C, entity co verage, applies only to claims involving 
the securities of the insured corporation, or shares of the ban k’s stock in this example.) On January 1, 
2021, the borrower amends the law suit to also name the bank’s d irectors and officers. (In contrast, this 
claim would be covered, because c overage applies under Coverage s A or B for any cause of action.) A 
week after receiving the suit papers, the directors and officer s file the claim with t heir D&O insurer under 
their January 1, 2021–January 1, 2 022, policy. However, if the bank’s January 1, 2021–January 1, 2022, 
policy contained a prior and pending litigation exclusion, cove rage will be denied since the claim arose 
out of a lawsuit that was pending prior to the inception of tha t policy (i.e., the “original” breach of 
contract lawsuit was filed on July 1, 2020). 
Modifying the Prior and P ending Litigation Exclusion 
Often, insurers will agree to modify the prior and pending liti gation exclusion so that it only applies to 
litigation pending prio r to the inception da te of the present i nsurer’s first D&O policy. Given this 
modification, any litigation originally initiated during the pr esent insurer’s stream of protection will not 
be excluded. This is a reasonably negotiable item and can usual ly be achieved without additional 
premium. This modification can be accomplished by having the po licy’s “prior and pending litigation 
date” be the same as the inception date of the current insurer’ s first D&O policy. Using the example in the 
above paragraph, if the insurer first began writing coverage fo r the insured on January 1, 2020, and the 
prior and pending litigation date on the policy was also Januar y 1, 2020, the prior and pending litigation 
exclusion would not bar coverage  for the claim, since the origi nal litigation was not pending prior to 
January 1, 2020. On the other hand, if the prior and pending li tigation date on the January 1, 2021–2022 
policy described above was January  1, 2021, no coverage would h ave applied since the litigation actually 
began on July 1, 2020. As a general rule, from the insured’s st andpoint, the prior and pending litigation 
date should be as early in time as possible. 
Removing the Exclusion in Renewal Policies 
Insureds should also attempt to have the prior and pending liti gation exclusion removed in renewal 
policies. The purpose of the exc lusion is to avoid having the i nsurer cover situations that the insured knew 
or suspected would eventually r esult in a claim against the cor poration’s directors and officers. 
Accordingly, after the policy h as been in force for a year, thi s possibility is greatly reduced if such a claim 
has not yet been made. Thus, at th e first renewal, the insured should request that the prior and pending 
litigation exclusion be removed.  
   
61 Exclusion of Losses Insured by a Prior Policy 
Most D&O forms contain exclusi ons precluding coverage for claim s that have already been reported 
under prior policies, written either by the current insurer or by a previous insurer. Such exclusions are 
necessary to prevent insureds fro m reporting a claim—for the se cond time—under current policies with 
higher limits or broader coverage  provisions than those in prio r years, when claims were previously 
reported. 
For example, an insured reported a claim during the term of Ins urer A’s policy (January 1, 2020–2021). 
The policy’s limit was $5 milli on. For the January 1, 2021–2022 , term, the insured purchased a policy 
containing a $10 million limit from Insurer B. This exclusion p revents the insured from obtaining 
coverage under a policy with a  higher limit (i.e., $10 million)  by reporting the same claim to Insurer B if, 
for instance, the claim turned out  to require more than Insurer  A’s $5 million limit.  
Insured versus Insured Exclusion 
Insured versus insured exclusions  preclude coverage for claims made by one insured under a D&O policy 
against another. An example of a n insured versus insured claim (that would be excluded) is one in which 
corporate director “A” sues corporate director “B” because of a  bad business proposition that “B” advised 
the company to pursue, such as urging the acquisition of a subs idiary that eventually produced a 
significant loss for the company. 
Rationales for the Exclusion 
There are several rationales for the insured versus insured exc lusion in D&O policy forms.  
No Intent To Cover Recoupmen t for Bad Business Decisions 
The insured versus insured exclusion was originally introduced in the 1980s, when Bank of America 
began suing a number of its loan officers for losses caused by imprudent extensions of credit. In response 
to these lawsuits, the officers t hen sought cove rage under Bank  of America’s D&O liability policy. 
However, the bank’s insurer did not intend for the policy to fu nction as an indemnification vehicle for bad 
business decisions. (Insurers viewed such claims as affording c overage for “business risk,” rather than for 
professional negligence). So in r esponse, D&O insurers began in serting insured versus insured exclusions 
within their policy forms (a pr actice that was later extended t o other kinds of professional and 
management liability policy forms).  
Other, More Specific Insur ance Coverage Available 
Since many insureds also purch ase stand-alone EPL coverage (or buy EPL coverage within a 
management liability package po licy), D&O liability insurers fe el that employment-related claims by one 
insured against another (which , for example, would preclude cov erage if a CEO who is terminated sues 
the other directors and officer s) are more appr opriately covere d by policies designed expressly to cover 
employment-related liability risks.  
No Coverage Intended for “Infighting” 
Yet another rationale for not c overing claims made by one insur ed person against another is that, at times, 
such lawsuits are the result of “i nfighting” by one insured aga inst another. For example, in an attempt to 
force a director to resign because of a personality conflict, t he other directors sue him for negligence, 
alleging that he does not contribute adequately at board meetin gs.  
   
62 Key Exception Wording  
Despite the rationales for excludi ng claims by one insured agai nst another, the policies contain “exception 
wording,” which has the effect of providing coverage for certai n kinds of claims in which one insured 
sues another insured. Under the following circumstances noted b elow, most but not all D&O policies 
“except,” and therefore cover, the following claim situations.  
Derivative Actions 
These actions are brought by one o r more stockholders on behalf  of the corporation. Any recovery in a 
derivative suit inures to the benefit of the corporation itself  as opposed to the individual shareholders who 
institute the action (i.e., the proceeds of a successful deriva tive suit are paid to the corporation). If, for 
example, a director or officer were to bring a derivative suit,  the insured versus insured exclusion would 
not apply to the claim, and covera ge for the claim would be ava ilable.  
Employment-Related Claims 
Claims by one director/officer against another are not excluded  if they involve employment-related 
matters. For example, if an officer of a corporation sues the o ther officers and directors, alleging that he 
was wrongfully terminated, the exception to the insured versus insured exclusion would provide coverage 
for the officers and directors su ed by the terminated director.  Despite this exception, however, coverage 
may not always apply. This is because the majority of public co mpany D&O policy forms contain an 
exclusion of coverage for employm ent-related claims. (The exclu sion is discussed later in this chapter.)  
Claims for Contribut ion or Indemnity 
This refers to a situation in w hich one director or officer is sued and then, by means of another lawsuit, 
attempts to have other directors and officers contribute monies  for his or her defense and/or payment of 
the claim. Most versions of the insured versus insured exclusio n except coverage for these types of 
situations.  
Claims by Bankruptcy Trustees 
Bankruptcy trustees frequently make claims against directors an d officers. And because bankruptcy 
trustees should not be considered insureds under D&O policies, most policy forms cover claims brought 
by bankruptcy trustees by “excepting” them from the insured ver sus insured exclusion.  
Claims by Past Insureds 
This refers to claims made by persons who have not served as a director or officer for a period of at least 
5 years (provided they are not  bringing the claim with the assi stance of or at the urging of a person who is 
currently serving as a director o r officer). Given the 5-year t ime lapse, such claims are rarely motivated 
by either collusion or infighting and are therefore excepted fr om the insured versus insured exclusion.  
Claims Brought Outside  the United States 
The most frequent situation in w hich this exception applies, an d coverage is afforded, would be a claim 
brought by a director or officer of a foreign subsidiary and fi led outside the United States against the 
company’s US directors and officers.  
Whistleblower Claims 
Suits brought by insureds based on any protected activity speci fied in a “whistleblower” law also fall 
within one of the exceptions to the insured versus insured excl usion and are thus covered. For example, if 
an insured director reported ille gal activity under the whistle blower provision of the Dodd-Frank Act and 
was later sued by other director s and officers, coverage of the  claim would still apply.  
63 Failure To Maintain Insurance 
A number of D&O policies contain an exclusion of claims allegin g loss due to the failure of directors and 
officers to maintain property and liability insurance coverage.  The following scenario illustrates the way 
in which a “failure to maintain  insurance” exclusion could come  into play in a claim situation. Assume 
that an organization with a large  insured property schedule eit her has inadvertently omitted an individual 
property from the schedule or per haps does not have the correct  scope of property insurance coverage on 
this singular location (e.g., th ere is no coverage for flood on  a given manufacturing plant). The property 
suffers damage and is not insured, resulting in financial loss to the organization. This loss leads to 
litigation alleging director/officer negligence in managing the  corporation’s insurance program. If the 
D&O policy contained a failure t o maintain insurance exclusion,  the D&O insurer would likely deny the 
claim. In fact, taken literally, t he D&O insurer could deny alm ost any claim for which there would be 
insurance available, somewhere , and at some price. Since most e xposures are at least somewhat insurable 
somewhere and for some price, the vagueness of the language of the exclusion and the eagerness of many 
D&O insurers to deny claims are reasons for concern regarding t his language. 
Katrina Disaster Underscores the Dangers  of Failure To Insure Exclusions 
If there were ever a time when an insured would not want a fail ure to maintain insurance exclusion in a 
D&O policy, it would be in the af termath of a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina. Firms with 
substantial operations in the a ffected area were almost certain  to suffer considerable PD and business 
interruption losses—even if insura nce coverage was in place—giv en deductibles/retentions, coinsurance 
provisions, and valuation clauses that produce less than full r eplacement cost recoveries. 
For any firms that lacked flood coverage or had inadequate or n o property a nd/or business income 
policies at the time of the hurricane, lawsuits by investors co uld allege managerial negligence in failing to 
obtain appropriate coverage. Unde r these circumstances, a failu re to maintain insurance exclusion in a 
D&O form could pr ove problematic. 
Removing the Exclusion 
Given the problems this exclusi on could generate, insureds shou ld present the D&O insurer with a 
complete schedule of insurance coverage, along with a discussio n of the corporation’s risk management 
program. Based on this material , the insured will be in a bette r position to negotiate the removal of the 
exclusion.  
Exclusions for Insurance-Related Operations 
A few versions of the failure to maintain insurance exclusion a lso contain restrictions on claims involving 
the insured’s involvement with risk-bearing operations such as captive insurance companies and risk 
retention groups. Both for-prof it and nonprofit organizations s ometimes band together with firms in 
similar industries and form such risk-bearing entities. Separat e coverage is required for such operations.  
Employment-Related Claims Exclusion 
At one time, public company D&O  policies did not exclude covera ge for employment-related claims such 
as wrongful termination, discrimin ation, sexual harassment, and  retaliation (although they did not 
affirmatively cover such claims). In fact, some D&O insurers of fered endorsements that specifically 
covered EPL exposures.  
Since that time, D&O insurers have been moving away from EPL co verage extensions and toward 
exclusions for employment-related acts. This trend has been pro mpted by the fact that businesses are now 
likely to seek more expansive protection for these exposures un der a stand-alone EPL insurance policy. 
Furthermore, a significant minor ity of public company D&O insur ers have begun offering packaged  
64 policies to their insureds, which contain separate insuring agr eements for addressing EPL exposures 
(along with separate insuring ag reements for fiduciary and, inc reasingly for cyber and privacy exposures).  
Accordingly, insurers have added exclusions for employment-rela ted acts within their public company 
D&O forms, given the fact that most insureds have obtained EPL coverage either by means of a stand-
alone form or a package policy.  
Wage and Hour Claims Exclusion 
Most D&O policies exclude covera ge for wage and hour claims. Su ch claims most commonly arise from 
an employer’s alleged failure to pay overtime to employees it s hould have treated as nonexempt (i.e., not 
exempt from and thus eligible to receive overtime pay). All emp loyees are either “exempt” or 
“nonexempt.” Although those term s have many implications, the m ost important is that exempt 
employees (e.g., mainly professional staff employed on a salari ed basis, as well as outside salespersons) 
need not be paid overtime. Wage and hour claims most often occu r when an employee complains about 
not getting paid overtime to an attorney who then, after the in terview, realizes that he or she may have a 
six-figure class action claim on his or her hands. 
The exclusion of wage and hour claims first became an issue of urgent concern on July 10, 2001, when a 
California jury returned a $91 million verdict against a compan y (Farmers Insurance)  that had improperly 
classified its claims adjusters as exempt. Numerous high-dollar  settlements against a number of national 
companies, including Rite Aid ($25 million), U-Haul ($7.5 milli on), and Taco Bell ($13 million), have 
since followed. According to the “Trends in Wage and Hour Settl ements: 2015 Update” report from 
NERA Economic Consulting, there  were 613 wage and hour settleme nts between January 2007 and 
March 2015 for an aggregate of $3.6 billion paid out.  
There is an overtime exemption for executive, administrative, p rofessional, and outside sales employees 
under the Fair Labor Standards A ct and most state guidelines. T o be exempt, these employees must meet 
certain tests regarding job du ties and responsibilities and be compensated “on a salary basis” at not less 
than stated amounts. However, suc h tests are often confusing. I ndeed, the issue of who is an “exempt” 
employee is not always clear-cut. 
Modifying the Exclusion 
Although there is not much an insured can do about the standard  wage and hour exclusion, wording 
should be requested that modifies the exclusion so that it does  not apply to claims associated with the 
federal Equal Pay Act of 1963. Thi s law, which prohibits sex-ba sed discrimination in determining the 
wages of male and female employees, mandates equal pay for both  sexes when work involves equal 
levels of skill, effort, and responsibility and does not involv e the types of wage and hour claims already 
discussed. However, absent a clarifying endorsement to this eff ect, an insurer could stretch the intended 
scope of this exclusion so tha t it extends beyond prohibiting m erely a garden-variety wage and hour claim 
and also deny coverage for a cla im alleging violation of the Eq ual Pay Act of 1963.  
ERISA Liability Exclusion 
Claims are excluded under a D&O policy if they are based on a d irector’s or officer’s responsibilities as a 
fiduciary as defined in the federal ERISA of 1974 or similar la ws. ERISA and other liability exposures 
associated with administration of  corporate pensi on plans, prof it sharing, and employee benefit programs 
are insurable under separate fiduciary liability policies (disc ussed in a separate course within this series). 
Certain variations of this exc lusion also preclude coverage for  benefits due under a number of federal, 
state, and local labor-related statutes such as the National La bor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and  others.   
65 BI/PD/PI Exclusion 
Claims alleging the following are excluded under almost all D&O  policy forms. 
 BI (including sickness, disease, and death)  
 PD to or loss of use of tangible property  
 Libel or slander  
 Emotional distress  
 Other common PI perils (i.e., false arrest, assault)  
The purpose of the BI/PD/PI exclusion in D&O forms is to avoid an overlap in coverage between an 
insured’s D&O policy and its CGL  policy, which is expressly des igned to cover claims of this type.  
Two Key Variations of the BI/PD/PI Exclusion 
There are, however, two distinct versions of this exclusion. Pr eferably, the exclusion should be worded so 
that it applies only to claims “ for bodily injury and property damage” and not “to claims based upon, 
arising out of, or in any way related to  bodily injury or property damage.” 
The latter, “based upon, arising out of, or in any way related to” version could eliminate coverage not 
only for claims by persons suffering BI or PD (a CGL exposure) but also with respect to secondary claims 
by stockholders who sustain fi nancial loss resulting from the B I or PD of others (e.g., shareholders in an 
oil company suffer financial lo sses after an explosion at a maj or refinery). Such secondary claims are not 
covered under a CGL policy, thus c reating a gap in coverage if this wording is included. 
BI/PD/PI Exclusionary Wordi ng and Its Effect on Terrorism 
D&O insurers have not added terro rism exclusions to D&O forms. Nevertheless, a BI/PD exclusion using 
the “based upon, arising out of, or in any way related to” word ing could also have the unintentional effect 
of precluding coverage for acts of terrorism that cause financi al loss (e.g., terrorists destroy a 
manufacturing plant, causing loss of revenues and a consequent drop in a corporation’s share price). This 
example provides yet another reason to avoid the “based upon, a rising out of, or in any way related to” 
wording of the BI/PD exclusion if possible. 
Pollution Exclusion 
Most pollution exclusions in D&O forms are highly restrictive a nd exclude coverage for all forms of 
pollution. In addition to PD and BI caused by pollution, the po licies also preclude coverage for cleanup 
costs involving a pollution loss. They also eliminate coverage for penalties that might be levied against 
directors and officers. Such pe nalties could be applied when th eir decisions result in a violation of federal, 
state, or other environmental protection statutes.  
“Based Upon, Arising Out of, Related to” Wording versus “For” Wording 
It should also be pointed out that, like the BI/PD exclusion (d iscussed above), a number of insurers use 
language that excludes coverage “ for” pollution, rather than ex cluding claims “based upon, arising out of, 
directly or indirectly resulting from, or in consequence of” po llution. For the same reasons, “for” 
language is preferable for the i nsured and should be included w here possible. 
   
66 Inadequate Consideration (“Bump Up”) Exclusion 
A substantial minority of D&O policies contain what are known a s inadequate consideration or “bump 
up” exclusions. 
Frequently, following the purchase of one corporation by anothe r, shareholders of the acquired 
organization bring lawsuits alle ging that the purchase price pa id by the acquirer—and thus the price 
received by the acquiree’s share holders—was too low. In other w ords, such claims are based on 
perception of the stockholders of the acquired company that the y did not receive fair compensation for the 
value of their shares. As a resu lt, such lawsuits seek compensa tion representing the difference between 
what the acquirer paid and what  the shareholders of the acquire d company believe their shares were 
actually worth. 
“Bump up” claims can be quite c ostly. If there were 5 million s hares of a company outstanding at the time 
that it was acquired, a $30 per  share “bump up” would require t hat the acquirer “bump up” the original 
price by $150 million (5 million shares × $30). 
Insurers deploying this exclusion are of the opinion that the v alue of companies is, to a great extent, 
highly subjective. In effect, ins urers perceive that such claim s are essentially business risks and that to 
“second guess” the directors and officers in these situations i s beyond the scope of intended coverage 
under a D&O policy. 
Professional Services Exclusion 
Professional services exclusions a re steadily finding their way  into D&O policies. While the majority of 
D&O forms do not (yet) contain them at the time of this writing , insurers are more frequently adding 
exclusionary endorsements that p reclude coverage for claims inv olving the delivery of professional 
services, particularly with regar d to private company D&O polic ies. 
An Example: When a Professional Services Exclusion Would Apply 
A pharmaceutical company X announces that it will be 6 months l ate in introducing its new drug for 
treating late-stage prostate can cer. Following the announcement , and although the drug has not yet even 
been offered for sale, a competitor of X files a patent infring ement lawsuit against the company. A plunge 
in X’s share price ensues shortl y after the competitor’s lawsui t filing. The following week, a group of X’s 
shareholders files a securities class action stock drop claim, alleging various securities law violations. The 
claim alleges that the 6-month d elay in the release of X’s drug  resulted from errors committed during the 
clinical trials of the drug, whi ch were mismanaged by the compa ny’s vice president of research (a 
physician). The suit goes on to assert that the company’s gener al counsel (an attorney) provided faulty 
legal advice in failing to recognize that the supposedly new dr ug infringed on existing patents for similar 
drugs that were already on the ma rket. Lastly, the claim charge s that the company’s CFO (a certified 
public accountant) made erroneous p rojections as to the new dru g’s expected sales and profits. 
Now, imagine the company’s D&O policy contained the following p rofessional services exclusion. 
This insurance does not apply to any liability arising from pro fessional services incurred by: 
1. The named insured; 
2. The named insured’s employees; or 
3. Anyone for whom the named i nsured is responsible. 
Professional services means any of the following professions: m edicine, law, accounting, 
architecture, or engineering. 
Given such wording, the insurer  could make a reasonable case in  denying coverage for the company’s 
vice president of research, general counsel, and CFO—a doctor, attorney, and accountant, respectively.  
67 A More Favorable Version of th e Professional Services Exclusion 
Fortunately, a number of other insurers’ versions of the profes sional services exclusion use wording that 
is much more favorable for ins ureds. Specifically, their langua ge differs in three key respects. First, it 
only excludes coverage for claims arising from “services perfor med for others” and “for a fee.” Second, 
the wording excepts (and thus covers) claims from “alleged viol ations of securities laws.” Third, the 
language also excepts claims alle ging that the insured “neglige ntly managed or supervised such 
professionals.” 
The combined effect of these three exceptions is to exclude onl y claims involving the kinds of fee-driven 
services that are offered to third  parties by a traditional pro fessional firm, rather than those provided by 
professionals employed in a corporate setting, such as in the a bove scenario. 
Furthermore, as Kevin LaCroix discussed in The D&O Diary,  insureds in the service industry should be 
particularly adamant about ensur ing that the exclusion contains  the narrower “for” preamble, as opposed 
to “based upon or arising out of,” a point discussed throughout  this chapter. In his post on May 15, 2016, 
“Two Things D&O Insurers Regularly Get Wrong,” he stated that “ … everything a policyholder does in a 
service industry arises out of their performance of professiona l services. An exclusion with this wording 
threatens coverage for the most likely claims the policyholder could encounter.” For this reason, service 
industry insureds should be sure to closely examine the wording  of any applicable professional services 
exclusion.  
68 Chapter 7 Review Questions 
1. As with other insurance policies, exclusions in a directors and  officers insurance contract 
commonly appear in all the following places, except 
A. the application. 
B. the conditions. 
C. the definitions. 
D. the endorsements. 
2. Although Chopped Sewage Company’s directors and officers (D&O) policy excludes coverage 
for intentionally committed illega l acts, questions remained as  to whether the acts of Sam, the 
officer accused of a wrongful act, were intentional. Because th e D&O policy’s dishonesty 
exclusion contains final adjudication wording, which of the fol lowing describes the earliest point 
at which the insurer can deny coverage for Sam based on the exc lusion? 
A. A document produced during the di scovery phase suggests Sam int ended to commit 
fraud. 
B. An appeals court upholds the trial court’s finding that Sam int entionally committed a 
crime. 
C. At Sam’s trial, the plaintiff introduces evidence establishing the facts. 
D. The insurer’s investigation uncovers a witness to a conversatio n in which Sam described 
his plans to commit the fraudulent act. 
3. Missing Lynx Company’s directors and officers policy excludes c overage whenever “an insured” 
personally profits from the alle ged wrongful conduct. From the standpoint of an insured, the 
major problem with this wording is that 
A. it conflicts with the severability provision and creates an amb iguity. 
B. it precludes coverage for all insureds, even those who are not culpable. 
C. the exclusion fails to clarify who is an insured. 
D. the party that profits from the alleged conduct is the party th at needs the coverage. 
4. Exceptions to the insured versus insured exclusion in a directo rs and officers (D&O) policy 
normally provide coverage for all the following situations, exc ept: 
A. A bankruptcy trustee sues corporate directors and officers. 
B. A director seeks indemnificati on from another director for expe nses resulting from a 
lawsuit against the first director. 
C. A former director, who left the  board 10 years ago but is still  a major stockholder, sues 
current directors. 
D. A corporation sues its officers for making bad decisions. 
   
69 5. Noah Sark Ferry Corporation st ock became worthless when passeng ers’ injury and death claims 
exceeded corporate assets after th e ferry capsized during a sto rm. The ferry and vehicles aboard 
the ferry were also destroyed. Shareholders sued corporate pres ident and boat captain Noah Sark 
for a wrongful act arising out of bad management, alleging that  the boat should not have been 
sailing when a severe storm was predicted. The corporation’s di rectors and officers (D&O) policy 
precludes coverage for claims ba sed upon, arising out of, or in  any way related to bodily injury 
(BI) or property damage (PD). In this case, the D&O claim 
A. is covered because it alleges a wrongful act that is not relate d to BI or PD. 
B. is covered because it is based on the stockholders’ emotional d istress. 
C. is not covered because it is related to the BI to passengers an d the PD to their vehicles. 
D. is not covered because devaluati on of corporate stock is a form  of PD.

71 Chapter 8 
Coverage Triggers in D&O Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 8 explains the nature of  D&O policy coverage triggers. It begins by discussing how they function 
and describes the key terms associated with claims-made coverag e triggers (i.e., retroactive dates, 
discovery provisions, and extended reporting provisions).  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. identify what must take place to trigger coverage under a claim s-made policy, 
2. recognize the meaning of terms associated with claims-made D&O coverage,  
3. recognize the effect of common variations in D&O policies’ clai ms-made provisions, and 
4. given relevant case information , determine whether D&O coverage  has been triggered. 
Operation of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
Virtually all of the major insurers’ policy forms are written o n a claims-made basis. To be covered under 
a claims-made policy, a claim must be  
1. first made  against an insured during the policy period,  
2. resulting from a wrongful act that took place on or after the p olicy’s retroactive date , and 
3. reported to the insurer  prior to the expiration of the policy (or within 30 to 60 days  following 
expiration).  
The italicized terms will be explai ned in the pages that follow . 
Operation of a claims-made cove rage trigger is illustrated in E xhibit 8.1.  
72 Exhibit 8.1 
How a Claims-Made Policy Functions 
Policy Period: 1/1/16–1/1/17 
Retro Date: 1/1/12 Wrongful Act: 7/1/15 
Claim Made Against  Insured: 7/1/16 
Claim Reported to Insurer: 9/15/16  
 
In this example, coverage applies because (1) the claim was fir st made against the insured during the 
January 1, 2016–2017, policy perio d, (2) the wrongful act took place after the policy’s January 1, 2012, 
retroactive date, and (3) the cl aim was reported to the insurer  prior to policy expiration. Had the 
wrongful act taken pl ace prior to the polic y’s January 1, 2012,  retroactive date, coverage would not 
have applied. Similarly, there would have been no coverage had the claim been made against the 
insured prior to January 1, 2016 , or after January 1, 2017. Las tly, there would have been no coverage 
had the claim been reported to the insurer after the policy exp iration date of January 1, 2017 (although 
in actual practice, most policy forms contain either a 30 or 60  day post-policy reporting “window” 
allowing the insured to report t he claim to the insurer within 30/60 days after the date the policy 
expires).  
The Significance of “First Made” Language 
Use of the term “first made” is significant because it indicate s that coverage will apply only when the 
claim has not previously been made in conjunction with (1) a pr ior policy written by the current insurer or 
(2) a policy written by a different insurer, covering the insur ed prior to the current policy.  
Claims-Made and Reported Policies 
Under a minority of D&O policies , coverage applies only if the claim is both first made against the 
insured and reported to the insurer during the policy period. T his is known as a “claims-made and 
reported” policy. For example, under such a policy with a Janua ry 1, 2020–2021, term, no coverage 
would apply unless a claim was bot h made against the insured du ring the policy period and also reported 
to the insurer prior to January 1, 2021.  
Claims-Made Policies and Reported Policies with Post-Policy Rep orting “Windows” 
In contrast, nearly all forms provide what are known as post-po licy claim reporting “windows,” under 
which claims made against the in sured during the policy period can be reported to the insurer for either 30 
or 60 days (depending upon the insurer) after expiration of the  policy.  
D&O forms containing post-policy reporting “windows” are prefer able to claims-made and reported 
policies. This is because some circumstances could render it im possible for an insured to report a claim 
made late in a policy period.  
 
73 An Example 
If a summons is delivered to an insured CEO’s office late in th e day that a policy expires, the insured may 
be unable to notify the insurer within the policy period. This case may be especially true if he or she was 
not in the office that day or if  the summons was served late in  the day at the start of a long, holiday 
weekend, as a result of which t he insurer’s office had closed e arlier than usual. Under such circumstances, 
a claims-made policy that contains a 30-day or, preferably for the insured, a 60-day post-policy reporting 
window is advantageous compared to a claims-made  and reported p olicy because it allows an insured to 
report a claim to the insurer after the term of coverage has ex pired. 
Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates in D&O liability policies state that, for cov erage to apply, the wrongful act giving rise 
to a claim must have taken place on or after the retroactive da te. Thus, retroactive dates preclude coverage 
for claims stemming from acts that took place prior to a policy ’s retroactive date. 
Purposes of Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates have the eff ect of excluding coverage for pos sible wrongful acts committed in 
conjunction with some known even t (i.e., known to the insured) that took place prior to policy inception. 
They also preclude coverage for w rongful acts that transpired i n the distant past—even if unknown to the 
insured. 
Retroactive dates are generally  included in D&O liability polic ies for organizations that are buying 
coverage for the first time. T his is because underwriters are r eluctant to offer “full prior acts coverage” 
(i.e., policies without retroactive dates) under such circumsta nces. Their concern is that the insured’s 
sudden desire to obtain a policy may have been prompted by the need to obtain coverage for 
circumstances they suspect coul d produce a claim in the future.  For example, if a company began doing 
business on January 1, 2010, but d id not seek to buy D&O liabil ity coverage until January 1, 2020, an 
underwriter could have the impre ssion that the company now expe cts a claim to be made against it 
shortly, since the business opera ted for 10 years without purch asing D&O liability coverage.  
“Full Prior Acts”: Coverage without a Retroactive Date 
However, if a firm already has a D&O policy in place and then s eeks coverage with a new insurer, 
inclusion of a retroactive date by the new insurer should be re sisted unless there is a specific underwriting 
reason, such as a complete change in the company’s operating ma nagement and board of directors. By 
eliminating a retroactive date , a policy will provide what is k nown as “full prior acts coverage” for all 
acts, going back to when the organization was founded/incepted.  
Retro Date Should Be No Earlier  Than the Insured’s First D&O Po licy Inception 
Ideally, an insured will have a policy written with full prior acts (i.e., no retroactive date) coverage. But at 
the very least, an insured should always require an insurer to offer a policy with a retroactive date that 
coincides with the date on which it first began buying D&O cove rage (known as “prior acts” coverage), 
even if that date precedes the date on which its current insure r first began writing coverage. If an 
insured’s retroactive date does not coincide with the date on w hich it first began buying coverage, a 
coverage gap will result since th ere will be no coverage for wr ongful acts that took place between the 
inception date of the insured’s first D&O policy ever purchased  and the retroactive date of the new 
insurer’s policy.  
   
74 Always Resist Retroactive Date Ad vancements When Replacing Coverage 
At times, underwriters seek an “a dvanced” retroactive date when  writing coverage for a new account. 
This has the effect of limiting the coverage they are willing t o provide to the start of the period of time 
this new insurer will be on the account. This approach is detri mental for an insured because it provides no 
coverage for acts that took place from the inception date of it s first policy to the inception date of the new 
insurer’s policy. Accordingly, D&O  insureds and their agents/br okers should always resist such 
advancements, even if  additional premium is required to achieve  “prior acts” coverage.  
Option Backdating Claims Illustrate the Importance of Retroactive Dates 
The wave of option backdating cl aims that surfaced in the summe r of 2006 illustrates the potential 
problems that can result from retr oactive dates in D&O policies . (Option backdating occurs when a stock 
option exercise date is set prior to the date on which the opti on was granted and at a lower exercise price 
than the current market price of  the company’s stock. Directors  and officers are frequently compensated 
by means of option grants, in a ddition to salary.) Option backd ating is not illegal if the backdating is 
clearly communicated to stockholde rs and if earnings reports an d tax payments properly reflect the effect 
of the backdating. However, a num ber of lawsuits against corpor ate directors and officers have alleged 
illegal option backdati ng in which these conditions were not me t.  
Many of these claims related to option grants that were made du ring the mid-to-late 1990s, in some cases 
as many as 10 years earlier. So un less the retroactive date on an insured corporation’s current D&O policy 
form—the one under which an opt ions backdating claim was being made—is earlier in time than the 
alleged wrongful acts associated with these options grants, no coverage will be available. 
For example, assume that improper options grants (i.e., the “wr ongful acts”) were alleged to have been 
made in 2007. Unless the insured’s current D&O policy contains a retroactive date of January 1, 2007 (or 
earlier), no coverage would apply, despite the fact that the cl aim was made against the insured during the 
term of the policy presently in force. 
As these circumstances illustra te, retroactive dates present po tential coverage problems because D&O 
claims have a way of “popping up” despite the fact that the all eged wrongful conduct giving rise to the 
claim took place many years earlie r, as was the case with these  option backdating claims. 
Retroactive Date Issues in Policies for IPOs 
One error is often made when str ucturing D&O coverage for compa nies making IPOs of their shares of 
stock to the public. Specifically , policies for such companies are sometimes written with a retroactive date 
coinciding with the date on which  the company first began selli ng shares to the public. This is normally 
the date on which such firms a re considered “public companies.”  There are two coverage gaps created 
under this scenario.  
No Coverage for Operations Prior to the IPO 
First, by setting the retro date as the date on which the compa ny begins selling shares to the public, it 
eliminates coverage for any claims that resulted from acts comm itted prior to that time. Few companies 
begin as publicly traded firms. More typically, they first achi eve success as privately held companies and 
then, some years later, begin selling shares to the public, mos t often because of the firm’s need to raise 
capital so it can expand its already successful operations.  
No Coverage for Prospectus-Related Claims 
Second, by setting a retroactive date coincident with the date on which it begins selling shares to the 
public, it will eliminate coverage for claims relating to the f irm’s prospectus. (A prospectus provides 
details about the company’s his tory and operations, including d etailed financial data , and is intended to 
serve as an inducement for people to buy shares of stock in the  company.) This is because an IPO offering  
75 prospectus is always prepared prior to the date on which shares  are offered. Thus, a ny alleged wrongful 
act associated with the prospect us (i.e., allegations by invest ors that the prospectus misrepresented the 
company’s financial condition) w ould have necessarily taken pla ce prior to the retro date and, as a result, 
would not be covered. Admittedly , a retro date coincident with the date on which the firm went public 
will likely produce a lower premium compared, for example, to o ne coinciding with its inception. 
However, given the relatively high risk associated with IPOs, a ny premium savings achieved in this 
manner are probably not worth it. 
Accordingly, if a company begins offering shares to the public and, as a result, seeks to buy D&O 
coverage for the first time, the  policy’s retroactive date shou ld coincide with the date on which the firm 
initially “opened its doors,” even if this was a number of year s prior to becoming or beginning the process 
of becoming a public corporation. This will also allow for cove rage for “road show” activities (alluded to 
earlier in this course), in which private companies essentially  go on a tour in order to garner investor 
interest in an upcoming IPO.  
Discovery Provisions 
Circumstances often arise under which it is probable that an ac t, error, or omission will eventually cause a 
claim to be made against insured directors/officers—despite the  fact that litigation may not be initiated for 
some time. Accordingly, virtually all D&O policies provide, by means of what are called “discovery 
provisions” (also known as “incident reporting provisions” or “ notice of potential claim provisions”), that 
if the insured advises the insure r of “incidents” or “potential  claims” during the policy, any claims arising 
out of such “incidents” will be c onsidered to have been “made” during that policy period.  
An Example 
A corporation announces that it did not meet its quarterly earn ings target and, as a result, receives 
negative commentary in the financial press. During the next wee k, the company’s sha re price drops by 20 
percent. This chain of events c ould be considered an “incident, ” reportable under a D&O policy’s 
discovery provision. While no cl aims have yet been received, th ere is a strong possibility that shareholder 
class action lawsuits will follow. 
When such notice is provided to  the insurer, coverage for these  claims will apply regardless of how long 
after the policy under which they  were reported has expired. Ex hibit 8.2 illustrates the operation of a 
discovery provision.  
Exhibit 8.2 
How a Discovery Provision Functions 
 
In this example, coverage applies because the insured notified the insurer of an “incident” on August 
1, 2010. Although the claim associat ed with the incident was no t made against the insured until after 
the January 1, 2010–2011, policy had expired, coverage applies nonetheless because the insurer 
was notified of the incident under  the policy’s discovery provi sion. Although the claim was made 
against the insured in this example 7 months after the policy expired, as long as the “incident” that 
gave rise to the claim is report ed to the insurer during the po licy period, regardless of how far in the 
future a claim is eventually  made, coverage will apply.  
 
 
76 Extended Reporting Provisions 
Extended reporting periods (ERPs ), which are also known as exte nded discovery or “tail” provisions and 
are included in D&O policies, giv e an insured the right to pres ent claims after a policy has expired or 
been canceled. Exhibit 8.3 illustrates how an ERP provision fun ctions. 
Exhibit 8.3 
How an ERP Functions 
Insurer A’s Policy Term: January 1, 2011–2012  
Insured buys an ERP from Insurer A with a term of January 1, 20 12–2013  
Wrongful Act: July 1, 2011  
Claim Made and Reported: July 1, 2012  
 
Coverage applies under the ERP bec ause the wrongful act took pl ace during Insurer A’s January 
1, 2011–2012, policy term and a claim associated with the act was made and reported during t he 
term of Insurer A’s January 1, 2012–2013, ERP. One final, key p oint regarding ERPs: No 
coverage would have applied in this example if both the wrongful act took place and the claim 
were reported during the January  1, 2012–2013, ERP period. Rath er, the wrongful act must take 
place during the expired/cancel ed policy period for coverage to  apply during the ERP. 
ERPs Do Not Reinstate Remaining Policy Limits 
ERPs do not, however, increase or  reinstate the policy’s limit of liability. Thus, coverage during an ERP 
is always subject to available remaining limits.  
No Coverage for Wrongful Acts during the ERP  
Nor do ERPs cover claims from wrongful acts that took place dur ing the ERP. In effect, ERPs only 
extend the time period during which wrongful acts that took pla ce during the expired (or in some 
instances, canceled) policy can be reported to the insurer. For  coverage to apply under an ERP, the 
alleged wrongful act giving rise to the claim must have taken p lace on or after the retroactive date, if any, 
of the policy and before the policy’s termination date. Thus, E RPs do not afford coverage for an act or 
omission that took place during the ERP itself, despite the fac t that such a claim is reported during the 
ERP. 
Discovery Provisi ons versus ERPs 
Although these two provisions are  often confused, the differenc e is straightforward. Discovery provisions 
allow insureds to obtain coverage for incidents  that are reported during  the policy period. In contrast, 
ERPs provide coverage for claims  that are reported after  a policy period has expired. 
Key Variations between ERP Provisions 
There are several important variations in the way that differen t D&O insurers write the key provisions 
associated with ERPs. These diffe rences are described in the fo llowing paragraphs.  
  
 
77 Availability 
The vast majority of D&O forms p ermit the insured to purchase a n ERP if cancellation/nonrenewal is at 
the insured’s or the insurer’s election. This is known as a two-way or bilatera l tail. Clearly, D&O policy 
forms that contain bilateral ERPs  are preferable to those offer ing only a one-way tail provision, which 
would only apply in the event of cancellation or nonrenewal at the behest of the insurer. The latter should 
be vigorously resisted when nego tiating coverage with an insure r. Fortunately, very few D&O insurers 
offer policies containing one-way tail provisions. 
Coverage for “Notice of Circumstances” during ERP 
A key variation between the ERPs in D&O forms is whether a repo rt of circumstances that have the 
potential to result—but have not yet resulted—in a formal claim  against the insured is covered by an ERP. 
In effect, under some insurers’ ERP wording, the policy’s disco very provision (discu ssed earlier in this 
section) is operative, whereas in others, it is not.  
Case in point: A D&O policy expi res on January 1, 2020, at whic h time the insured firm buys a 1-year 
ERP. On August 1, 2020, the insured firm becomes aware of circu mstances (from a wrongful act that took 
place during the expired policy) t hat could poten tially materia lize into a formal claim but have not yet. 
Under some insurers’ policies, t he report of such circumstances  would trigger coverage. However, under 
other insurers’ ERP wording, no coverage would apply until the insured has a formal claim made against 
it, even if these circumstances are reported to the insurer dur ing the ERP. 
Given the situation in the above  scenario, the insured would be  compelled to purchase (if available) 
another ERP at the expiration of  the current ERP, if the potent ial claim had not yet been made against the 
firm but was expected at some point. In this situation, the adv antage of having a policy’s discovery 
provision that is operative during the ERP provision is apparen t. 
Duration 
In most instances, D&O insurers offer ERPs of 1 year in duratio n, although in some cases, ERPs of longer 
durations are offered as well. Mu ltiple duration options (e.g.,  1 year, 2 years, 3 years) are often available 
under D&O policies written for priv ately held and nonprofit org anizations. However, publicly traded 
companies are not usually offere d anything other than a 1-year option.  
Premium Charge 
In nearly all instances, the polic ies state the premium charge for the ERP option. This is typically done by 
indicating that the ERP will cost a fixed percentage of the exp iring policy’s premium, normally 100 to 
200 percent, depending upon the individual policy, for a 1-year  ERP.  
Time in Which To Elect 
The majority of D&O policies allo w the insured up to 30 days fo llowing nonrenewal, expiration, or 
cancellation to purchase the ERP. A few allow as long as 60 day s in which to make this election, which 
is, of course, preferable since it is beneficial to maximize th e time period in which the insured can make 
this election. 
Runoff Policies 
As an alternative to an ERP, the re are certain circumstances un der which insureds should consider 
purchasing a runoff policy. 
   
78 Runoff Policies versus ERPs 
Like ERPs, runoff policies also permit an insured to report cla ims (that resulted from wrongful acts taking 
place during prior policy periods) for a specified period of ti me in the future. In contrast, the use of runoff 
policies is typically restricted t o situations in which another  organization merges with or acquires an 
insured, rather than when the insured replaces coverage with an other insurer, as is usually the case when 
an ERP is purchased. Like ERPs, runoff policies are usually off ered on a 1-year basis. However, unlike 
ERPs, they are typically offered  on a renewable basis, with a d ecreasing premium for each subsequent 1-
year renewal period.

80 Answers to Chapter 8 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. To trigger coverage, a claim must fir st be made during the policy period. 
B. That’s correct! The alleged wr ongful act need not take place du ring the policy period so long as 
other criteria are met. 
C. This answer is incorrect. To trigger coverage, a claim must be made during the policy period or 
any post-policy reporting window (the window is typically 30 or  60 days wide). 
D. This answer is incorrect. Acts occurring prior to the retro dat e are not covered. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! Claims made agai nst the insured during the poli cy period can be reported to the 
insurer for either 30 or 60 days (depending upon the insurer) a fter expiration of the policy. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The claim will not go through a windo w that is closed. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The act  must take place before the po licy period ends. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Coverage for an otherwise covered cla im may be triggered if the claim is 
reported during a short time period after the policy period con cludes. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Extended reporting periods are also k nown as extended discovery 
provisions. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Extended reporting periods give an in sured the right to present claims 
after a policy has expi red or been canceled. 
C. That’s correct! Coverage attached  to the back end of the policy  term is sometimes referred to as 
tail coverage. As a metaphorical contrast, retroactive dates or  other appendages at  the front end of 
the policy period are occasionally  referred to as nose provisio ns. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Because this type of coverage is atta ched to the back end  of a policy term 
in much the same way as a tail is  attached to the back end of a n animal, the insurance appendage is 
sometimes referred to  as tail coverage. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. There is no coverage for wrongful act s during the ERP. 
B. That’s correct! Coverage applie s to wrongful acts that took pla ce on or after the policy’s 
retroactive date and before th e policy’s termination date. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Only p art of this statement is correc t. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Wrongful acts occurring before the re tro date are never covered. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. A 30- t o 60-day time period is typica l. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The stipulation ma y be made after the  policy terminates. 
C. That’s correct! Nearly all polic ies indicate the specific ERP o ption’s premium charge as a fixed 
percentage of the expiring polic y’s premium and allow the insur ed 30 (sometimes 60) days to elect 
coverage. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Near ly all policies indicate what the  ERP premium charge will be; there 
is no need to wait for a quote.

Excess D&O Insurance Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 9 explains the nature and function of excess D&O polici es. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. identify the function of  excess D&O policies, 
2. recognize the essential features of  quota share excess D&O prog rams,  
3. distinguish between follow form e xcess D&O policies and indepen dent or stand-alone D&O 
policies, 
4. recognize the consequences under various scenarios of failing t o maintain underlying insurance, 
and 
5. identify the role of inte grated excess policies. 
Excess D&O policies are used in s ituations when an insured requ ires higher limits than any single D&O 
insurer may be willing to provide . In such situations, insureds  obtain a primary D&O policy and then 
proceed to build excess “layers” of coverage above the primary policy until a sufficient limit has been 
obtained. A layered D&O program is illustrated in Exhibit 9.1.  
Exhibit 9.1 
A Layered D&O Program 
 
  
 
82 Quota Share Excess D&O Programs 
Use of quota share arrangements a mong excess D&O insurers has g rown in frequency over time. Unlike 
the example provided in Exhibit 9.1 above (where only one insur er provided all of the coverage within 
each excess layer), the quota s hare approach involves the assum ption of a given layer of excess coverage 
by more than one insurer. Unde r such arrangements, participatin g insurers provide policies that afford a 
specific percentage of coverage within a particular layer. Exhi bit 9.2 illustrates a quota share D&O 
program. 
Exhibit 9.2 
Enron’s Quota Share D&O Program 
 
 
83 Exhibit 9.2 provides an example o f a quota share excess D&O pro gram. Specifically, it depicts Enron’s 
D&O program that provided a to tal of $350 million of coverage a t the time of its financial collapse in late 
2001. Note that the $50 million la yer of coverage, excess of $3 00 million, is afforded under a quota share 
arrangement, in which five differe nt insurers are participating  in various percentages to provide a total of 
$50 million of coverage. If, for example, there was a $25 milli on loss within this $50 million layer, each 
of the five insurers would contribute its respective percentage , as noted in Exhibit 9.2. So, for example, 
since Federal provided 50 percen t of the coverage within this l ayer, in the event of a $25 million loss, it 
would pay 50 percent, or $12.5 million.  
Coverage under Excess D&O Policies: Two Basic Types 
There are two basic types of e xcess D&O insurance policies. 
 Follow form policies  
 Independent or “stand-alone” excess policies  
Follow form policies are much more common. Over time, “stand-al one” excess policies have generally 
become less available.  
Follow Form Excess D&O Policies 
These policies adopt the coverag e provisions of the underlying policy or policies. This usually includes 
such matters as insuring agre ements, conditions, exclusions, an d other key coverage provisions. The 
insuring agreements state that, unless endorsed, the coverage p rovided by the excess D&O policy will not 
be broader than that afforded by the form immediately below it in the “tower” of coverage.  
Independent or “Stand-Al one” Excess D&O Policies  
These excess policies have their own complete sets of coverage agreements, definitions, and exclusions. 
However, as already noted, sin ce the late 1990s, such policies are rarely written. Rather, following form 
excess policies are by far more common.  
Underlying Limits of L iability Definition 
The manner in which an excess D&O policy defines “underlying li mits of liability” is important in 
understanding how excess D&O polic ies function. Typically, the “underlying limits of liability” are 
defined as the sum of (1) the pri mary D&O policy limits, (2) an y retention applicable under the primary 
D&O policy, and (3) all limits a vailable under any underlying e xcess policies.  
Limit of Liability Provision 
The manner in which D&O excess policies define the term “limit of liability” is also important in the 
functioning of excess D&O policies.  
This provision states that the  excess D&O insurer will pay loss es that exceed the “underlying limit of 
liability.” This means that the excess insurer is not liable un til each of the underlying insurers has paid the 
full amount of the “underlying limits of liability” (as defined  in their policies). Finally, the provision 
indicates that if underlying limits are reduced or exhausted, t he policy will pay excess of these reduced or 
exhausted limits but only after th e retention applicable to the  primary policy has been satisfied. 
   
84 Exhaustion/Depletion of Underlying Limits Provision 
All excess D&O policies contain a provision stating that the un derlying policies must be exhausted before 
the excess insurer has any liab ility for payment of loss.  
There are four rationales underlying this type of provision. 
1. To ensure that the excess insurer is not being requested to dro p down to assume loss that it did 
not bargain to accept. 
2. To be sure that the professional claims department and/or couns el of the primary insurer has 
evaluated the claim, analyzing such issues as coverage, allocat ion, and the application of 
exclusions. (Although these findings may not be binding on the excess insurer, excess insurers 
generally rely on the work done by the primary insurer.)  
3. To be certain that its place in t he queues of insurers is not v iolated, an insurer will not be forced 
to pay a loss when there is an i nsurer having a greater obligat ion to pay the loss still available to 
the insureds.  
4. In the case of “duty to defend” policies, to avoid a premature demand for defense of a claim. 
(However, this is not applicable to most D&O claim situations, since the majority of D&O 
policies written with excess cove rage do not involve a duty to defend.)  
Strict versus Liberal Exhaustion of  Limits Provisions: A Case Study 
Excess insurers use different polic y language to define “exhaus tion”—some of which is worse for the 
insured than others.  
Facts of the Case 
In Qualcomm, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London , 161 Cal. App. 4th 184, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
770 (Ct. App. 4th Dist. 2008), emp loyees sued Qualcomm over iss ues related to their stock options. 
Qualcomm settled the stock option litigation, incurring $28.6 m illion in defense and indemnity costs. 
Qualcomm had a $20 million primary D&O policy with AIG and an e xcess D&O policy with Lloyd’s. 
Qualcomm settled its coverage claim under the AIG policy for $1 6 million. This was the most AIG 
agreed to pay as respects the claim. Since Qualcomm was willing  to absorb the next $4 million in costs 
between the $16 million AIG settle ment and the $20 million atta chment point of the excess coverage, it 
only sought excess coverage for about $8.6 million from Lloyd’s . (Note: According to what Qualcomm  
thought  were the terms of the Lloyd’s  excess policy, that policy would  not afford coverage until $20 
million had been paid out within the primary layer—whether by t he primary insurer and/or by Qualcomm. 
In effect, Qualcomm believed that it needed to self-insure the $4 million settlement “gap” so it could 
access the Lloyd’s excess policy.) 
Unfortunately for Qualcomm, the  Lloyd’s excess policy had a ver y strict exhaustion provision that read, 
“Underwriters shall be liable onl y after the insurers under eac h of the Underlying Policies [the AIG 
policy, in this instance] have paid or have been held liable to  pay the full amount of the Underlying Limit 
of Liability.” 
The Court’s Ruling 
The appellate court held that Qu alcomm was not entitled to exce ss coverage. Nothing in the Lloyd’s 
exhaustion provision was ambiguous. It clearly required either that (1) AIG “has paid” the full amount of 
the $20 million primary limit or (2) that AIG has been “held li able to pay” the full amount of the $20 
million underlying limit. Neither of those events occurred. AIG  actually paid only $16 million out of its 
$20 million underlying limit. AIG  was not “held liable” by a ju dge or jury. Even read ing the phrase “held 
liable to pay” as meaning being obligated to pay under a settle ment, in this case, the settlement only  
85 required AIG to pay $16 million out of the $20 million underlyi ng limit. Since the terms of the strict 
exhaustion provision were not ful filled, the court held that Qu alcomm forfeited around $8.6 million in 
excess coverage. 
The real problem in the Qualcomm  case was that the exhaustion p rovision restricted who was allowed to 
pay the underlying limit. The pla in terms of the Lloyd’s policy  said that only the underlying insurer  was 
allowed to pay. This language sim ply did not grant the insured a contractual right to absorb any portion of 
the settlement costs within the primary layer. 
A Better Alternative 
There are other, more liberal, versions of policy language rega rding exhaustion of primary coverage that 
would have better suited the insu red in the Qualcomm case. Spec ifically, some excess D&O policies 
expressly permit the insured to p ay a portion of the underlying  limit. For example, one popular excess 
D&O insurer’s policy contains a n exhaustion provision condition  that reads, “[L]iability for any covered 
Loss with respect to Claims first  made in each Policy Year shal l attach to the Insurer only after [1] the 
insurers of the Underlying Policies, [2] the Insured and/or [3] the Insured Pers ons shall have paid, in the 
applicable legal currency, the full amount of the Underlying Li mit for such Policy Year.” Under this 
language, the “Insured” has the r ight to contribute payment tow ard the underlying limit, which the excess 
insurer will deem satisfied as long as the full amount is paid by any combination of the three listed 
parties.  
The Lesson of the Case 
If the language specifies that only the primary insurer can pay  the underlying limit, it is wise to negotiate 
a more liberal exhaustion provision giving the insured the cont ractual right to absorb a portion of 
settlement costs without fo rfeiting excess coverage.  
Maintenance of Underlying Policies Provision 
Of utmost importance to an excess insurer are (1) the existence  of the underlying insurance and (2) the 
solvency of the underlying insurers. The purpose of this provis ion is to protect the excess insurer in the 
event that any of the underlying insurers’ policies expire or a re canceled yet not replaced with comparable 
coverage. In such instances, and in the absence of the maintena nce of underlying insurance provision, an 
affected excess insurer would ot herwise be liable for loss that  these underlying policies would no longer 
cover. However, since the excess insurer’s premium was predicat ed on the existence of a specific amount 
of underlying coverage, it woul d be inequitable for the excess insurer to bear such loss.  
Two Versions of the Maintenance of Underlying Policies Provision 
There are two versions of the maintenance of underlying insuran ce provision.  
Restrictive Version 
Under the restrictive version, if an underlying policy is cance led or its limits are otherwise impaired (e.g., 
by means of insurer insolvency) , the excess policy above it aut omatically terminates. In the example 
discussed above, assume the primary insurer writing the $5 mill ion of coverage becomes insolvent and is 
no longer able to pay claims. The first excess policy above it provides an additional $10 million limit, but 
the form contains a restrictive version of the maintenance of u nderlying limits provision. In this situation, 
the $10 million excess policy would automatically terminate, an d the insured would have neither primary 
coverage nor the cove rage under the first excess policy availab le.  
86 Favorable Version 
In contrast, under the favorable version of the maintenance of underlying insurance provision found 
within excess D&O policy forms, i f an underlying policy is canc eled or its limits become impaired (in 
this instance, by the primary in surer’s insolvency), the excess  policy above it will not automatically 
terminate. Rather, the excess po licy applies as if the policyho lder were self-insured for the underlying 
layer (i.e., the excess policy will not “drop down”). In the pr evious claim example, if the primary insurer 
became insolvent, the first excess insurer’s policy would remai n in force, subject to a $6 million self-
insured retention ($5 million policy limit + $1 million retenti on).  
Implications of the Maintenance of Underlying Insurance Provision 
Given the significant functional difference between the favorab le and restrictive versions of the 
maintenance of underlying provisi ons, it is a critical point of  differentiation between excess D&O 
policies. Accordingly, when putting together an excess D&O prog ram, the restrictive version of the 
maintenance of underlying limits provision should be avoided. I f it cannot, such policy(ies) should be 
placed as high as possible in the insured’s “tower of coverage. ” 
A follow form excess policy adopts the exclusions in the immedi ately underlying policy. Accordingly, in 
the example that has been used  throughout this section on exces s D&O policies, the second excess D&O 
policy would adopt any additional exclusions found in the first  excess D&O policy, and the first excess 
policy would adopt any additional exclusions found in the prima ry policy.  
If an excess D&O policy contains additional exclusions, this wo uld be to the insured’s disadvantage. 
Accordingly, such policies shoul d be avoided whenever possible.  If, however, this cannot be arranged, 
such policies should be placed on the top layer of an excess D& O program to minimize the probability of 
involving that policy in a claim  situation. Otherwise, insurers  providing higher laye rs of excess coverage 
would probably automatically  adopt these added exclusions.  
“Blended” or “Integr ated” Excess Policies 
In addition to excess D&O policies , which apply to a single typ e of coverage, a number of insurers offer 
what are known as “blended” or “i ntegrated” excess policies tha t apply as excess coverage over a variety 
of claims-made policies. These policies include D&O liability, EPL, and fiduciary liability. 
Blended excess policies are writte n with a single aggregate pol icy limit for all coverages combined. The 
terms and conditions of such for ms are generally similar to tho se found in excess D&O forms, except for 
those changes required to accommodate multiple coverages. 
Under blended excess policies, if losses other than D&O losses exhaust the aggregate policy limit, there 
will be no coverage left for D&O claims other than what is avai lable in underlying policies. On the other 
hand, for the same amount of tota l premium dollars that might b e paid for individual excess policies, a 
much higher aggregate limit for the entire group of coverages w ill probably be availa ble under a blended 
excess policy.  
The question then becomes whethe r it is better to have a rigid wall around the D&O policy to protect only 
the directors and officers or to have the flexibility to apply the excess coverage where it is needed when 
other types of losses (i.e., employment practices, fiduciary, o r crime) occur. Exhibit 9.3 illustrates the 
manner in which integrated excess policies function.  
87 Exhibit 9.3 
Operation of an Integrated Excess Policy 
 
 
In this diagram, an aggregate limit of $25 million in coverage is provided under the integrated excess 
policy. The policy functions ex actly like an umbrella policy, p roviding $25 million in excess coverage 
over the three underlying policies— in any combination—whenever any of the limits of any of the 
underlying policies is exhausted.  
Two Examples 
In Option 1 shown on the left, the insured has allocated $20 mi llion of the excess cove rage to apply over 
the EPL policy to cover a very large EPL claim, which leaves on ly $5 million of the aggregate limit 
available, which can be applied over the other policies, such a s the D&O policy. In Option 2 shown on the 
right, the insured has allocated $10 million of the excess cove rage to the EPL policy, $5 million of the 
excess coverage to the D&O polic y, and $10 million of the exces s coverage to the fiduciary liability 
policy. 
In a like manner, the insured has the flexibility to use the $2 5 million aggregate limit in any fashion to 
respond to large claims filed un der any of the three underlying  policies. 
  
 
88 Notices Required To Be Given to the Excess Insurer 
Most excess policies contain some sort of “Required Notices” pr ovision, which calls for the insured to 
notify the excess insurer of certa in key events. Below are five  events to which these provisions typically 
apply. 
 Cancellation of any underlying insurance 
 Change in the terms, conditions , limitations, or exclusions of the “followed” policy 
 Any notice of claim or any “inc ident” that might give rise to a  claim under the underlying 
insurance 
 Any claim payment or settlement offer the insured intends to ma ke, even if the amount does not 
impact the excess insurer’s layer of coverage 
 Any additional or return premiums, due or returned by the under lying insurers

C. This answer is incorrect. The in surer should be notified of any  incident that might give rise to a 
claim under the underlying insurance. 
D. This answer is incorrect. This transaction is probably innocuou s, but the insurer should still be 
notified of any additional or ret urn premiums due or returned b y the underlying insurers.

D&O Insurance for Privately Held Companies 
Overview 
Chapter 10 examines the distinct  policy forms that are availabl e to cover the exposures faced by privately 
held companies.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
1. identify the typical policy features that distinguish private c ompany D&O forms from those 
offered to publicly traded organizations. 
Distinctive Aspects of Private Co mpany D&O Coverage Forms 
There are several key differences between the two kinds of form s written to cover privately held 
companies and publicly traded organizations. These differences are discussed below. 
Packaged Approach 
The vast majority of D&O coverage  written for privately held fi rms is made available on a so-called 
package basis. That is, in additio n to offering standard D&O co verage, nearly all of the policies also 
provide coverage for EPL, fiducia ry, and crime exposures, all o f which many privately held companies 
are highly susceptible to. In addition, some policies designed for private companies also afford the option 
to purchase kidnap/ransom coverage (also termed “special crime”  coverage) and miscellaneous 
professional liability insurance (covering corporate accountant s and attorneys, for example). 
It should be noted, however, that many particularly large priva te companies likely will not have the option 
of utilizing a packaged format. Private companies with more tha n 250 employees or more than $100 
million in annual sales generally m ust use an unbundled approac h.  
   
93 Exhibit 10.1 details some of the  general advantages of covering  private company exposures in a packaged 
format. 
Exhibit 10.1 
Advantages of a Packaged Approach 
Lower premium Insureds can ex pect an approximate 5 percent 
discount for each line of c overage when they buy more 
than one type of policy within a packaged format, compared to purchasing three separate policies. 
Ease of Administration Package policies require only a single a pplication, 
rather than multiple applic ations, a fact that reduces 
an insured's administrative effort. This approach also 
benefits a private company insured because the 
person handling the administration process  
need only deal with one insurer and review a single insurance policy after the insurer issues it. 
Common Policy Provisions The three major coverage lines (D&O, E PL, and 
fiduciary) are almost always subject to a set of 
“common” policy provisions ( e.g., cancellation, notice 
of claim requirements) . This has the effect  
of minimizing potential coverage disputes and 
coverage gaps. 
Unified Claims Management When buying a package policy, the cla ims handling 
process is streamlined, reim bursements to the insured 
will follow more quickly, a nd coverage disputes will be 
minimized, compared to claim situations involving multiple insurers. 
Flexibility in Limits and Retentions 
Another advantage of the package format is that (in contrast to  what is made available by insurers of 
publicly held companies) most wr iters of private company D&O po licies offer a great deal of flexibility in 
the selection of limits and reten tions for the various coverage s. Insurers usually offer either separate or 
combined limits for each of these different types of coverage a s well as either separate or combined 
retentions for each of them.  
For example, under a typical pack age approach, an insured could  elect a combined single limit applying 
to D&O, employment practices, and fiduciary liability coverage.  Or the insured could select a separate 
limit for each of these coverages. The same can usually be said  for the selection of retentions for each of 
these coverages. That is, the ins ured could opt for a separate retention for each type of coverage or a 
single retention annual aggregate for all coverages.  
Broad “Insured Persons” Coverage 
Unlike corporate D&O policies, whereby only directors and offic ers are “insured persons,” private 
company policies cover a much broader range of individuals. Spe cifically, employees (both full- and part-
time) are also insureds under the forms. 
   
94 Broad Entity Coverage 
Unlike insurers of publicly held companies, insurers who write privately held firms provide entity 
coverage for all kinds of claims—not just those involving secur ities. Moreover, entity coverage is 
automatic under D&O policies for private companies, whereas, un der corporate D&O forms, entity 
coverage always requires paymen t of additional premium to purch ase Coverage C. 
Duty To Defend 
Virtually all D&O policies for private companies are written on  a duty to defend basis. In contrast, the 
vast majority of forms written for publicly traded firms state that the insurer has no duty to defend, only a 
duty to pay defense costs and make indemnity payments.  
However, the duty to defend approach is usually better suited t o privately held firms because they tend to 
be smaller and less familiar with the complexities of D&O litig ation. It is usually best  to allow the insurer 
to manage and control the litig ation process when private compa nies are involved, c ompared with the 
larger, publicly traded compani es that tend to have sizeable le gal staffs and are more comfortable 
controlling the litigation process associated with D&O claims. 
Liberal Cancellation and Nonrenewal Provisions 
The cancellation and nonrenewal provisions in private company D &O policies tend to be more liberal 
than those found in their for-profit counterparts. Specifically , a majority of such forms are written on a 
noncancelable basis (except for nonpayment of premium). In cont rast, a significant number of for-profit 
D&O forms require only 30 to 60 days’ notice prior to cancellat ion.  
In addition, most private company forms require the insurer to provide 30 to 60 days’ notice prior to 
nonrenewing, compared to corporat e D&O insurers whose forms gen erally do not require any prior notice 
of nonrenewal. 
Broad ERPs 
The ERPs found in private company  D&O forms are usually somewha t broader than those made available 
by corporate D&O writers. For example, private company forms ty pically offer ERPs of 1 year for a 
maximum of 125 percent of the e xpiring premium and in some case s as low as 50 percent of the expiring 
premium. Conversely, corporate D& O insurers’ ERP premiums are u sually a minimum of 100 percent of 
expiring premium and can be as high as 200 percent of the expir ing premium. In addition, insurers of 
privately held companies frequent ly offer ERPs of more than 1 y ear and for as long a period as 5 years. 
   
95 Key Provisions in Private Company D&O Policy Forms (and How To 
Modify Them) 
This section will discuss six of the most important provisions found in private company D&O forms and 
how they should be written to maximize coverage for the insured .  
Exhibit 10.2 lists the provi sions that will be discussed. 
Exhibit 10.2 
Key Provisions in Private Company D&O Policies 
 Insured versus Insured Exclusion 
 Major Shareholder Exclusion 
 Family Exclusion 
 Increased Coverage Limits fo r Directors and Officers 
 Breach of Contract Exclusion 
 Securities Claim Exclusion 
Insured versus Insured Exclusion 
As discussed previously, the insur ed versus insured exclusion e liminates coverage for claims by one 
insured against another. There  is one important reason why the insured versus insured exclusion is 
especially problematic in private company D&O policies. Unlike D&O policies written to cover public 
companies, whereby only directors and officers are insureds, pr ivate company D&O forms cover 
“everyone” who is associated with the company (e.g., employees,  managers, stockholders, volunteers). 
Thus, a claim made by any of th e broad range of insureds would be excluded by the “insured versus 
insured exclusion.” As a conseque nce, a number of “garden varie ty” claims will be excluded by a private 
company D&O policy, unless the in sured versus exclusion is modi fied. Such claims most notably include 
EPL claims and whistleblower claims. This is because most claim s of both types are usually brought by 
employees against  directors and officers. 
Given this situation, the insured versus insured exclusion shou ld be modified so that it excepts, and thus 
covers, employment claims and wh istleblower claims. Wording sho uld also be modified so as to not 
preclude claims involving (a) retired directors and officers, ( b) employees, and (c) bankruptcy trustees.  
Major Shareholder Exclusion 
The major shareholder exclusion eliminates coverage for claims brought by persons who own a certain 
percentage (or more) of the total outstanding shares of a priva tely held company. Specifically, the 
exclusionary threshold typically ranges from a low of 5 percent  to a high of 15 percent. 
Unlike most types of exclusions, which are found within “regula r” policy wording, the major shareholder 
exclusion is almost always adde d as an exclusionary endorsement . 
Interestingly, the major sharehol der exclusion is one of the on ly significant restrictions found within 
private company D&O policies that is not also contained within the D&O f orms written to cover publicly 
traded companies. Public company  D&O policies generally do not contain a major shareholder exclusion 
because the vast majority of pub licly held businesses are so la rge that (usually) no one person owns 5 
percent or more of its shares. I n contrast, with private compan ies, a single individual almost always owns 
more than 5 percent of its shar es. In fact, it is not uncommon for one person to own all the shares of a 
private company.  
96 Given the fact that the major shareholder exclusion could poten tially eliminate coverage for numerous 
claims, insureds should first atte mpt to have the exclusion rem oved. Alternatively, underwriters may be 
amenable to increasing the threshold percentage, either from 5 percent to 10 percent or from 10 percent to 
15 percent. Although these changes usually require payment of a dditional premium, insureds should 
weigh the benefits against the c osts and consider requesting su ch modifications. 
Family Exclusion 
The family exclusion precludes claims made by one family member /owner against another family 
member/owner. Again, like the in sured versus insured exclusion,  the intent of the family exclusion is to 
preclude coverage for claims invol ving either collusion or infi ghting. However, there are foreseeable 
situations in which this exclusi on could operate to eliminate c overage where neither of these events is 
occurring. Most often, this happe ns where, for example, a son s ues a father, alleging mismanagement of 
the family business. In such a s ituation, neither collusion nor  infighting is the source of the claim, and, 
thus, the claim s hould be covered. 
The most effective means of modifying the family exclusion is t o request that only claims from members 
of the same generation  should be excluded. The effect  of this modification would ther efore be to allow 
coverage if, for instance, a son were to sue a grandfather, or a daughter were to sue a father. In addition, 
the exclusion should not apply a nd coverage should be provided where ownership of the plaintiff’s shares 
of stock are held in a family trust.  
In the latter instance, it is likely that the younger generatio n will not have control of the business and yet 
may be suing to prevent gross mi smanagement of a family busines s, a scenario that is different from the 
possibility of collusion or infighting that underwriters attemp t to avoid with this exclusion. 
Increased Coverage Limits fo r Directors and Officers 
Although “everyone” is an insured under a private company D&O p olicy, it is apparent that not everyone 
at most private companies has th e same level of exposure. There fore, it is usually prudent to secure 
additional coverage limits for a  private company’s directors an d officers. Accordingly, insurers of 
privately held companies all ow such businesses to buy separate and additional limits that apply only to 
the company’s directors and officers.  
For example, assume a private company D&O policy is written wit h a $1 million aggregate limit. 
Consideration should be given to buying an additional “dedicate d” limit applying only to directors and 
officers of $1 million or perhaps $2 million.  
Breach of Contract Exclusion 
Despite the expansive nature of private company D&O policies, o ne important “gap” is the exclusion for 
breach of contracts. The rationale  for this exclusion is that t he underwriters only intend to cover claims 
involving duties imposed by law, such as the common law duties of diligence, obedience, and loyalty, 
which are required of a corpora tion’s directors and officers. I n contrast, the breach of a contract is 
considered to involve the breach of a personal, voluntarily ass umed obligation and is therefore excluded 
by many private company D&O policy forms. 
The breach of contract exclusion should use “for” language; mea ning the exclusion should only apply 
“for breach of contract.” However , a number of private company D&O forms employ the more expansive 
“arising out of, or in any way related or attributable to breac h of contract” wording. This language could 
be used by an insurer to exclude coverage for an excessive rang e of claim scenarios. On the other hand, 
an insurer would have a much mo re difficult time denying covera ge if a private company D&O policy 
used “for” breach of contract language.   
97 An Example 
A private company’s D&O policy is written with a breach of cont ract exclusion that uses a preamble 
precluding coverage “arising out of, or in any way related or a ttributable to breach of contract.” The 
company is sued by a bank that a lleges the company has defaulte d on a loan. Under these circumstances, 
the insurer will have a much better chance of being able to den y coverage for the claim, rather than if the 
breach of contract exclusion were written with the more favorab le (for the insured) “for breach of 
contract” preamble.  
Securities Claims Exclusion 
A number of private company D&O  forms exclude coverage for secu rities claims. The rationale for the 
exclusion is that because privat e companies do not usually issu e securities to the public, such firms have 
no exposure to securities claims. However, private companies do  in fact have a securities claims 
exposure. Although they do not issue equity securities  to the public, larger p rivately held companies 
sometimes issue debt securities  (i.e., bonds) to the public. In addition, private firms occasi onally issue 
equity securities to small groups of private investors in what are known as private placements.  
Furthermore, although private com panies are not required to reg ister private placements or debt securities 
with the SEC, they are still required to comply with US securit ies laws. 
Given this clear exposure to securities litigation, the securit ies exclusion should contain three specific 
modifications.  
Coverage for Exempt Securities Offerings 
First, the exclusion should “except,” and thus cover,  claims involving securities that are exempt from 
registration under the Securities Act of 1933. This is necessar y because, even though private companies 
need not register bond issues or p rivate placements with the SE C, such companies still have an exposure 
from these activities because priv ate firms must nevertheless c omply with US securities laws.  
Coverage for Failure To Go Public 
Second, the securities exclusion should be modified so that it includes coverage for claims alleging 
“failure to go public.” This wo rding is also necessary because individuals are often induced to invest in a 
private company based on the assu rance that the organization wi ll “go public” in the near future. This 
provides a significant incentiv e for investors, because a publi c stock offering usually brings with it 
substantial return for the origi nal owners of such a company. H owever, numerous lawsuits alleging 
“securities fraud” have been filed because the private company never offered its shares to the public. 
Coverage for Offerings of Securities 
Third, the securities exclusion sh ould provide that if the insu red decides to offer shares to the public (and 
thus convert from a privately held to a publicly held business) , the insured can notify the insurer 30 days 
prior to the public offering and receive a proposal for coverag e of claims arising from the public offering. 
It should be noted that the insu rer will have the right to impo se additional terms and conditions and 
charge extra premium for s uch coverage and will not be obligated  to provide an actual quotation.

A. combined single limit for all coverages. 
B. separate limits for each coverage. 
C. separate retention for each coverage. 
D. waiver of underlying insurance. 
2. The officers of Fox Hole, a private company, are reluctant to i nform their insurer of a possible

4. All shares in the Dump Hotel corporation are owned by members o f the Dump family: Donna 
Dump, Ivan Dump, Erica Dump, and Fanny Dump. What exclusion tha t is often added to 
directors and officers (D&O) policies on privately held compani es should be eliminated from the

100 Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Insure rs usually offer combined limit s. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Insure rs usually offer separate limit s for each type of coverage. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The in sured is usually offered a sele ction of separate re tentions for each 
coverage or a single retention annual aggregate for all coverag es. 
D. That’s correct! Under a typical  packaged policy, Paper Clips wo uld not have the option of a 
waiver of underlying insurance. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! A majority of pr ivate company D& O policies are written on a noncancelable basis, 
except that the insurer may can cel for nonpayment of premium. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The policy may only be canceled for a  different reason. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Public company forms generally do not  require any prior notice. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The permissible reasons for cancellat ion are very limited. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Cooking per se does not generally lea d to D&O claims. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Garden-variety is a broad, nonspecifi c term. The exclusion should be 
modified to except specific type s of garden-variety claims. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. Although Peter Piper was an employee,  the underlying complaint did not 
involve an emplo yment practice. 
D. That’s correct! The exclusion sh ould be modified to except, and  therefore cover, whistleblower 
claims. The wording should also be modified so as not to preclu de claims that involve employees 
such as Piper. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. “For” language is a better approach t o this exclusion than other wording 
that is commonly used. 
B. That’s correct! A major sharehol der exclusion would eliminate c overage for claims brought by 
persons who own more than some p ercentage, usually between 5 an d 15 percent of the company. 
This provision would preclude cov erage for claims  brought by on e if not all of the Dump family 
members. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Most D&O policies have this exclusion , and there is nothing unique 
about the Dump corporation that m akes it a problem. However, an y business in the hospitality 
industry should be careful to avoid violation of the Fair Labor  Standards Act and other guidelines. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Although the Dump relatives could fig ht with one another, a family feud 
would not trigger a typical war exclusion. 
   
101 5.  
A. That’s correct! A major shareholder exclusion might eliminate c overage for many claims that 
would otherwise be covered. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Even t hough private co mpanies like Ka u Pi need not register bond issues 
or private placements with the S ecurities and Exchange Commissi on, they still have an exposure 
from these activities. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Nume rous lawsuits alleging securities  fraud have been filed because a 
private company never offered its shares to the public. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. The securities exclusion should provi de that, if Kau Pi decides to convert 
from a privately held to a publicly held business, the insured can notify the insurer 30 days prior to 
the public offering and receive a p roposal for coverage of clai ms arising from the public offering; 
the insurer is therefore obligated to provide an actual quotati on.  
102 Glossary 
1934 SEC Act —See Securities Exchange Act. 
Allocation —(1) The assignment to individual policies of the obligation to  defend or indemnify an insured 
when injury or damage has o ccurred during a succession of polic y periods. (2) The determination of 
which elements of defense costs must be paid by the insurer and  which elements may be subject to 
reimbursement by the insured, depending on covered and noncover ed elements of the suit or claim 
brought against the insured. Some  courts have ruled that an ins urer is not obligated to pay the cost of 
defending noncovered elements of a claim. 
arbitration —Referral of a dispute to an impa rtial third party chosen by th e parties in the dispute who 
agree in advance to abide by the arbitrator’s award issued afte r a hearing at which both parties have a 
chance to be heard. 
arbitration clause —Language providing a means of resolving differences between a reinsurer and the 
reinsured (or an insurer and an insured) without litigation. Us ually, each party appoints an arbiter. The 
two arbiters select a third, or an umpire, and a majority decis ion of the three becomes binding on the 
parties in the arbitration proceedings. 
bad faith —A term describing blatantly unfair conduct that exceeds mere n egligence by an insurance 
company. For example, a bad faith  claim may arise if an auto li ability insurer arbitrarily refuses to settle a 
claim within policy limits, where an insured’s liability is inc ontrovertible. Bad faith damages, also known 
as extracontractual damages, are  often substantial. They freque ntly exceed the limits of the insurance 
policy that is the subject of the claim.  
best efforts allocation provisions —Both insurer and insured prom ise to use their “best efforts” i n 
apportioning covered claim amount s, based on the relative legal  exposures of the parties and based on the 
type(s) of claims made. 
claims-made and reported policy —A type of claims-made policy in w hich a claim must be both mad e 
against the insured and reported to the insurer during the poli cy period for coverage to apply. Claims-
made and reported policies are unf avorable from the insured’s s tandpoint because it is sometimes difficult 
to report a claim to an insurer during a policy period if the c laim is made late in that policy period. 
However, more liberal versions of claims-made and reported poli cies provide post-policy “windows,” 
which allow insureds to report cl aims to the insurer within 30 to 60 days following policy expiration. 
claims-made policy —A policy providing coverage tha t is triggered when a claim is made against the 
insured during the policy period, regardless of when the wrongf ul act that gave rise to the claim took 
place. (The one exception is when a retroactive date is applica ble to a claims-made policy. In such 
instances, the wrongful act that gave rise to the claim must ha ve taken place on or after the retroactive 
date.) Most professional, errors and omissions (E&O), directors  and officers (D&O), and employment 
practices liability insurance ( EPLI) is written as claims-made policies.  
coinsurance (in D&O insurance) —In a directors and officers (D&O) policy, the coinsurance prov ision 
is similar to the co-payment pr ovisions found in medical insura nce coverage, in whic h the policy will pay 
only a specified portion (typica lly 80 to 95 percent) of each l oss in excess of the dollar amount deductible. 
   
103 corporate reimbursement coverage —Coverage under a directors and officers (D&O) liability policy  
covering the corporate organization’s obligation to indemnify i ts directors and officers for claims 
resulting from their acts in conjunction with the organization.  This obligation is usually stated in either 
the corporate charter or the corporate bylaws and in some cases  is mandated by state s tatute. The coverage 
provided by this section of a D&O  policy is also referred to as  “Side B” coverage. 
D&O —directors and officers 
D&O policy —See Directors and officers liability insurance. 
defense within limits —A liability policy provision a ccording to which amounts paid b y the insurer to 
defend the insured against a claim or suit reduce the policy’s applicable limit of insurance. General 
liability policies are ordinarily not subject to such a provisi on, although the standard  commercial general 
liability (CGL) policy provides for defense of the named insure d’s indemnitee “within limits” when the 
named insured has a contractual obligation to provide such a de fense. Defense within limits is more 
common in professional liability policies.  
derivative lawsuit —A type of lawsuit brought by one  or more stockholders, on beha lf of the corporation, 
alleging financial loss to the o rganization. The alleged harm m ust be to the corporation as a whole, such 
as the diminishing of the corporation’s assets, for shareholder s to pursue an action derivatively. Any 
recovery in such suits inures to the benefit of the corporation  itself as opposed to the shareholders who 
institute the action. 
directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance —A type of liability insurance covering directors and 
officers for claims made against them while serving on a board of directors and/or as an officer. D&O 
liability insurance can be written to cover the directors and o fficers of for-profit businesses, privately held 
firms, not-for-profit organiza tions, and educational institutio ns. In effect, the policies function as 
“management errors and omissions  liability insurance,” covering  claims resulting from managerial 
decisions that have adverse fina ncial consequences. The policie s contain “shrinking limits” provisions, 
meaning that defense costs—which are often a substantial part o f a claim—reduce the policy’s limits. 
This approach contrasts with co mmercial general liability (CGL)  policies, in which defense is covered in 
addition to policy limits. Other distinctive features of D&O po licies are that they (a) are written on a 
claims-made basis, (b) usually c ontain no explicit duty to defe nd the insureds (when  covering for-profit 
businesses), and (c) cover monetary  damages but exclude bodily injury (BI) and property damage (PD). 
discovery provision —Provisions that permit insureds to report incidents or circums tances that may result 
in claims in the future, found mainly in professional liability  insurance policies written with claims-made 
coverage triggers. Discovery pr ovisions, which are also known a s “awareness” or “notice of potential 
claim” provisions, allow an insured to lock in coverage for suc h events so that coverage will apply under 
the current claims-made policy, regardless of how far in the fu ture a claim is eventually made in 
conjunction with the incident that has been reported. 
duty to defend —A term used to describe an insur er’s obligation to provide an insured with defense to 
claims made under a liability ins urance policy. As a general ru le, an insured need only establish that there 
is potential for coverage under a policy to give rise to the in surer’s duty to defend. Therefore, the duty to 
defend may exist even where cove rage is in doubt and ultimately  does not apply. Implicit in this rule is 
the principle that an insurer’s duty to defend an insured is br oader than its duty to indemnify. Moreover, 
an insurer may owe a duty to def end its insured against a claim  in which ultimately no damages are 
awarded, and any doubt as to whether the facts support a duty t o defend is usually resolved in the 
insured’s favor. 
   
104 With respect to directors and officers (D&O) and employment pra ctices liability insurance (EPLI) 
policies, policies containing explicit “duty to defend” wording  obligate an insurer to assume control of the 
claim defense process, including  selecting counsel and paying l egal bills. In contrast, non-duty to defend 
(or duty to pay) policies require only that the insurer reimbur se the insured for funds expended by the 
insured in defending a claim. 
employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) —A type of liability insurance covering wrongful acts 
arising from the employment process. The most frequent types of  claims covered under such policies 
include wrongful termination, di scrimination, sexual harassment , and retaliation. In a ddition, the policies 
cover claims from a variety of other types of inappropriate wor kplace conduct, including (but not limited 
to) employment-related defamation, invasion of privacy, failure  to promote, deprivation of a career 
opportunity, and negligent evalua tion. The policies cover direc tors and officers, management personnel, 
and employees as insureds. The most common exclusions are for b odily injury (BI), property damage 
(PD), and intentional/dishonest acts. EPLI policies are written  on a claims-made basis. The forms contain 
“shrinking limits” provisions, meaning that insurer payment of defense costs—which are often a 
substantial part of a claim—reduces the policy’s limits. This a pproach contrasts with commercial general 
liability (CGL) policies, in whic h defense is covered in additi on to policy limits. Although EPLI is 
available as a stand-alone covera ge, it is also frequently sold  as part of a manage ment liability package 
policy. In addition to providing directors and officers (D&O) a nd fiduciary liability insurance, 
management liability package polic ies afford the option to cove r employment practices liability (EPL). 
entity coverage —Affords direct coverage of the insured organization under a di rectors and officers 
(D&O) liability policy. Typically, c orporate D&O forms only rei mburse the insured organization when it 
is legally obligated to indemnify corporate officers and direct ors for their acts on behalf of the 
organization. However, if a lawsuit specifically names the insu red organization as a defendant, the 
standard D&O policy does not pr ovide coverage. Entity coverage,  which until recent years was only 
provided under D&O policies written for nonprofit organizations  and healthcare institutions, is designed 
to cover the organization directly in addition to its directors  and officers. A number of corporate D&O 
forms will now provide an entity coverage endorsement for an ad ditional premium.  
EPL —employment practices liability. 
EPLI —See Employment practices liability insurance. 
ERP —See Extended reporting period. 
extended reporting period (ERP) —A designated time period after a claims-made policy has expire d 
during which a claim may be mad e and coverage triggered as if t he claim had been made during the 
policy period.  
extradition —The process by which one country  transfers a suspected or conv icted criminal to another 
country. 
final adjudication —The point at which the insure d director/officer is acquitted o r convicted or the claim 
is settled. 
financial restatement —A publicly traded corporation’s material revision to one of it s recently released 
earning statements, usually in a manner indicating that profits  were lower or losses were larger than 
originally reported. 
first-dollar defense coverage —A coverage feature of some liability policies in which retenti ons do not 
apply to defense costs, even if n o indemnity payments are made in conjunction with a claim. Thus, if an 
insurer were to expend $10,000 on defense of a claim and nothin g for indemnity, the insured would not be 
required to pay any out-of-pocket costs for defense.  
105 first-made language —Policy wording to the effect t hat coverage will apply only whe n the claim has not 
previously been made in connecti on with a prior policy written by the current insurer or a different 
insurer. 
full prior acts coverage —A type of claims-made liability policy that does not contain a  retroactive date 
and therefore covers claims arising from acts that took place a t any time prior to the inception date of the 
policy—regardless of how far in the past. For example, assume t hat an insured has a claims-made policy 
that includes a January 1, 2000, retroactive date and a January  1, 2010–2011, term. If a claim is made 
against the insured on July 1, 2010, and the claim arose from a  wrongful act that took place on January 1, 
1998, there would be no coverage  under the policy. This is beca use the wrongful act took place prior to 
the January 1, 2000, retroactive date. Now assume that another insured has a policy written with the same 
January 1, 2010–2011, policy term, but the policy contains no r etroactive date. If a claim were made 
against the insured on July 1, 2010, from a wrongful act that t ook place on January 1 , 1998, coverage 
would apply because the absence of  a retroactive date means tha t, regardless of how far in the past a 
wrongful act giving rise to a claim took place, the claim will be covered (as long as it is made against the 
insured during the policy period). Full prior acts coverage is most likely to be granted when an applicant 
already has coverage in place at  the time it submits an applica tion. On the other hand, underwriters 
generally do not provide full pr ior acts coverage to insureds t hat have not previous ly purchased liability 
insurance. This is because underwriters sometimes believe that an applicant’s desire to buy coverage at 
this juncture may be motivated by the applicant’s intention to report a claim under the new policy.  
full severability provision —Provision in a directors and officers (D&O) policy application  that 
knowledge of either the signer of  the application or certain ex ecutive officers is not imputed to any other 
insureds, and, thus, such innocen t persons will have coverage d espite the application’s false statement or 
knowledge about the false statement. 
IDL coverage —A variation on Side A-only policies providing directors and of ficers (D&O) liability 
coverage for independent directors only. 
initial public offering (IPO) —The process of selling stock in a corporation for the first ti me to the 
general public. IPOs are handled by investment banking firms, w hich study the corporation’s financial 
situation and then decide how m any shares of stock should be so ld and at what price. Individual investors 
are sometimes shut out of IPOs because investment bankers typic ally dole out IPO shares to institutional 
customers, such as mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and insu rance companies. Accordingly, IPOs 
have received particular attention in recent years because clas s action lawsuits against corporate directors 
and officers have arisen in conjunction with the way in which t he IPOs were allocated among various 
parties. Such claims are known as IPO laddering claims.  
integrated excess policies —Excess insurance policies that can apply as additional coverag e over one or 
more different types of primary liability policies, which are u sually, but not always , written on a claims-
made basis. Integrated excess policies are also known as “flexi ble excess” policies and most often apply 
as excess coverage over directors and officers (D&O), employmen t practices liability (EPL), and 
fiduciary liability po licies. Integrated excess policies are wr itten with a single, aggregate limit for all of 
the underlying coverages to which the policy applies. 
intentional torts —A category civil wrongs resulting from an intentional act by t he wrongdoer 
(tortfeasor).  
IPO—See Initial public offering. 
   
106 limited severability provision —A provision in an application for directors and officers (D&O)  liability 
insurance stating that knowledge  possessed by any insured perso ns, other than the signer of the 
application or certain executiv e officers (usually the CEO, COO , and CFO), will not be imputed to other 
insureds in a claim situation. F or example, if an insured were aware that a coverage a pplication contained 
false financial data, this know ledge—which would ordinarily bar  coverage in a claim situation—will not 
be attributed to any other insureds who did not know that the f inancial statements were false. As a result, 
these so-called innocent insure ds will have coverage under the policy. However, if either the signer of the 
application or one of the three executive officers had knowledg e of the false data, their knowledge would 
be attributed to the innocent in sureds, and coverage would be b arred for the “innocen t insureds” as well. 
A limited severability provision is much less favorable for ins ureds, compared to a full severability 
provision. However, only a minority of insurers’ application fo rms contain limited severability 
provisions.  
management liability insurance —Insurance that covers exposures faced by directors, officers, 
managers, and business entities that arise from governance, fin ance, benefits, and management activities 
(also called “executive liability insurance”). This includes (1 ) directors and officers (D&O) liability 
insurance, (2) employment practices liability (EPL) insurance, (3) fiduciary liabili ty insurance, and (4) 
“special crime” insurance (coveri ng kidnap, ransom, and extorti on exposures). These coverages may be 
written as stand-alone insurance po licies or combined into a si ngle, “package” policy. Management 
liability “package” policies usua lly contain a set of common co nditions applying to a ll of the coverage 
lines purchased. In most cases, an insured must select a minimu m of two types of coverage to be eligible 
to purchase a management liabilit y “package” policy. This arran gement offers meaningful premium 
discounts because much of the sa me data is needed to underwrite  employment practices, D&O, fiduciary, 
and special crime coverages. M anagement liability “package” pol icies are usually available only to 
privately held firms, not-for-profit organizations, and small p ublicly traded companies (i.e., those with 
annual sales of under $25 million). L arge publicly traded firms  generally purchase stand-alone policies.  
Management Liability Insurance Specialist (MLIS®) —An insurance certification identifying an 
individual who has satisfactorily completed seven examinations covering various aspects of management 
liability exposures and insurance . The program emphasizes insur ance policies written to cover directors 
and officers (D&O), fiduciary, and employment practices liabili ty (EPL). In addition, there is 
considerable material addressing claims-made coverage triggers,  legal issues, underwriting methods, 
claims management, and loss control techniques. The program is administered by the International Risk 
Management Institute, Inc. (IRMI), of Dallas, Texas. 
most favorable venue wording —A provision found within some directors and officers (D&O), 
professional, and employment practices liability (EPL) policies  stating that, with respect to the 
insurability of punitive damages, the law of the jurisdiction m ost favorable to the insurability of punitive 
damages will apply, provided the jurisdiction meets one of the following criteria. It is the jurisdiction 
where (a) the punitive damages we re awarded, (b) the act giving  rise to the punitive damages award 
occurred, (c) the insured is inco rporated or maintains its prin cipal place of business, or (d) the insurer is 
incorporated or maintains its p rincipal place of business. When  this provision is included within a policy 
that affirmatively covers (or does not exclude) punitive damage s, it provides assurance that such damages 
will be covered by the insurer , despite the fact that covering punitive damages is contra ry to law in certain 
jurisdictions (e.g., California) . Most favored venue wording me rely modifies the existing level of 
coverage for punitive damages already provided by a policy. Suc h wording does not provide coverage if 
the policy otherwise excludes punitive damages. It is also impo rtant to recognize that the validity of this 
provision has not been tested in court. 
non-duty to defend —See Duty to defend. 
   
107 personal injury (PI) —Under general liability coverage , a category of insurable offe nses that produce 
harm other than bodily injury (BI). As covered by the commercia l general liability (CGL) policy, PI 
includes false arrest, detention, or imprisonment; malicious pr osecution; wrongful eviction; slander; libel; 
and invasion of privacy. Also addressed in the homeowners polic y. Under umbrella liability insurance, a 
broad category of insurable offenses that includes both BI and the offenses defined as “personal injury” in 
CGL policies. 
privately held corporation —A type of corporation whose shares are not for sale to the pub lic. Rather, 
the shares of privately held comp anies are usually owned by a s mall group of persons—often, although 
not always, family members and/or senior executives and manager s of the company. Unlike publicly held 
corporations, the shares of stock in privately held corporation s are not listed on the major stock 
exchanges.  
punitive damages —Damages in excess of those require d to compensate the plaintif f for the wrong done, 
which are imposed in order to p unish the defendant because of t he particularly wanton or willful nature of 
his or her wrongdoing. Also called “exemplary damages.” Althoug h the standard commercial general 
liability (CGL) policy and business auto policy (BAP) contain n o punitive damage exclusion, many 
umbrella and excess liability polic ies contain such an exclusio n. 
quota share excess directors a nd officers (D&O) programs —An approach involving the assumption of 
a given layer of excess coverage by more than one insurer. 
retention —(1) Assumption of risk of loss by means of noninsurance, self- insurance, or deductibles. 
Retention can be intentional or, when exposures are not identif ied, unintentional. (2) In reinsurance, the 
net amount of risk the ceding company keeps for its own account .  
retroactive date —A provision found in many (although not all) claims-made polic ies that eliminates 
coverage for claims produced by wrongful acts that took place p rior to a specified date, even if the claim 
is first made during the policy period. 
For example, a January 1, 2010 , retroactive date in a policy wr itten with a January 1 , 2010–2011, term, 
would bar coverage for claims resulting from wrongful acts that  took place prior to January 1, 2010, even 
if claims (resulting from such acts) are made against the insur ed during the January 1, 2010–2011, policy 
period. 
There are two purposes of retroactive dates: (1) to eliminate c overage for situations or incidents known to 
insureds that have the potential to give rise to claims in the future and (2) to preclude coverage for “stale” 
claims that arise from events far in the past, even if such eve nts are unknown to the insured. In the former 
case, the retroactive date preserves the principle of “fortuity ”—that is, the insurer should not be called 
upon to cover the so-called burning building. In the latter ins tance, the retroactive date makes policies 
more affordable by precluding co verage for events that, while i nsurable, are remote in time.  
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 —The Act and its accompanying ru les were enacted to protect inv estors 
in connection with the trading of  securities already issued and  outstanding. The most important 
components of the Act are Section 10(b) and Securities and Exch ange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5, 
which prohibits manipulative or deceptive acts in connection wi th the purchase or sale of a security. 
Corporate directors and officers are frequently the targets of lawsuits brought under these antifraud 
provisions. 
severability of interests clause —A policy provision clarifying that, except with respect to the  coverage 
limits, insurance applies to each insured as though a separate policy were issued to each. Thus, a policy 
containing such a clause will cove r a claim made by one insured  against another insured. 
   
108 severability provision in directo rs and officers (D&O) applicat ions—A provision in an application for 
D&O liability insurance stating that knowledge of material, fal se statements in the application that is 
possessed by one insured will not be imputed to other insured(s ). For example, if one insured was aware 
that a coverage application cont ained false financial data, thi s knowledge—which would ordinarily bar 
coverage—will not be attributed t o any other insureds who had n o knowledge that the financial 
statements were false. As a result, these so-called innocent in sureds will have covera ge under the policy. 
Most D&O insurers offer what is known as a “full severability p rovision” within their application forms, 
which is advantageous for insur eds. However, a significant mino rity of insurers use what is known as a 
limited severability provision, w hich is not nearly as favorabl e for policyholders.  
Side A coverage —The section of coverage under a directors and officers (D&O) l iability insurance 
policy affording “direct” coverage  of an organization’s directo rs and officers. This portion of the policy 
provides direct indemnification to the directors and officers f or acts for which the corporate organization 
is not legally required to indemnify the directors and officers . 
Side A-only coverage —A directors and officers (D&O) liability policy that provides only “direct” 
coverage of the directors and officers but does not cover the c orporation’s legal obligation to indemnify 
the directors and officers (known as Side B or corporate reimbu rsement coverage). Side A-only forms are 
written on either an excess or umbrella basis over a primary D& O policy. When written on an excess 
basis, they provide additional limits if a claim exhausts the c overage available under the primary form. 
When written on an umbrella basis, Side A-only policies afford broader coverage than the underlying, 
primary D&O policy, as well as additional limits. 
Side B coverage —Another term for what is known as the “Corporate Reimbursement  Coverage” section 
of a directors and officers (D&O) liability policy. 
Side C coverage —Another term for what is known as the “Entity Securities Cover age” section of a 
directors and officers (D&O) liability policy. 
subrogation : The assignment to an insurer by terms of the policy or by law , after payment of a loss, of 
the rights of the insured to recover the amount of the loss fro m one legally liable for it.  
subrogation provision —A provision in an insurance policy addressing whether the insu red has the right 
to waive its recovery rights against another party that may hav e been responsible for loss covered under 
the policy. In standard commerc ial policies, the subrogation pr ovision is called “Transfer of Rights of 
Recovery Against Others to Us.”  
underlying coverage —With respect to any given polic y of excess insurance, the cove rage in place on the 
same risk that will respond to l oss before the excess policy is  called on to pay any portion of the claim. 
wage and hours claim —An assertion by an employee-plaintiff that his or her employer  has failed to pay 
overtime wages owed to the employee. Within the past several ye ars, a number of high-profile, high-
dollar wage and hour claims have  been filed on a class action b asis, a fact that has vastly increased the 
dollar amount payable under such lawsuits. Given the magnitude of this exposure, most employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies specifically excl ude coverage for wage and hour claims. 
warranty —(1) A guarantee of the perform ance of a product. Product warra nties are included within the 
definition of the named insured’s product in general liability policies. (2) A statement of fact given to an 
insurer by the insured concerning the insured risk, which, if u ntrue, will void the policy.
