Introduction and Overview 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This WebCE course is designed to give a moderately experienced insurance person a detailed look at 
the key provisions contained within a corporate D&O liability insurance policy and how they function 
within various claims scenarios. The course begi ns by describing the policy’s three key insuring 
agreements and then examines the covered pe rsons, covered organiza tions, and covered acts 
provisions.  Next, it analyzes two of the policy’s most important defined terms: “covered damages” 
and “covered losses.” It continues with an analysis of the extent to which the policies cover employment practices liability exposures and describ es the policy’s defense coverage provisions and 
defense procedures. The manner in which a D& O policy’s limits, retentions, and coinsurance 
provisions apply is considered next, followed by a look at the policy’s most important conditions. The 
course reviews the exclusions section of the policy and the claims-made coverage trigger provisions. The final chapters analyze excess D&O liability policies and provide an overview of the specialized 
policy forms written to cover pr ivately-held companies.  
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Identify and distinguish between a corporat e D&O liability policy’s three major insuring 
agreements.  
2. Explain how the covered persons, covered organizations, and covered acts provisions 
coordinate within these three insuring agreements.  
3. Interpret the “covered damages” and “covered lo sses” definitions and describe how they first 
define, and then limit the scope of coverage the policy provides. 
4. State the extent to which D&O policies provide employment practices liability coverage and explain how endorsements to the forms can furt her expand upon the extent of such coverage. 
5. Explain the scope of defense coverage provide d by the D&O policies, distinguish between 
duty to defend and non-duty to defend po licies, and describe how these two provisions 
function in a claim situation. 
6. Analyze the manner in which a D&O policy’s lim its, retentions, and coinsurance provisions 
coordinate with the policy’s three key insuring agreements. 
7. Describe the critical policy conditions found within D&O forms, including: severability, 
cancellation, subrogation, other insurance, arbitration, presumptive indemnification 
provisions, and priority of payments provisions . Distinguish between “limited” and “full” 
severability provisions. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
2 8. List and discuss the major exclusions found within D&O policies, distinguishing between the 
different versions of the same exclusion, and explaining the rationale for each of these 
exclusions. 
9. Give details concerning the operation of a clai ms-made coverage trigge r. Understand how the 
terms claims first made, post-po licy reporting window, retroac tive date, discovery provision, 
extended reporting and runoff provisions relate to su ch triggers and apply in claim situations.   
10. Analyze the way in which excess D&O liability policies are stru ctured to interact with 
primary D&O coverage and explain how the ma jor policy provisions function in a claim 
situation.  
11. Identify the unique exposures of privately held organizations a nd describe the how the 
coverage features within the policies differ fro m those contained in the forms designed to 
cover corporate/for-profit firms. 
 
 
 
    
 
     
 
    
3 Chapter 2 
The D&O Policy: Insuring Agreements 
This chapter analyzes the three distinct insuring agreements found within corporate D&O policy 
forms. The first—known as “Side A” coverage, also termed “directors and officers liability 
insurance”—provides liability coverage  for individual directors and officers of the parent corporation. 
The second insuring agreement—known as “Side B” cove rage, also termed “corporate reimbursement 
insurance”—reimburses the corporation for payments it is legally obligated (or permitted) to make in indemnifying its directors and officers for liability claims made against them. The third—known as “Side C” coverage, also termed “entity coverage” —c overs the corporation for claims made against it 
relating to the corporation’s securities (i.e., shares of publicly-traded stock) . The coverage provided 
by D&O policy forms is illustrated in Exhibit 2.1.

Combined single limit for all three coverages. 
Directors and Officers Liability Coverage (“Side A”) 
The first insuring agreement of a D&O policy covers what is known as the “direct” or “non-
indemnifiable” liability of an organization’s director s and officers. If such persons are found liable to 
third parties—and the corporation is not legally liabl e and\or is financially unable to indemnify the 
directors and officers—this portion of the policy pr omises to indemnify them for claim payments and 
defense costs they incur as a result of such liability.  
Side A coverage applies in three situations: (1) when  the parent organization is not legally required to 
indemnify directors and officers for a specific clai m, (2) when the defendant directors and officers 
must pay a settlement or judgment in a shareholder derivative lawsuit (derivative claims are actions 
brought on behalf of a corporation against its own directors and officers, as opposed to claims brought 
on behalf of an individual), or (3) when the corpor ation lacks the financial capacity to indemnify the Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
4 directors and officers, which usually occurs when it is  insolvent. In each of these situations, Side A of 
the policy provides indemnification of the corpora tion’s directors and officers on a “direct” basis. 
Side A-Only D&O Policies 
Recognizing the importance of these exposures, beginn ing in the early part of the 2000s insurers 
began to offer what are known as “Side A-only” polic ies. Such policies are written in conjunction 
with “primary” D&O policies (which contain both Side A and Side B covera ge and usually Side C 
coverage), provide coverage on an excess basis (e xcess of the corporation’s primary D&O policy), 
and usually (but not always) cove r only independent/outside directors (i.e., directors who are not 
employees of the company).  
The intent of Side A-only policies is twofold. 
• To provide excess limits in the event the lim its under the primary form are exhausted by 
claim payments and defense costs.  
• To “drop down” over primary forms, in the ev ent that an exclusion or other coverage 
restriction under the primary form applies,  that would otherwise defeat coverage.  
Corporate Entity Is Not an Insured under Side-A Policies 
Another key point to recognize is that the parent  organization is not an insured under Side A-only 
policies. Rather, the forms only provide coverage fo r the directors and officers—not for the corporate 
organization’s obligation to indemnify such pers ons. In effect, Side A policies operate like D&O 
umbrella policies but only as respects the coverage provided by Side A of the primary D&O policy.  
Exhibit 2.2 provides a description of the advantages provided by Side A-only coverage forms. 
 
Exhibit 2.2 
Advantages Of Side A-Only Coverage Forms 
Coverage Assured in Bankruptcy Situations  
One of the most important advantages of a Side A-only policy is that under a standard D&O form, 
there is sometimes uncertainty as to whether directors and officers have access to the proceeds 
of such policies in the event a company declares bankruptcy. More specifically, there have been 
a number of conflicting court decisions on this iss ue. Some decisions indicate that the proceeds 
of a D&O policy belong to the directors and offi cers. Conversely, other decisions have held that 
such proceeds are the property of the bankruptcy trustee (because it “stands in the shoes” of the 
corporate entity), a holding that usually precludes reimbursement of insured directors and 
officers. However, since the corporate organization is not an insured under Side A-only forms, 
coverage for the directors is not in doubt, even when a company is insolvent and a bankruptcy trustee seeks access to policy proceeds.  
 
 
 
   Chapter 2—The D&O Policy: Insuring Agreements

 Exhibit 2.2 (cont.) 
Advantages Of Side A-Only Coverage Forms  
Inapplicability of Severable Warranties  
Another obstacle to a director’s obtaining acce ss to D&O policy proceeds is the application of 
nonseverable warranties. This refers to a situation in which coverage for a director is barred because 
of fraud or concealment by a corporation’s CEO or CF O in providing information within the application 
for coverage. For example, assume a CEO knows of a situation that is likely to produce a claim. The 
CEO intentionally conceals such circumstances in the application for D&O coverage. Coverage for 
the claim will be barred as to all directors and o fficers under the policy. This is because such 
warranties are nonseverable, meaning that ev en directors who had no knowledge of these 
circumstances will be bound by the CEO’s fraudulent  statements in the application. However, under 
Side A-only policy forms, this otherwise nonseverabl e warranty, which ordina rily defeats coverage for 
nonculpable directors and officers, does not apply, so  that coverage would be available under such 
circumstances. 
Exclusions for Financial Restatements  
Yet another coverage gap is created by exclusions for coverage of claims produced by financial 
restatements. (A financial restatement occurs when a publicly traded corporation must make a 
material revision to one of its recently-released ea rnings statements, almost always in a manner 
indicating that profits were lower or losses were  larger than originally reported.) Again, such 
exclusions do not appear in Side A-only policy forms. Therefore, despite the presence of such an 
exclusion in a primary D&O form, coverage would n onetheless apply to directors insured by a Side A-
only policy, because most types of Side A-only forms would “drop down” over the coverage gap 
caused by the financial restatement exclusion in the primary policy.  
Nonrescindable Policy  
Side A-only forms cannot be rescinded based on fraud committed by any insureds under the policy. 
In contrast, under traditional ABC D&O policies, an insurer can rescind an insurance policy when it 
finds that the insured has misr epresented a material fact when applying for coverage, such as 
providing a fraudulent financial statement with its application. (The rescission of a policy means that 
the policy never went into effect. Under such circumstances, an insurer must return the entire 
premium to the insured.)   
Although coverage under a Side A policy would be denied as to an insured(s) who intentionally 
provided false information on an application, su ch coverage would still apply to other, nonculpable 
insureds under the policy, which is not always the case under traditional ABC policy forms. 
Additional Policy Limits Available for Mega-Claim Situations  
Since D&O policies are written with a combined single limit for all three insuring agreements (see 
Exhibit 2.1), when the corporate entity is named in mega-securities litigation (e.g., $100+ million), 
policy limits are usually depleted by the claim applic able to Coverage C (entity securities coverage), 
leaving little or no monies available for claims t hat also name directors and officers. However, the 
presence of a Side A-only policy, which contains a “dedicated” limit for directors and officers—and is 
not accessible by the corporate entity—solves this problem.  
The Two Types of Side A-Only Coverage 
There are two types of Side A-only policies: (1) those written on a pure excess basis and (2) those 
providing “true” umbrella covera ge (also called difference in conditions (DIC) coverage).  
• Pure Excess Side A-Only Policies —Such forms afford coverage on the same basis as the 
primary D&O policy. That is, coverage is subj ect to the same terms and conditions of the 
underlying policy(ies). The only additional cove rage that “pure excess Side A-only” forms 
provide is limits excess of primary coverage.  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
6 • Umbrella (DIC) Side A-Only Policies —“Umbrella (DIC) Side A-only” policies provide 
“true” umbrella coverage over a primary D&O po licy and are therefore subject to their own 
terms and conditions. Accordingly, they will “d rop down” over the Side A coverage provided 
within the primary D&O policy, in situations where the primary policy contains an exclusion 
or other provision that precludes coverage. 
Variations within Si de A-Only Coverage 
There are two key variations of Si de A-only coverage. First, some co rporations purchase an “all Side 
A” program and, second, a number of corporations purchase a Side A policy applying only to their 
independent/outside (i.e., nonemployee) directors. 
• “All Side A” Program —A minority of corporations choose to purchase only Side A 
coverage, leaving their Side B (corporate re imbursement) and Side C (entity securities) 
exposures self-insured. The rationale behind this approach is that, first, such companies 
foresee a low probability of (1) claims against their directors and officers and (2) securities 
claims against the corporate entity. In additi on, even in the event of a claim, these 
organizations feel their balance sheets are str ong enough to withstand whatever defense costs 
and claim payments may be required to respond to  such claims. Accordingly, they believe the 
only type of coverage that is really necessary is Side A, because it applies in situations where 
the directors and officers cannot legally be indemnified by the corporation or when the 
corporation cannot indemnify the directors due to its insolvency .   
• Coverage for Outside/Independent Directors Only (“IDL” Coverage) —A second 
variation of Side A-only policies are those covering only outside/ independent directors while 
not covering “inside” directors (i.e., directors who are also employees of the company). An 
argument can be made, and a number of actual cl aim situations have proven, that outside 
directors, given their lack of day-to-day contact with and control over the inner workings of 
the corporate organization, require a greater level of protection compared to “inside” directors 
and officers. Accordingly, so-called IDL (independent directors liability) policies fill this need. Such forms also serve as a recruitment tool for independent directors who want to serve on a corporate board but seek additiona l protection of their personal assets.  
The need for IDL coverage was illu strated when a number of outside/independent directors at Enron 
and WorldCom were forced to contribute pers onal funds to securities liability settlements with 
shareholders, because coverage limits of the Enron’ s corporate policies had been exhausted by claims 
against the company’s inside directors. If IDL polici es had been in effect, such coverage would have 
provided additional limits that could have covere d the settlements and prevented the independent 
directors from having to resolve claims using their personal funds. 
A Word about Side-A Only Coverage Limits 
Despite the value of such policies, a number of e xperts recommend that companies exercise a certain 
amount of caution when purchasing Side A coverage limits, especially for outside directors. Specifically, it has been suggested  that a company purchase a maximum of 10 percent of its “regular” 
D&O policy limit for Side A-Only coverage for its independent/outside directors and no more than an 
additional 10 percent of its “regular” D&O policy limit for its inside directors and officers.  
 
 Chapter 2—The D&O Policy: Insuring Agreements 
 
7 
 Using this formula, if a company had a “regular,” “ABC” D&O limit of $25 million, it should buy: 
• $2.5 million in coverage under a Side A-only policy for the company’s outside/independent 
directors, and 
• $2.5 million in coverage under a Side A-only polic y covering the company’s inside directors.  
Thus, in this example, the company would have a $25 million “ABC” D&O policy and two $2.5 
million Side A-only policies; one covering the compan y’s outside directors and the other covering the 
company’s inside directors.  
The 10 percent figure is recommended for outside di rectors because their exposure is usually small 
(even in the most egregious cases of corporate wrongdoing, like Enron and Worldcom), compared to 
inside directors. Accordingly, the 10 percent figur e is still generally sufficient to guarantee that the 
outside directors will have enough “dedicated” prot ection in the event that  (a) the limits of the 
corporate policy are exhausted and (b) a bankruptcy court rules that the corporate policy proceeds are the property of the bankruptcy trustee, rather than those of the individual directors and officers. Similarly, the 10 percent figure is appropriate for the inside directors because although their exposure is greater than that of outside directors, there are normally only half as many inside directors as outside directors. Thus, if both outside and inside di rectors have an equal limit of coverage (as in the 
example above), on the typical board, the inside di rectors will actually have twice as much coverage 
on a per director  basis. For example, in the case of a board with 12 members, 8 of whom are outside 
directors and 4 of whom are inside directors,  if  each group had an equal limit of coverage, the inside 
directors would actually have twice as mu ch coverage on a per person basis.  
Corporate Reimbursement Coverage (“Side B”)  
The second insuring agreement in a D&O policy is called “Side B” or corporate reimbursement coverage. This part of the polic y covers the parent company’s obligation to indemnify the insured 
directors or officers for claim payments and defen se costs associated with wrongful acts the directors 
or officers committed while serving the organizati on. The following documents typically require 
corporations to indemnify their directors and officers for wrongful acts. 
• The organization’s charter or bylaws  
• Individual agreements with a director or officer as a condition of employment  
• State indemnification statutes  
• Common law requirements in the state of incorporation  
The Corporation is Required To Indemnify Retention Amounts 
In situations where corporations are required to indemnify directors and officers against claims from 
wrongful acts, such requirements also usually include the requirement to reimburse any retention amounts that may not apply to the limits of liab ility under a D&O policy. For instance, if a D&O 
claim requires a director to expend $5 million in settlement and defense costs, the organization is 
required to reimburse the full $5 million, even if a $1 million policy retention applies to the corporate indemnification portion of the policy. This is important because with the exception of a situation involving corporate insolvency, practically all D&O claims (against the directors and officers) are 
paid under the corporate reimbursement (“Side B”  coverage) provision of the policy, rather than 
under Side A (directors and officers coverage). Thus, in the event of a claim, the corporation must Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
8 ultimately absorb the (normally substantial) cost of the retention stated in the D&O policy—not the 
individual directors and officers. 
Complementary Nature of the Two Insuring Agreements 
The two insuring agreements, A and B, of a D&O policy are complementary. That is, if a director or 
officer incurs liability of a type for which the company is required to indemnify that director or 
officer, the D&O insurer will make the required indemnification on behalf of the company under Side B of the policy. On the other hand, when the co mpany provides no indemnification, the D&O policy 
will afford direct coverage for the directo r(s) or officer(s) under Side A of the policy. 
One confusing factor relating to indemnification is  that state law defines the types of liabilities for 
which a company may or may not indemnify its directors and officers. However, if the amounts a 
director or officer is required to pay (because of a particular wrongful act) are not indemnifiable by 
the company under the applicable state law, cove rage may still exist under the D&O policy’s other 
insuring agreement—the one providing direct  coverage for the directors and officers themselves (i.e., 
Side A coverage). 
Entity Securities Coverage (“Side C”)  
One of the common misconceptions about director s and officers liability insurance is that it 
automatically covers the parent organization if  the company is sued directly. However, unless 
endorsed accordingly (by means of having purchased  “Side C” Coverage), corporate D&O forms 
only cover the parent organization’s loss when indemnifying a director or officer for a wrongful act. In effect, coverage under Sides A and B of a D&O policy is limited to situations when a lawsuit specifically names the organization’s directors and officers (either individually or collectively). On the other hand, coverage under Sides A and B will be denied if the lawsuit names only the parent 
organization.  
Side C Coverage Is Only for Securities-Related Claims 
To address this “gap” in coverage when the corporat e organization is named in a lawsuit (either alone, 
or in conjunction with directors and officers), in the mid-1990s insurers introduced what is known as “entity coverage.” Given the fact that a publicly  traded corporate organization’s single largest 
exposure relates to its potential liability as an issuer of securities, the corporate D&O policies that provide entity coverage do so only as respects securities claims . Such coverage is afforded under a 
separate section of a D&O policy, also known as “Side C” coverage. More specifically, this section of the policy covers the corporate entity in situations where a claimant names the corporate entity alone or names both the entity and individual directors and officers in a claim associated with securities. 
An Example: A Covered versus a Non-Covered Claim under Side C 
Assume that a claimant sues an insured corpora tion, alleging that the corporation had breached a 
contract to deliver $2 million of its product. The claimant’s lawsuit cites damages incurred resulting 
from the company’s failure to deliver their produc t. There would be no coverage under Side C (or 
under any other portion of a corporate D&O policy form) for this type of claim. This is because Side 
C applies only to claims involving the securities (i.e., shares of stock) issued by the insured 
corporation. On the other hand, a claimant brings a lawsuit alleging that poor management decisions 
caused the corporation to suffer a quarterly loss. Within 2 days of the announcement of this loss, 
publicly traded shares of the company have dropped in value by 50 percent. Side C of the policy 
would cover such a claim since it involves secu rities issued by the insured company.  Chapter 2—The D&O Policy: Insuring Agreements 
 
9 
 Purchase Is Always Optional 
It should be noted that most D&O insurers allo w insureds the option to either purchase or not 
purchase entity coverage for securities claims (while  still buying “traditional” Side A and Side B 
D&O coverages). The insured’s choice  is reflected on the declarations page of the policy, although 
the vast majority (i.e., around 95 percent) of all publicly traded firms purchase entity securities 
coverage. (As will be explained in Chapter 12 of this course, privately held companies do not need to 
purchase entity securities coverage separately, because such coverage is automatically built into D&O 
policy forms designed to cover privately held companies.) 
Limits for Entity Coverage of Securities Claims 
As is the case with Coverage A (directors a nd officers liability) and Coverage B (corporate 
reimbursement), Entity Securities coverage is also subject to the policy’s aggregate limit. Again, it 
should be emphasized that claims in any combination  under any of these three coverages (A, B, C) 
can exhaust the policy’s aggregate limit. 
Retentions for Entity Coverage 
Typically, however, coverage for securities claims is generally subject to a separate, and at times 
larger, retention than that applicable to Cove rage B (corporate reimbursement) and Coverage A 
(direct coverage for directors and officers, which is  not subject to a retention). Coverage under Side C 
of a D&O policy is subject to a higher retention because securities claims against corporate entities 
are usually much larger than other typ es of claims made under Coverage B.  
Allocation Issues under Entity Securities (“Side C”) Coverage 
One unique aspect of entity securities liability coverage  is that in a number of instances, claims will 
be made against the entity that: 
• Are also made against other parties not covered by the policy (i.e., nondirectors and 
nonofficers), known as “covered versus unc overed party” allocation, and  
• Sometimes involve individual allegations  that are not covered by the policy (i.e., claims not 
involving securities) along with those that do involve securities, which is known as “covered 
versus uncovered claim” allocation.  
In each of these two instances, an “allocation” or ap portionment must be made in which the insured 
and the insurer determine the extent to which each of the parties  named in a lawsuit is entitled to 
indemnification from the D&O policy, and the extent to which each specific type of allegation 
comprising the claim is or is not covered by the D&O policy. 
Covered versus Uncovered Party Allocation 
Typically, a lawsuit names both individual directors and officers and the corporate entity. In cases 
where entity coverage is not purchased, the insurer must “allocate” or apportion coverage between the 
corporate entity on one hand and the directors and offi cers on the other. It must, according to the facts 
surrounding the claim, determine which specific allegations pertain to individual directors and officers and which result from the acts of pers ons who are not insured by the policy (i.e., 
nondirectors/nonofficers).  
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
10 It should be recognized that in recent years, especia lly with the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 
2002 (SOx), insurers have added nondirectors/nonofficers as insureds  with high level responsibilities 
(e.g., corporate comptrollers, senior staff attorneys)  under Coverage C. This is because SOx expanded 
the personal liability of such individuals and for whic h coverage is now typically required in a large, 
publicly traded corporation. Such a coverage extension has significantly reduced the number of 
covered versus uncovered pa rty allocation disputes.  
Covered versus Uncovered Claim Allocation 
Another type of allocation issue arises when some, but not all, of the allegations comprising a D&O 
claim are covered under a given policy form. For example, a single lawsuit might involve allegations 
of both wrongful financial reporting that caused the share price of an insured’s stock to nosedive, 
combined with allegations of damages caused by pollu tion. In this situation, an allocation would have 
to be made between the damages resulting from the former claim, wh ich would be covered under Side 
C, and the latter claim, for which virt ually all D&O forms exclude coverage. 
Allocation Provisions in D&O Policies 
Apportionment of an insurer’s payment is extremely complex in both covered person/uncovered person and covered claim/uncovered claim situations. Usually, the extent (i.e., the percentage) to 
which a claim is covered, becomes a matter of  contentious negotiation between the parent 
organization and the insurer, rather than a function of straightforward application of policy terms.  
Nevertheless, since disputes frequently result from the allocation process, D&O forms contain 
allocation provisions that are aimed at providing  guidance as to how the allocation process will be 
conducted, in an effort to reduce, if not avert, such controversies.  
Best Efforts Allocation Provisions 
By far, the most common type of allocation provi sion in D&O policies is known as the “best efforts” 
provision, whereby both insurer and insured promise to use their “best efforts” in apportioning 
covered claim amounts, based on the relative legal exposures of the parties and based on the type(s) of claims made. In the event they are unable to do so, the insurer promises to advance what it 
considers to be “fair and proper” amounts, on the insu red’s behalf, prior to resolving the dispute. In 
some instances, an arbitrator is hired to make an  allocation determination, although in most cases, the 
insured and insurer are able to negotiate allocati ons between themselves. (Judges, on the other hand, 
do not participate in allocation proceedings.)

Answers to Chapter 2 Review Questions 
1. b. Side B provides corporate reimbursement coverage. 
2. a. The situation which is covered is when director s and officers are found liable to third parties and 
Tau is financially unable to indemnify them. These circumstances are covered under Side A. 
3. c. There is sometimes uncertainty as to whether di rectors and officers have access to policy proceeds in 
the event a company d eclares bankruptcy. 
4. b. If the amounts a director or officer is required to  pay (because of a particular wrongful act) are not 
indemnifiable by the company under the applicable state law, coverage may still exist under the D&O 
policy's Side A coverage.  
5. d. Coverage will be available for the individual board members because Sides A&B, which have been 
purchased, will cover the individual board memb ers. However, Side C which would cover the 
corporation, has not been purchased.  
13 Chapter 3 
Covered Persons, Organizations, and Acts under D&O Policies 
This chapter examines the covered persons, covere d organizations, and cove red acts provisions found 
within corporate D&O policy forms.  
Covered Persons under D&O Policies 
D&O policies are designed to automatically cover an y person occupying the position of director or 
officer, without requiring that such individuals be  specifically named in the policy declarations.  
(Note: the corporate charter is usually the s ource that determines which specific positions are 
designated as “officers” within a corporation. A person ’s official title can actually be misleading as to 
whether or not they are an officer of a corporatio n. For example, the “Chief Administrator” of a 
hospital is virtually always an officer—despite not  having the title of “Vice President” or “Chief 
Executive Officer.” On the other hand, the literally hundreds of Assistant Vice Presidents at large, 
national banks are generally not officers of the corporation, despite having the title of “Vice 
President.”) 
Coverage Only for Acts as a Director/Officer  
It should be recognized, however, that directors a nd officers are covered only for claims that allege 
wrongdoing while acting in the capacity of a director  or officer. Where such acts of misconduct were 
not performed in such a capacity, claims under a D& O policy are not covered. For instance, often the 
chief counsel or senior legal person in an organization is also a corporate officer and, in some 
instances, this individual sits on the corporation's board of directors. In these situations, D&O policies 
do not cover such persons for their acts as attorneys (e.g., for liability incurred when drafting a 
contract or when making a court appearance on the or ganization's behalf). Rather, such exposures are 
addressed by specialized policies designed to cove r their liabilities incurred as employed lawyers, 
known as “Employed Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance.” In effect, a D&O policy would only 
cover the organization's chief counsel for acts that would subject nonattorneys to liability (e.g., voting 
to approve a merger or acquisition at a board meeting).  
“Automatic” Coverage for Newl y-Created Directors/Officers 
Few insurers mandate that the parent report newl y-created director or officer positions. This is 
because D&O premiums are not based upon the numbe r of covered individuals. (D&O premiums are 
more closely correlated with an organization's to tal assets.) Where reporting requirements do exist, 
they can usually be deleted upon request. In fact, mo st underwriters prefer not to deal with numerous Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
14 name and position changes that may take place duri ng the policy term. Accordingly, coverage under 
D&O forms is said to be “automatic.” 
Coverage for Nondirectors/Nonofficers 
When requested, underwriters will normally agree to broaden the policy to cover corporate managers 
with high-level responsibilities despite the fact that they are not technically officers (e.g., the 
corporate assistant treasurer or human resources mana ger). Addition of such persons as insureds can 
usually be accomplished for a nominal additional premiu m, if any. Such coverage extensions require 
that these nonofficers be reported to the underwriter. In some organizations, such as hospitals, officer positions are not always denoted by the term “vice president.” Thus, a person who is, in effect, the 
chief executive officer of a hospital may ha ve the title “chief administrator.” Under these 
circumstances, it may be worthwhile to specifically list, in the policy declarations, the person or persons for whom coverage  is intended to apply. 
Removal of Officers for Premium Credits 
Although some underwriters  will grant premium reductions in return for removing coverage of 
individuals who are technically officers but who do not have true manage ment responsibilities (such 
as the many assistant vice presidents in banks), su ch reductions may be negligible unless numerous 
individuals are involved (e.g., more than 100). 
Coverage of Nondirectors/Nonoffi cers for Securities Claims 
In recent years, and as noted earlier, a number of insurers have added nondirectors/nonofficers as insureds, although only for securities claims. The need  to add such persons as insureds stems from the 
fact that under SOx,  in addition to directors and officers, in-house accounting and legal personnel 
(e.g., auditors, staff attorneys) also can be held liable for a number of wrongful acts, the nature of 
which are sometimes asserted in lawsuits, most ofte n in those involving securities. For this reason, an 
increasing number of insurers are a dding this covera ge extension. 
Coverage of Past, Present, and Future Directors and Officers 
The policies intend to cover persons who: 
• served as directors and officers in the past,  
• currently serve, or  
• those who will serve in the future.  
Coverage of Past/Retired Directors 
Coverage of past personnel is important because clai ms are routinely made against individuals after 
they have left the company but were directors a nd officers at the time of an alleged wrongful act. 
Such coverage also ensures the full cooperation of  these individuals in defending a claim, which 
might not be the case if they were not insureds under the policy. 
Coverage of Future Directors 
By covering future directors and officers, it is made  clear that the insurance is not limited only to 
those holding director and officer positions at the inception of the policy period. This is significant because a claim may be made against an individual di rector or officer after he or she assumes such a 
position but before the parent organization has had an opportunity to notify the underwriter to this Chapter 3—Covered Persons, Organizat ions, and Acts under D&O Policies 
 
15 
 effect. One final important point: coverage of ne w directors requires no notification to the insurer 
within any specific time frame during the policy (oth er than notification by means of their inclusion 
within a renewal application).  
Specialized Policies for Past/Retired Directors 
Directors of public companies are exposed to claims  long after their tenure on a board has ended. (In 
fact, the statute of limitations under SOx is 5 years.) As already noted, directors who sat on the boards 
at Enron and WorldCom were required to use their personal assets to settle lawsuits filed against them 
because the corporations they served were financ ially unable to provide indemnification due to 
insolvency. More recently, in 2007, five former dir ectors of Just for Feet paid a total of $41.5 million 
in conjunction with their service at the company,  an amount that exceeded the combined Enron and 
WorldCom director-funded settlements.    
The Liability Exposure of Retired Directors: An Example 
Persons who serve on a board of directors are expos ed to liability claims long after their tenure has 
concluded. Consider a director who sat on a board for 10 years, from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 2005. On January 1, 2006, 1 year after retiring, th e director is sued for alleged wrongful acts he 
committed during this 10-year period. The fact that the director is no longer a board member at the 
time the claim is made does not absolve him from liability. Now, in response to the claim, the retired 
director must provide a defense to these allegati ons and perhaps pay a settlement or judgment in 
conjunction with the lawsuit. 
Gaps in Coverage for Retired Dir ectors in Standard D&O Programs 
As already noted, coverage under a corporation’s D&O program would normally be available to defend and indemnify the retired director in the above example. This is b ecause the “insured persons” 
definitions under virtually all standard D&O policy forms state that “... coverage applies to past, present, and future directors, for claims made agai nst them during the term of the policy.” Coverage 
applies to retired directors with no time limit, although functionally, such coverage does not extend much beyond the policy term, given the claims-m ade basis upon which D&O policies are written. 
(Claims-made coverage triggers are discussed at length in Chapter 10.)   
Given the claims-made nature of D&O forms, covera ge is triggered by the making of a claim against 
an insured. As long as a D&O policy is in force on the date the claim is made (January 1, 2006, in the 
above example), coverage should, in theory, be  available to the retired director under the 
corporation's current D&O policy. There are, howev er, a number of reasons why this may not be the 
case. 
• A policy is no longer in force.  The company may not have a policy in place on January 1, 
2006. If the organization is in poor financial c ondition, it may not have had the funds to buy 
coverage or it may have been forced to redu ce limits. Or, even if the firm attempted to 
purchase a policy, the premium, given the organization’s difficulties, might have been 
unaffordable. Since, as already noted, coverage under a claims-made policy is triggered by the date on which claim is made—rather th an the date on which the wrongful act was 
committed—the fact that coverage was in place during the time the alleged wrongful acts 
took place (i.e., from January 1, 1995 through Janua ry 1, 2005), does not trigger coverage for 
a claim made on January 1, 2006.  
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
16 • No limits remain.  But even if a policy was in place at the time a claim is made against the 
retired director, other directors and officers, as well as the organization, are also likely to 
have been named in the lawsuit (or in other lawsuits). Consequently, the policy's limits may 
already have been exhausted by indemnity payments and/or defense costs in conjunction with 
such claims.  
• Various restrictions preclude coverage. A number of restrictions within the policy, most 
likely exclusions, may allow the insurer to de ny coverage for a claim against the retired 
director. The fact that these restrictions or exclusions were not contained within the policy that covered the retired director at the time he /she left the organization is of no consequence 
in determining whether coverage is currently ava ilable. Rather, the policy in effect at the time 
a claim is made is what controls the trigger of coverage. The key point to recognize is that policies renewed subsequent to a director’s retirement may contain much more restrictive 
terms and conditions compared to the coverage that was in place during the director's tenure 
with the company.  
• A bankruptcy trustee claims ownership of policy proceeds.  In recent years, bankruptcy 
trustees have frequently claimed primary owne rship of D&O policy proceeds, asserting that 
their interests supersede those of the insu red directors, officers, and the corporate 
organization. In some instances cour ts have upheld th is contention. 
• The policy has been rescinded.  The policy may have been rescinded by the insurer, most 
often, based upon a material representation cont ained within the application for coverage.  
The Need for Separate, Retired Directors Coverage 
Many of the coverage gaps noted above stem from th ree major sources: lack of control over the D&O 
program, conflicting legal interests, and sharing of  limits with incumbent directors. These sources 
provide the rationale as to why directors require separ ate coverage after they leave a corporate board.   
• No Control over D&O Program. After a director has retired from a board, he or she has no control over the nature of the D&O coverage the organization buys. This is especially true if a 
company is taken over by a leveraged buy-out fi rm or even if one company is purchased by 
another. In these situations, the new organiza tion's management has no loyalty to retired 
directors.  
• Conflicting Legal Interests.  When a director retires from a board, he or she may have 
different, if not conflicting, legal interests, compared to current directors or to the 
organization’s operating executives. The Enron case provides a good example of this concept. 
Here, the outside directors were merely neg ligent in fulfilling their duties. Conversely, a 
number of the company’s operating officers were either convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, 
criminal wrongdoing.  
• Shared Policy Limits. Even when legal interests of the various insureds under a D&O policy 
are not in conflict, there remains the problem  of shared policy limits, whereby multiple 
individual insureds, including th e corporation itself (for securities claims), must “compete” 
for coverage limits under a D&O policy. Adding to  this problem is the fact that in recent 
years, as discussed above, the trend is toward  expanding the number of insured persons 
within D&O coverage forms. Since SOx impo sed substantial legal liabilities on corporate 
auditors and in-house legal staff, as already mentioned, underwriters  responded by adding Chapter 3—Covered Persons, Organizat ions, and Acts under D&O Policies 
 
17 
 these and other non-directors/non-officers as insureds under D&O policies; the effect of 
which is to heighten the competition for policy limits. 
Coverage Aspects of Retired Directors Policies 
Following are the key features of policies written to cover retired directors. 
• Coverage applies for a 6-year term, following retirement.  
• Premium is a flat, prepaid amount affording coverage for 6 years.  
• The retired director is the only insured.  
• The insured director—not the insurer—selects defense counsel.  
• There is no requirement to maintain underlying insurance.  
• The policy is written without a deductible/self-insured retention.  
• The policy is noncancelable and nonrescindable  
Coverage of Subsidiary Directors and Officers  
Directors and officers liability policies cover individual directors and officers at a number of corporate levels. Accordingly, coverage automa tically applies to directors and officers of: 
• the parent company,  
• existing, majority-owned subsidiaries of the parent company, and  
• newly-created/acquired subsidiaries of the parent.  
Directors and officers of the parent company and existing subsidiaries are automatically covered at the inception of the policy. This is because the application normally includes underwriting data 
pertinent to these individuals, and the premium quoted reflects the exposure they generate. 
Typically, policies define the term “subsidiary” as an entity in which the parent company owns more 
than 50 percent of the voting stock. However, a few policies contain somewhat more liberal 
definitions of “subsidiary” and broa den the term to include corporati ons in which a subsidiary or any 
entity of the parent company owns 100 percent of the voting stock (even if the parent corporation 
does not hold a majority interest in the subsidiary). 
Coverage of Directors and Office rs of Foreign Subsidiaries 
The directors and officers of a corporation’s fore ign subsidiaries do not always have the title of 
“director” or “officer,” despite the fact that thei r duties, responsibilities, and legal liability exposures 
are similar, if not identical, to their United States counterparts. Accordingly, D&O policy “insured persons” definitions sometimes provide coverage of such individua ls who function as directors and 
officers but whose official titles may not be “dir ector” or “officer.” Organizations with foreign 
personnel who fall within this category should have  their D&O policies endorsed accordingly, if the 
policy's definition of “insured persons” does not afford such coverage, under what is known as a 
“foreign functional equivalents” provision.  
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
18 Coverage of Estates, Heirs, and Legal Representatives 
Most of the policies also cover the estates, heirs, and legal representatives of insureds. A D&O claim 
is a claim against the personal assets of the individual directors and officers; therefore, such protection will be transferred to the insured’s heirs, estates, or trustees if he or she dies, is declared 
incompetent, or files for bankruptcy. 
Spousal Coverage 
Insured directors and officers sometimes atte mpt to shield assets from potential D&O claim 
judgments by transferring those assets to their spouses.  To counter this tactic, plaintiffs’ attorneys 
name spouses in suit papers. Therefore, spouses also require protection under the D&O form, and insurers have responded to this need by extending insured status to the spouses of insured directors 
and officers. 
Coverage Applies to Spousal St atus, Not to Spousal Acts 
It is important to note, however, that spousal c overage does not extend protection for the wrongful act 
of a spouse of an insured director/officer; rather, such provisions only cover that spouse’s liability as 
a spouse of an insured or because the spouse shares interest in property of an insured director/officer. Thus, there would be no coverage of a spouse who is not a director or officer if he/she were accused 
of fraud. Coverage would only apply to the nondirect or/nonofficer spouse if such an allegation were 
also made against the spouse (for his or her corporate wrongdoing) who is a director or officer.  
Spousal Coverage Definition That  Includes “Domestic Partners” 
An increasing percentage of insurers’ forms contai n a spousal coverage definition that covers “... 
spouses, including ‘domestic partners.’”  (A domestic  partnership is a legal or personal relationship 
between two individuals who live together and sh are a common domestic life but are neither joined 
by a traditional marriage nor a civil union.) Given the increasing incidence of such living 
arrangements, the need to provide this coverage extension will grow. Preferred wording, which provides the broadest possible scope of coverage, defines a domestic partner as a person qualifying as such “... under any applicable law of any jurisdiction in the world, or by common or statutory law .” 
Many insurers cover spouses within their regular de finition of “insured persons.” However, spousal 
coverage is more often available by endorsement (generally for no a dditional premium) or is provided 
by a separate provision, elsewhere in the policy.  
Coverage of Directors & Offi cers for Outside Activities  
 Recognizing  that corporate directors and officer s also sometimes serve on the boards of other 
organizations, D&O policy forms usua lly contain provisions designed  to provide coverage for these 
situations, typically in provisions termed “outsi de position management lia bility” coverage. It is 
important to mention that this provision applies only when service on such boards is at the direction of the parent organization. So, for example, there w ould be no coverage for a director who sits on the 
board of his condominium association. Rather, the intent of such provisions is to cover directors and officers who serve on nonprofit boards, usually as “r epresentatives” of the for-profit corporation on 
whose board they also serve.   
Accordingly, most D&O forms contain “built-in” poli cy provisions that provide outside directorship 
coverage for the kinds of situations  noted in the previous paragraph
. Under the minority of forms that 
do not cover this exposure automatically, such coverage can usually be obtained by endorsement.  Chapter 3—Covered Persons, Organizat ions, and Acts under D&O Policies 
 
19 
 No Coverage for For-Profit Board Service 
Coverage for service on outside boards only applies to  nonprofit boards of directors. Coverage for an 
insured's service on for-profit boards is never pr ovided under D&O policies. This is because service 
on for-profit boards generates significantly great er exposure to claim frequency and severity 
compared to service on nonprofit boards. 
Excess Coverage Application 
When it applies, outside director ship liability coverage does so onl y on an excess basis. Specifically, 
such coverage is afforded excess of: 
1. Any insurance coverage proceeds afforded to the director from the outside entity’s D&O 
policy.  
2. Any indemnification the outside entity provides to the director.  
3. Any indemnification provided by the parent or ganization (i.e., the organization covered by 
the D&O policy that affords outside position coverage).  
“Double” versus “Triple” Excess Coverage 
About half of all D&O forms provide outside dir ectorship coverage only after conditions 1 and 2 
above have been satisfied, known as “double excess” c overage. The other half provide such coverage 
only after all three conditions above have been  satisfied, known as “triple excess” coverage. 
From a practical standpoint, the outside position covera ge described above is of relatively little value. 
This is especially true when provided on a “tripl e excess basis.” Consider the following scenario. The 
CEO of Company A serves on the board of Company B. Company A's policy provides outside directorship liability coverage on a triple excess basis. Before the CEO can receive any proceeds 
under A's policy, the following three events would first have to transpire.  
• Company B's policy limits would have to be exhausted (or coverage not apply);  
• Company B would be unable to indemnify the CEO (most likely, due to insolvency); and  
• Company A would be unable to indemnify the CEO, again, most likely due to its own insolvency.  
Even if coverage were written on a double excess basis, the first two conditions (above) would have to occur. Accordingly, outside directorship liab ility coverage is usually of little practical value. 
Covered Organizations under D&O Policies 
D&O policies cover a corporation's individual directors and officers (Side A), as well as the 
organization's obligation to  indemnify these individuals (Side B). The organization is usually termed 
the “parent company” under the policy, although, technically, it is not an insured under a D&O form, 
unless the policy also provides entity secu rities liability coverage (Side C).  
 
  
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
20 Coverage of Newly Created/Acquired Entities 
The scope of coverage for the directors and officers of newly created or acquired entities has 
liberalized significantly in recent years. Previously , most insurers required notification within 30 to 
60 days of acquisition/creation and submission of underwriting data, sometimes imposed coverage 
restrictions, and frequently charged additional prem ium. Currently, many insurers afford automatic 
coverage (i.e., notification not required), provided the subsidiary's assets do not exceed 10 to 25 
percent (depending on the individual insurer) of the parent company's assets. When an entity is 
acquired with assets exceeding 25 percent of the parent organization, underwr iters generally require 
notification within 60 days, as well as additional premium, to reflect the increased exposure created 
by the acquisition.  (Absent notification in such instances, no coverage will apply to the new entity.) 
In contrast, when a new entity falls below the policy’ s stated asset threshold, no notice is required, 
other than including the new entity in details provided with the corporation’s next renewal 
application. 
Coverage Only Applies to Po st-Acquisition/Creation Acts 
An important aspect of this provision is that coverage only applies to wrongful acts that took place after acquisition or creation of the new entity. For the policy to cover acts that took place before the 
acquisition/creation, additional premium is always re quired. In effect, the automatic nature of the 
coverage provided by this provision does not apply to “prior acts.” 
Automatic Coverage Termination Provisions in Large-Scale 
Mergers/Consolidations 
Virtually all D&O policies include provisions that immediately cancel coverage in the event another 
company acquires the majority of the insured orga nization's assets. Automatic cancellation provisions 
of this kind override the normal cancellation noti ce requirements discussed later in this section of the 
course.  
Coverage Excluded for Wrongful Acts after the Acquisition 
These provisions preclude coverage for wrongful act s taking place after the date of acquisition, 
which, in theory, is not a problem. This is b ecause coverage should only be required in conjunction 
with the wrongful acts that took place before th e organization ceased to exist. For example, 
Organization A, whose D&O policy term is 1/1/2 010–11, is acquired by Organization B on October 
1, 2010. Organization A's D&O coverage under the policy automatically terminates as respect to claims from any wrongful that take place after  that date.  Accordingly, however, A will still have 
coverage for wrongful acts that took place prior  to that date, as long as they are made against the 
insured and reported to the insurer prior to the e nd of its current policy period (1/1/2010–11). Thus, 
cancellation of coverage applies only to acts that ta ke place after the acquisition, but not as to claims 
made against the insured and reported to the insurer prior to 1/1/11. In effect, the insured will have 
extended reporting coverage (a concept discussed in Ch apter 10 of this course) as to any acts that took 
place prior to October 1, 2010 and are reported to the insurer prior to January 1, 2011. 
As to acts taking place after the acquisition, Orga nization A will presumably have coverage under 
Organization B's D&O policy. 
Activating a Discovery Provision 
Another means to obtain coverage of acts prior to  the acquisition would be for Corporation A to 
activate its D&O policy's discovery provision (also known as an “awareness clause” or “notice of Chapter 3—Covered Persons, Organizat ions, and Acts under D&O Policies 
 
21 
 potential claim provision,” discussed in more detail in Chapter 10 of this course). Under a discovery 
provision, coverage will be afforded  for any incidents or circumstances that could give rise to a claim 
(regardless of how far in the future such claims ar e actually made against the insured), provided the 
insurer is notified of such incidents prior to policy termination. 
Coverage of Foreign/Non-U.S. Organizations and Operations 
Increasingly, American businesses are expanding th eir operations outside of the United States. 
Accompanying such expansion is the need to eval uate the resulting D&O exposures and to structure 
coverage that will respond appropriately. There ar e three methods of securing coverage for foreign 
D&O  organizations and operations.  
Securing Coverage under the Company’s Domestic D&O Policy 
First, coverage can sometimes be secured within the corporation's domestically issued D&O policy. 
The initial step is to make sure that the policy c ontains a “worldwide” territorial provision, so that 
coverage will apply to wrongful acts taking place and claims made, anywhere in the world. In 
addition, “foreign functional equivalent directors a nd officers” should be included within the policy's 
“insured” definition. And for such coverage to a pply, the underwriter must normally be provided with 
full details of foreign operations, as well as informa tion about persons serving on local boards in such 
countries. 
Securing Coverage under DIL/DIC Policies 
Second, a so-called difference-in-limits (DIL )/difference-in-conditions (DIC) policy can be 
purchased. Such policies function as both excess (as to limits) and umbrella (as to coverage) policies, over locally purchased insurance and as prim ary coverage within a domestic policy.  
For example, assume that a U.S. corporation con ducts operations in Brazil where it has purchased a 
local policy that only covers Brazilian operations. The policy contains a $3 million limit. Also assume 
that the corporation’s primary U.S.  policy is written with  a $10 million limit. 
A DIL/DIC policy containing a $10 million limit will fill the $7 million “gap” between the 
corporation’s $10 million primary U.S. policy and the $3 million Brazilian policy. Thus, if the Brazilian policy’s $3 million limit we re exhausted by claims, the DIL/DIC policy would provide an 
additional $7 million in limits, thereby affording the same $10 million coverage limit for Brazilian as 
for domestic exposures.  
In addition, the DIL/DIC policy affords DIC coverage breadth in the event that the Brazilian policy 
does not provide coverage for, or contains an exclus ion for, a specific type of claim that is otherwise 
covered by the primary U.S. policy. 
Securing Coverage under Locally-Admitted Policies 
Third, coverage can be secured by purchasing locally admitted policies in countries where the 
corporation has assets, operations, and local boards of directors. There are situations in which foreign, 
locally admitted coverage must be purchased, according to law. These include the following. 
• When admitted coverage is required by the law in a particular foreign jurisdiction. 
• When a foreign subsidiary has both tangible assets and a local board of directors in a foreign 
jurisdiction. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
22 Problems in Securing Local Coverage 
One problem with buying a foreign/local D&O policy is that the scope of the coverage it provides 
may be much narrower than the typical U.S.-issu ed policy, although such deficiencies can be 
remedied by buying a DIL/DIC policy, described a bove. Another drawback of buying locally issued 
policies is that when a firm is doing business in a number of countries, the administrative process of 
purchasing and maintaining numerous individual polic ies becomes unwieldy. Nevertheless, given the 
requirements that locally admitted coverage mu st be purchased in certain countries, such 
arrangements are necessary even if they are cumberso me. It is generally best if  U.S. companies 
buying international D&O coverage work with brok ers that have both international experience, as 
well as overseas offices, so that the corporation does not  have to deal with multiple brokerage firms in 
arranging coverage.  
Depending on the individual country, special rules— unlike those in the United States—may apply to 
(1) claim settlements and defense proceeds paid on  behalf of directors and officers and (2) premium 
payments. First, in a number of countries, taxes are owed when an insurer pays a claim on behalf of 
an insured director/officer. Thus, arrangements for pa ying such a tax would have to be made if, for 
example, an insurer paid $2 million to de fend or pay a claim settlement on an insured 
director's/officer's behalf. Second, in some countries,  the insured directors and officers are required to 
pay a portion of the D&O policy premiums out of their own pockets. 
Country-Specific Limits and Rest rictions on Indemnification 
A final roadblock to insuring foreign directors and officers pertains to country-specific limits and 
restrictions on indemnification. Outside of the United States, the right to indemnify directors and 
officers is often constrained, so much so that in so me jurisdictions it is against the law. For example, 
until recently, indemnification was illegal in Englan d and remains so in France. In other countries, 
indemnification may only be permitted for certa in acts but not for others (acts for which 
indemnification would be permitted in the United Stat es). For example, in some foreign jurisdictions, 
indemnification may be allowed for claims involvi ng good-faith errors in business judgment but not 
in cases where the director or officer has been char ged with illegal conduct or even gross negligence. 
The subject of international D&O coverage is co mplex. Nevertheless, as companies expand the scope 
of their operations outside the United St ates, such coverage is a necessity.  
Covered Acts under D&O Policies  
D&O policies contain a two-part wrongful act definition. The first part pertains to conduct and the 
second to status. Customarily, the de finition encompasses the following. 
1. Any actual or alleged error or misstatement or  misleading statement or act or omission or 
breach of duty by directors or officers while acti ng in their individual or collective capacities  
2. Any matter claimed against them solely by reas on of their being directors or officers of the 
company  
No Coverage for Bodily Injury and Property Damage 
Like most other forms of professional liability insurance (although architects and engineers, medical malpractice, and police professional liability coverages are notable ex ceptions), D&O coverage is not 
designed to treat exposures related to bodily injury  or property damage, an intent reflected in the 
“wrongful act” definition in the policies. In fact, separate exclusions apply to bodily injury and 
property damage claims in virtually all D&O policie s. Rather, the typical covered claims that are Chapter 3—Covered Persons, Organizat ions, and Acts under D&O Policies 
 
23 
 made against corporate directors and officers are normally based on allegations that decisions, acts, 
errors, or omissions of the directors and officers have lowered the value of the company's stock, 
compromised the company's competitive position in th e industry, wasted corporate assets, caused the 
company to forego a significant opportunity, or have otherwise injured stockholders (or others) in an 
economic or financial sense.

25 Chapter 4 
Two Key Definitions: “Claim” and “Damages” 
This chapter analyzes two key definitions include d within corporate D&O policies: “claim” and 
“damages.”  
Definition of “Claim” 
The manner in which the policies define the term “claim” is an important coverage issue. The 
broadest possible definition is ideal because such  a definition tends to accelerate the trigger of 
coverage under a D&O policy form, which is usua lly advantageous from the insured's standpoint. 
Although the exact definitions of “claim” vary from policy to policy, the following are events that 
trigger a “claim” under the typical D&O policy. 
Written Demand for Monetary  or Nonmonetary Relief 
Under nearly all D&O policies, a written, rather than  an oral, demand is required to trigger coverage. 
Such demands can seek either money damages or nonmonetary relief (e.g., a cease and desist order). 
Civil Proceeding Commenced by the Service of a Complaint 
A civil proceeding commenced by th e service of a complaint is actually a type of written demand for 
monetary or nonmonetary relief. 
Criminal Proceeding Commenced by an Indictment 
Coverage is also triggered under a D&O policy by a criminal indictment. This is important because at 
times, corporate directors and officers are indicted for criminal offenses, prior to the time in which 
civil complaints are filed against them. (Note: th e policies exclude coverage for damages alleged in 
conjunction with criminal acts. However, the policies state that defense coverage is provided when an 
insured is criminally charged, and that defense c overage continues until “final adjudication,” meaning 
the point at which the insured director/officer is acquitted, convicted, or the claim is settled.)   
Administrative or Arbitration Pro ceeding Against any Insured Person 
Administrative or regulatory agencies frequently file complaints against directors and officers; thus it 
is important for coverage to be tr iggered by such actions. In addition , requests for arbitration are also 
brought against them, often under the terms of a D& O policy, usually in the event of a coverage 
dispute. (This issue will be addressed in more de tail under the heading of “Arbitration Provisions,” 
discussed in Chapter 8 of this course.) Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
26 Civil, Criminal, Administrative,  or Regulatory Investigations 
Corporate directors and officers frequently find themse lves the target of investigations, in addition to 
having actual claims made against them. Accordingly, it is important that such actions also fall within 
a D&O policy's definition of “claim.” For example, during the summer of 2007, more than 100 
companies were under investigation by the Justi ce Department and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), regarding stock option granting practices.  
Request for Extradition or Arrest  Warrant for any Insured Person 
Occasionally, the extradition of a corporate director or officer, from a foreign country, is sought by 
legal authorities. Under some, but not all, policy form s, such actions fall within their definitions of 
“claim.” 
Not all of the foregoing elements are contained in all D&O policy definitions of the term “claim,” 
especially the last element, that for extradition requests. However, the broader the scope of the 
definition of “claim,” the more advantageous for the insured.  
Covered Damages/Covered Losses under D&O Policies 
D&O policies cover amounts paid as: (1) judgments  or settlements and (2) expenses incurred in 
defending or settling an action against the insured directors and officers or covered entity. (The 
coverage provided by a D&O policy in connection with the defense of suits will be analyzed in Chapter 6 of this course.) 
Items Excluded from “Covered Damages” Definition 
The following items generally do not fall within the typical D&O policy's definition of “covered damages” or “covered losses”: (1) sanctions, (2) taxes,  (3) fines, (4) penalties, and (5) matters deemed 
uninsurable under the law where a D&O claim is made  (which usually refers to coverage of punitive 
damages in jurisdictions where payment of punitive damages by insurance policies is not permitted). This means that even though a company's indemnifi cation agreement permits it to reimburse directors 
and officers for certain types of damages awarded in conjunction with claims against them (such as 
punitive damages), the “items excluded” portion of the company's indemnification obligation is not covered by the policy.  
“Covered Damages” Limited to Payment of Money Damages 
Standard definitions of “covered damages” and “c overed loss” also preclude coverage for injunctive 
relief, which refers to court orders  to perform certain actions or to desist from certain actions (e.g., a 
corporation may be ordered by a court to surre nder a piece of land to another corporation or 
individual, to whom the court has ruled the land rightfully belongs). In effect, the definitions of “covered damages” or “covered loss” are limited to the payment of money damages. 
Coverage of Punitive Damages 
Until the mid-1990s, punitive damages were almost universally excluded from coverage under D&O 
policy forms. There were a number of reasons for this  exclusion, one being that reinsurers would not 
cover punitive damages. In addition, some insure rs felt that affording punitive damages coverage 
defeated their purpose. Since punitive damages were  intended to punish an  insured for uncommonly 
egregious conduct, offering insu rance coverage allowed an insured to “escape” such punishment.   
(Although coverage for punitive damages could, in some instances, be obtained by endorsement and usually required payment of si gnificant additional premium.)  Chapter 4—Two Key Definitio ns: “Claim” and “Damages” 
 
27 
 However, In January 1995, Executive Re Indemnity introduced a policy containing a definition of the 
term “loss” that afforded an affirmative gran t of coverage for punitiv e damages and, shortly 
thereafter, a number of other insurers began to do likewise. Since that time, the vast majority of D&O 
policy forms either provide affirmative coverage of  punitive damages by means of inclusion within 
their “covered damages” definitions or, while not affirmatively covering them, do not specifically 
exclude them. 
State-Specific Prohibitions of Punitive Damages Coverage 
Despite such provisions, a number of states, includi ng California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, and others, prohibit insurance coverage of punitive damages. Accordingly, even if a D&O policy does not exclude, or even affirmatively covers, punitive damages, these state-specific 
prohibitions can bar payment of punitive damages. (Note: policies written in these states do not 
contain endorsements barring covera ge of punitive damages. However, given the laws in these 
jurisdictions, if the insured were to insist upon pa yment of punitive damages, the insurer would likely 
refuse to cover such damages and the insurer’s covera ge denial would be sustained in the applicable 
state court.)   
Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions 
In recent years, insurers have attempted to circumvent these state-specific prohibitions against coverage of punitive damages by means of what  are known as “most favorable jurisdiction” 
provisions. About half of all D&O policy forms are written with such a provision. To a great extent, 
insurers’ willingness to cover punitive damages, despite state-specific prohibitions, arose from intense competition in the D&O market beginning in the late 1990s.  
Most favorable jurisdiction wording states that with  respect to the insurability of punitive damages, 
the law of the jurisdiction most favorable to the insurability of punitive damages will apply, provided 
the jurisdiction has a “substantial relationship” with e ither the insured, the insurer, or to the location 
where the claim is made or occurs. The “substantial relationship” criterion is considered to be met by 
one of the following: (1) the jurisdiction where the claim for punitive damages was made; (2) the 
jurisdiction where the act giving rise to the puniti ve damages award occurred; (3) the jurisdiction 
where the insured is incorporated or maintains its  principal place of business; or (4) the jurisdiction 
where the insurer is incorporated or ma intains its principal place of business.  
Two Critical Caveats 
First, it is important to recognize that most fa vorable venue wording merely modifies the existing 
level of coverage for punitive damages already pr ovided by a D&O policy; it does not provide such 
coverage if punitive damages are otherwise excluded by a policy form. Nevertheless, if a D&O policy 
is written with punitive damages coverage, an e ndorsement providing most favored venue wording 
should, of course, be requested. 
Second, the enforceability of most favorable jurisd iction wording has never been tested in court. 
Therefore, if an insured requests such an endor sement, no additional premium should be charged, 
because the actual value of the endorsement may be  nil, until its legality is tested in court. 
   Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
28 When the Endorsement Is Important 
Most favorable jurisdiction wording is essential if, for example, a D&O claim is brought in a state 
where payment of punitive damages is prohibited by  law despite the fact that the applicable D&O 
policy provides such coverage. (As already note d, a significant minority of states, including 
California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylva nia, bar or restrict the extent to which punitive 
damages may be paid by an insurance policy.) Under these circumstances, coverage may not be 
available, even if the claim was made unde r a policy that covered punitive damages.  
Most favorable jurisdiction wording is therefor e imperative for the insured when purchasing a D&O 
policy:  
• In a state where punitive damages are not insurable and/or  
• For insureds that have multistate operations  and who therefore cannot predict where the 
claims seeking punitive damages will be brought against the insured. 
 
Chapter 4 Review Questions  
1. On reviewing his corporation’s D&O policy, Bert Dill is alarmed by the wide range of 
potential incidents that appear to qualify as clai ms. In discussing this concern with Ted, the 
firm’s insurance agent, Bert learns that: 
a. A broad definition of “claim” creates problems, because minor incidents that fit the 
definition often go unreported. 
b. A broad definition of “claim” is desirable, from the firm’s standpoint, because it means 
the policy covers a broad range of incidents. 
c. The narrower the definition of claim, the broader the coverage. 
d. The narrower the definition of “claim, ” the more expensive the coverage. 
2. A claim against the directors and officers of Worst National Bank (WNB), who were accused of abusive lending practices, is settled when the bank agrees to take the following actions. Which of these actions is most likely to be covered by WNB’s D&O insurance: 
a. WNB will cease to overcharge future borrowers. 
b. WNB will issue a public apology.  
c. WNB will pay damages to borro wers who were overcharged. 
d. WNB will return property that was wrongfully seized in settlement of a debt.

Employment Practices Liability Coverage under D&O Policies 
This chapter explains the extent to which co rporate D&O policy forms afford coverage for 
employment practices liability (EPL) claims, both within standard D&O policy forms as well as by 
means of EPL coverage endorsements that can be added to D&O policies. It also describes what are 
known as “stand-alone” EPL policies that are writte n to cover EPL claims, independent of D&O 
policies.    
EPL Coverage within  D&O Policy Forms 
An explosion in employment-related claims occurre d in the early 1990s, soon after the Clarence 
Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings. As a result, a need arose for coverage of claims 
alleging sexual harassment, wrongful termination, employment-related discrimination, and a host of 
other workplace torts. Although D&O policies were not originally designed to cover such perils, 
many corporations, when faced with employment-re lated lawsuits, sought coverage for the claims 
under their D&O policies.  
D&O Forms Do Not Exclude Employment-Related Claims 
It is important to recognize that while D&O po licy forms do not affirmatively cover employment 
practices liability lawsuits, neither do they explicitly exclude them. In  fact, to a limited extent, the 
policies actually cover them.  
EPLI Endorsements to D&O Policies 
As an alternative to purchasing EPL insurance on a stand-alone basis, insurers sometimes offer EPLI 
coverage as an endorsement to D&O forms. Typically, the coverage costs an additional 10 percent of 
the D&O premium. Lately, however, EPLI endorsements to D&O policies have actually become more popular, largely because of their cost-effectiv eness, compared to stand-alone EPLI policies.  
Nevertheless, these endorsements suffer from many  of the same coverage shortcomings as do 
unendorsed D&O policy forms, when it comes to provi ding coverage for employment-related claims. 
These shortcomings are discussed below.  
Pitfalls of D&O Coverage Endorsements 
The drawbacks associated with EPLI endorsements to D&O policies are noted in Exhibit 5.1. 
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
32 Exhibit 5.1 
Coverage Shortcomings of EPLI Coverage Endorsements  
to D&O Policies 
Limits Dilution  
EPLI endorsements do not create a separate limit of insurance. Rather, the coverage is subject to 
the existing aggregate limits available to cover cl aims against directors and officers, as well as 
securities claims against the corporate entity. A ccordingly, these limits can be diluted by EPL 
claims, something that directors and officers do not favor. 
Higher Retentions  
EPLI endorsements are subject to the same retentions as are applicable to D&O claims under 
Side B coverage, which are typically much higher  than those applicable under a stand-alone EPLI 
form (to be discussed below). Therefore, all but t he most serious EPL claims will fall below this 
figure, thereby precluding insurer reimbursement.  
Lack of Coverage for the Entity  
Although entity coverage for securities claims is available under D&O policies, allegations naming 
the corporate entity when it is a plaintiff in  an EPL suit are not covered by most EPL 
endorsements to D&O policy forms. In contrast, virtually all stand-alone EPLI forms routinely 
cover the corporate entity as a named insured. This is yet another important disadvantage of 
EPLI endorsements and many commentators sugges t that it renders the coverage offered 
relatively incomplete and therefore of little val ue because the corporate entity is almost always 
named in employment-related suits (along with indi viduals who were specifically responsible for 
causing the claim). 
Lack of Coverage for Non-directors and Non-officers  
EPLI endorsements to D&O policies create yet another critical coverage gap since only directors 
and officers are insureds under these endorsement s. Accordingly, employ ees, who are frequently 
named in EPL lawsuits, are left unc overed by these endorsements. 
Fewer Covered Perils Compared to Stand-Alone Forms 
Virtually all EPLI endorsements to D&O policy forms cover four key employment-related perils: 
wrongful termination, sexual harassment, di scrimination, and retaliation. However, EPLI 
endorsements to D&O policies generally cover only a limited number of what are referred to as 
“workplace torts.” These “workplace torts” include (but are not limited to): breach of an oral or 
written employment contract, employment-related mi srepresentation, wrongful failure to employ, 
wrongful failure to promote, wrongful disciplin e, wrongful deprivation of a career opportunity, 
failure to grant tenure, constructive discharge, negligent evaluation, invasion of privacy, 
employment-related defamation, whistle blow er claims, and employment-related emotional 
distress. Usually, an EPL endorsement to a D&O policy will only cover three to five of these 
workplace torts, compared to an average of about a dozen under stand-alone forms. 
Stand-Alone Policies Covering Employment Claims 
Given the fact that coverage of EPL claims was never really intended under D&O policy forms, 
insurance for such claims is available on a st and-alone basis under what are known as employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. A lthough such forms do a good job of filling the 
coverage gaps found within D&O policies, these st and-alone forms pose two major drawbacks: (1) 
high premiums and (2) a rigorous underwriting process requiring firms to undergo a thorough 
evaluation of their human resources administration practices. As a result, many organizations have opted not to purchase EPLI coverage or do so in  conjunction with a D&O policy, under what is 
known as an EPLI endorsement. Chapter 5—Employment Practices Li ability Coverage under D&O Policies 
33 
 EPLI Coverage within a D&O Polic y: The Package Policy Approach  
Increasingly, insurers are weaving EPLI coverage into the actual D&O policy, rather than covering 
the employment practices liability exposure by endorsement. They are doing this by means of a package policy approach in which EPL, fiduciary liability, and kidnap/ransom insurance are also 
provided along with D&O coverage. In many, although not all, such policies, each of these coverages is subject to a separate coverage limit. This is desirable for the insured because it avoids the problem 
of “limits dilution” when a D&O policy is writte n with an EPL endorsement; this situation is 
problematic for corporate insurers because  employ ment-related claims have the potential for diluting 
the limits available to cover D&O claims, something that is disfavored by corporate directors and officers. 
When assessing the scope of coverage afforded by these so-called manage ment liability “package 
policies,” it is advisable for the insured to review th e items noted above in Exhibit 5.1. The key is to 
make sure that the EPL coverage is subject to its own set of policy provisions. If this is, in fact, the 
case, the coverage is often comparable to what  is available under a stand-alone EPL form. More 
specifically, the EPL coverage should (1) be subject  to a separate policy limit (to avoid diluting D&O 
limits with EPL claims); (2) be subject to separate retentions, since D&O retentions are generally 
much higher than those under EPL forms; (3) provide entity coverage, since virtually all EPL claims 
name the corporate entity; (4) cover nondirectors/non officers in addition to directors and officers; and 
(5) cover a broad range of workplace torts in addition to discrimination, sexual harassment, 
retaliation, and wrongful termination.

35 Chapter 6 
Defense Coverage within D&O Policies 
This chapter examines the distinct nature a nd operation of defense c overage provisions and 
procedures contained within corporate D&O policies.  
Covered Defense Cost Items 
D&O policies are very similar regarding the types of  items included within the definition of “covered 
defense costs.” Essentially, the policies cover atto rney fees and investigation expenses required to 
defend and settle claims, as well as the costs of bon ds (e.g., appeal and attachment bonds) associated 
with the litigation process.  
Salaries of Insureds Are Not Considered “Covered Defense Costs” 
The most notable component that the policies spec ifically exclude from the definition of “covered 
defense costs,” however, is the salaries of directors, officers, and employees of the parent 
organization. In other words, the policy does not reimburse the parent corporation for the salaries of the directors and officers who are required to spend time working with defense counsel to adjudicate 
or settle claims. Given the high compensation levels  characteristic of insureds under D&O policies, 
uninsured compensation losses can be substantial. This is especially true considering the complex and 
time-consuming nature of D&O claims.  
Duty To Advance Defense Costs 
Historically, D&O policies did not contain language requiring the insurer to reimburse the parent organization for defense costs until a claim had b een completely resolved. However, given the 
substantial expense entailed in defending claims, even large, well-capitalized organizations would 
prefer to finance the defense of a D&O claim with  some degree of insurer assistance. Consequently, 
the majority of D&O forms contain language making it a duty for the insurer to advance or at least reimburse defense costs as they are incurred.  
Recoupment of Uncovered Defense Costs 
Where the insurer has advanced defense costs, and where the insurer has provided a defense, the issue 
that often arises is whether the insurer is entitled to  partially or completely recoup its defense costs 
from the insureds—if it turns out that one or all of th e claims were not, in fact, covered by the policy. 
An example of this would be a situation where an insured director or officer is found guilty of having 
committed fraud in a criminal trial (acts typically excluded under D&O policies) and the insurer then 
seeks a return of the monies expended to defend the insured.  
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
36 The majority of policies are silent as to whether an insurer is allowed to recoup uncovered defense 
costs that it has already paid on an insured’s behalf. Accordingly, any provisions allowing the insurer 
to recoup such costs from the insured should be vigorously resisted. Not only are they obviously 
detrimental for an insured, but are also unusual, and should be objected to on that basis, as well.  
Barring the Insurer from Enforcing Recoupment 
Ideally, wording in a D&O policy would state that the insurer is barred  from seeking such 
reimbursement. Of course, this is a favorable appr oach for the insured. Although it is difficult to 
negotiate a provision barring an insurer from seeking recoupment of noncovered defense costs, 
attempts should be made to do so nonetheless.  
Common Law Right of Recoupment: The Majority Rule 
It appears that a majority of jurisdictions allow in surers to recoup uncovered defense costs even in the 
absence of language to that effect in the policy,  especially where the insurer expressly reserves its 
right to seek such recoupment in an agreement ma de prior to advancing the defense costs. They 
reason that, if the insured does not object to the in surer's reservation of rights in that regard, the 
insured must have consented to the insurer's right to be repaid if the claims turn out to be not covered. 
Some D&O policies now contain express provisions requi ring the insureds to repay defense costs if a 
court decides that any part of them were  not covered. The D&O policy at issue in Commercial 
Capital Bankcorp, Inc. v.  St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. provides an example of such a reimbursement 
provision. 
[I]t shall be the duty of the Insureds and not the duty of the Insurer to defend any Claim. 
... 
Subject to [the allocation provision] of this Policy, the Insurer shall advance on behalf of 
the Insureds Defense Costs which the Insured Persons ... have incurred in connection 
with Claims made against them, prior to disposition of such Claims, provided that to the 
extent it is finally established that any such Defense Costs are not covered under this Policy, the Insureds ...  agree to repay the Insurer such Defense Costs. [Emphasis 
added.] 
No Common Law Right of Rec oupment: The Minority Rule 
A growing number of jurisdictions disagree with the majority rule. They read the insurer's duty to 
provide a defense to be more abso lute. They hold that, absent language in the policy itself  explicitly 
granting the insurer a right of recoupment, the insured is not required to repay defense costs even where the insurer provides a defense to the claim under a reservation of rights letter. 
Duty To Defend versus Non-Du ty To Defend Language 
D&O policies for larger, more lega listically sophisticated insured or ganizations are most often written 
on a “non-duty to defend” (also sometimes called a “dut y to pay”) basis. In contrast, smaller insureds 
who do not have the experience or time to become closely involved in the complexities of D&O 
litigation generally opt for what are known as “duty to defend” policies. In today's D&O market, 
insureds can usually choose between a “duty to defend” and a “non-duty to defend”/“duty to pay” form. 
The phrase “duty to defend” in a D&O policy expressl y states that the insurer has the duty to defend 
any claim alleging a covered act under the policy. In contrast, other policies state that the insurer has Chapter 6—Defense Covera ge within D&O Policies 
37 
 “no duty to defend” the insured; rather, such form s indicate that “it is the duty of the insured to 
defend claims.” Such forms only compel the insurer to pay the defense costs in connection with the 
insured's executing the defense of the claims. 
Who Controls Defense and Settlement? 
Two of the important differences between a “non-duty to defend” and a “duty to defend” policy 
involve (1) the right to choose defense counsel and (2) the right to control the defense of the claim. Under a “duty to defend” policy, unless specifically negotiated otherwise in the policy, the insurer has the right to choose defense counsel. In addition, under a “duty to defend” policy, the insurer typically has the absolute, unfettered right to control the defe nse strategy of the claim, including settlement.  
Conversely, under a “non-duty to defend” policy, the insured is able to use any lawyer of its choice, 
subject to insurer approval (alt hough such policies state that a pproval will not be “unreasonably 
withheld”). In addition, the policyholder has the right  to control the defense strategy and settlement of 
the claim. Accordingly, the policyholder would, for example, have the option of settling a claim 
(although it typically may not settle without first ob taining the insurer's consent; again, the policies 
state that such consent will not be “unreasonably withhe ld”) or, on the other hand, taking it to trial.  
Pros and Cons of Duty To Defend versus Duty To Pay Policies 
In many instances, a duty to defend provision may benefit an insured, despite the fact that the 
provision reduces the extent to which the insured can exert control over the claims handling process. 
This is especially true if the company is inexperienced in managing the complexities of D&O litigation. On the other hand, firms that are more fa miliar with the details of the D&O claims handling 
process may prefer a D&O policy containing duty to pay/non-duty to defend language. (This is also 
true because there is typically no difference in cost between these two kinds of policies.) In short, the 
selection of duty to defend/non-duty to defend la nguage is an organization-specific issue.  
Defense Procedures under Non-Duty To Defend Forms 
Despite the fact that a policy is written on a non-dut y to defend basis, a D&O insurer does, however, 
retain a certain amount of control over the handling of  suits brought against its insureds. For instance, 
almost all of the policies give the insurer the right  to associate with the parent company and insured 
directors and officers in defending and negotiating th e settlement of claims, even when those policies 
are written on a non-duty to defend basis.  
However, under non-duty to defend policies, if the insured is able to settle a claim within the policy's 
retention, no insurer consent is ge nerally required. In addition, the policies require insureds to provide 
the insurer with ongoing information concerning the details of the settlement process.

39 Chapter 7 
Limits, Retentions, and Coinsurance under D&O Policies 
Chapter 7 explains the manner in which limits, re tention/deductible, and coinsurance provisions apply 
within corporate D&O policies. 
Policy Limits 
D&O policies are customarily written subject to an aggregate limit applying to losses paid under any 
one of the policy's three insuring agreements: (1 ) coverage for directors/officers (Side A), (2) 
corporate reimbursement coverage (Side B), and (3) coverage for entity securities claims (Side C). In 
effect, the policy limit will be applied in any combina tion to one or more claims that are covered by 
one or more of these three insuring agreements. 
Limits under “Packaged” or “M anagement Liability” Policies 
A number of D&O policies (especially those written to cover privately held and nonprofit firms) are 
written in a “packaged” format (and are also known as “management liability policies”). Such 
policies also cover employment practices liability and fiduciary liability claims. About half of all 
“package policies” afford a separate limit for each of these three exposures, while the other half are 
written with an aggregate limit for D&O, employment practices liability, and fiduciary liability claims 
(as is the case with for-profit D&O forms.) 
Defense Costs within Limits  
D&O insurance policies include defense costs within  the policy limits, meaning that the expenditure 
of defense costs reduces the policy's limit of liability.  (This approach contrasts with that used under 
commercial general liability (CGL) policies, under which defense costs do not reduce available policy 
limits, so that in effect, under CGL policies, de fense expenses are covered to an unlimited extent.) 
Since many D&O suits involve highly complex areas of commercial and civil law, they are among the most expensive legal actions to defend. Consequently, limits should be selected not only to cover 
potential judgments and settlements, but also in cons ideration of high, anticipated defense costs, as 
well.  
   Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
40 Lack of Coverage for First-Dollar Defense 
It should also be noted that D&O policies do not a fford first-dollar defense coverage. For example, 
even if a claim were to involve only defense costs (and no judgment or settlement amount were 
payable), the insured would nevertheless be require d to absorb the amount of the policy's retention 
before the insurer would indemnify or pa y defense costs on the insured's behalf.  
Potential Bad Faith and Policy Limits  Issues under Duty To Defend Policies 
Whenever a policy is written with defense costs in cluded in the limit of liability, there are potential 
bad faith issues for insurers to consider. For exam ple, assume that a D&O policy is written with a $2 
million limit. A corporation receives a $1 million demand.  Three years later, if the insurer has already 
expended $1.5 million in defending the claim, the in surer would be unable to settle the claim within 
the policy's limits, despite the fact that the clai mant's initial demand was only $1 million (i.e., the $1 
million demand plus the $1.5 million already e xpended on defense equals  $2.5 million, which 
exceeds the $2 million policy limit).  
Note: in the above example, the insurer might, in theory, still be able to settle the claim for, say, 
$500,000 or prevail with no damages award at all—thus remaining within policy limits. Such 
outcomes are unlikely, however.  
These kinds of “shrinking limit” situations (where  defense costs reduce policy limits) place a duty on 
insurers covering insureds on a duty to defend basis, to keep insureds continually advised of current 
defense expenditure amounts so that strategic se ttlement decisions can be effectively made and 
potential bad faith claims avoided. (Normally, insure rs provide insureds with quarterly statements as 
to defense monies expended on any given claim. In th e event that insureds are not furnished with such 
information, they should request it from their insurer.) 
Of course, under non-duty to defend policies, in wh ich insureds control the defense process (and are 
therefore aware of all billings submitted to the insure r), the argument could be made that insureds are 
already cognizant of the extent to which policy limits have been reduced. Therefore, shrinking limits 
issues are less problematic under non-duty to defend policies, compared to situations in which coverage is written on a duty to defend basis.  
Retentions 
The corporate reimbursement coverage (Side B) a nd the entity securities coverage (Side C) provided 
by a D&O policy is subject to a retention. Direct coverage for directors and officers (Side A) is not 
subject to a retention. This is to the insurer's advantage because the vast majority of claims are paid under the corporate reimbursement section (Side B) of the policy. It is, of course, also advantageous for the individual directors and officers.  
Retentions in Multiple Claim Situations 
It is common for a single wrongful act to produce a number of claims (i.e., by different claimants). Without a policy provision to the contrary, this may cause retentions to “stack” on each other. To 
illustrate, if Side B of a D&O liability policy has a $500,000 per claim retention, and a single 
wrongful act leads to claims filed by three different  persons against the insureds, the parent company 
could retain as much as $1.5 million of the loss pa yments and defense costs. To prevent such 
situations, anti-stacking clauses indicating that only one retention applies per wrongful act, are 
included in virtually all D&O policies.  Chapter 7—Limits, Retentions, and Coinsurance under D&O Policies 
41 
 Even in the absence of an anti-stacking provision, near ly all courts have held that if one or more 
interrelated causes are found to have resulted in all of the injuries or damages claimed, there is but 
one loss for the purpose of determining the applicability  of retentions. Accordingly, even if a policy 
did not contain an anti-stacking provision, as a matter of common practice, a single retention would be applied if one wrongful act produced multiple claims (as in the example in the preceding paragraph).    
Coinsurance 
In addition to the retention provision explained above, a handful of directors and officers liability 
insurance policies impose a coinsu rance percentage or participa tion obligation on the insured. 
Coinsurance is normally only imposed on the most loss-prone risks and is also more common during 
hard market periods. This provision is similar to the copayment provisions found in medical insurance 
coverage, in which the policy will pay only a specified portion (typically 80 to 95 percent) of each loss in excess of the dollar amount deductible.

43 Chapter 8 
Conditions in D&O Policies 
Chapter 8 addresses the conditions provisions found in D&O forms, which include severability, 
cancellation, subrogation, other insurance, arbitr ation, priority of payments provisions, and 
presumptive indemnification provisions.    
Severability 
In a D&O policy, the term “severability” means that either (1) the application for D&O coverage or 
(2) the exclusions within a policy apply individual ly to each insured, as if a separate contract of 
insurance were in place.  
Typically, a D&O policy contains two separate severability provisions: one applying to the 
application and the other pertaining to the policy’s exclusions. 
Application Severability versu s Severability of Exclusions 
If, in a claim situation, an exclusion applies to one insured due to some action on the part of that 
insured, severability operates so that coverage is not  barred as respects other insureds. For example, if 
an officer commits fraud and, along with him, the fi rm's other directors and officers are also sued, the 
policy's fraud/dishonesty exclusion would not apply— but coverage would be available—to the so-
called “innocent insureds.” (Note: severability pr ovisions usually apply only to a D&O policy's 
conduct-related exclusions such as illegal personal profit and fraud/dishonesty and are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 9.)  
Similarly, assume that one director knew the a pplication for coverage contained a material 
misstatement (e.g., the director knew that the compa ny's financial statements contained intentionally 
inflated earnings data). This knowle dge would negate coverage for that  particular director. However, 
a severability provision stating that such knowledge was not imputable to other directors or officers 
would preserve coverage for th ese nonculpable insured persons.  
In effect, severability, as to the exclusions or the application, creates a separate policy and a separate 
application, respectively, so that the actions of  one insured do not defeat coverage for another, 
innocent insured.  
Why Has Severability Become Important? 
Severability provisions have become increasingly important in recent years because a significant 
percentage of claims against insured directors and officers have involved both so-called “white hat” 
(i.e., nonculpable insureds who did not commit fraud) a nd “black hat” insureds (i.e., culpable insureds 
who did commit fraud).  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
44 It has become commonplace for claims to be made against persons who were guilty of willful conduct 
in causing claims—along with those who were inno cent of any intentional wrongdoing. Usually, it is 
outside directors who are unaware of the fraud co mmitted by the officers who run the company's day-
to-day operations. (The Enron situation provides a good example of this situation.) However, absent 
severability of both the application for coverage and as respects policy exclusions, coverage could 
otherwise be denied as to these innocent insureds, since the wrongful know ledge/conduct of culpable 
insureds could be imputed to the innocent insureds.  
Directors and Officers Should  Review Applications 
Although the Enron case presents the most notable ex ample of the black hat/white hat dichotomy, 
many other less publicized cases in recent years have  also involved intentional, wrongful conduct by 
some insureds occurring on a parallel basis with that of other nonculpable insureds. Even where 
severability provisions appear in both D&O policy form s and applications (which is usually the case), 
it should be an established procedure within all organi zations that every insured director or officer be 
given a copy of the application, with  instructions to review it carefully. 
The Two Types of Application Severability 
There are two types of severability provisions found within D&O application forms: limited 
severability and full severability.  
Limited Severability 
Under a “limited” severability provision, severability will apply and coverage w ill be available to the 
other, “innocent” insureds, unless: (1) the person who signed the application had knowledge of the 
false application statement or (2) one of certain designated executive officers (typically the CEO or CFO) had knowledge of the false statement. Accordingly, knowledge of the false statement by either 
the signer of the application and/or the CEO or CF O will be imputed to all insureds and they will 
have no coverage. Although a minority of insu rers' applications contain limited severability 
provisions, such provisions are not unusual.  
Full Severability 
Under a “full” severability provision, which is the ma jority approach, knowledge of either the signer 
of the application or certain executive officers, such  as the CEO or CFO, is not imputed to any other 
insureds and thus, such innocent persons will have coverage despite the false statement, or knowledge 
about the false statement.  
It should be recognized, however, that a “fully severable” policy is not the same as a 
“nonrescindable” policy. “Full severability” should not be  confused with provisions barring an insurer 
from rescinding a policy based upon material, fraudulent statements in an application  As noted earlier in this course, the availability of nonrescinda ble provisions is generally restricted to Side A-
only policy forms. The lesson: simply because a polic y is fully severable does not mean that it is 
nonrescindable. 
An Instructive Case 
Cutter & Buck, Inc. v. Genesis Ins. Co.,  demonstrates the importance of the severability provision 
within a D&O application. For fiscal year 2000, Cutt er & Buck's chief financial officer accounted for 
a number of product “shipments” as “sales,” despite th e fact that distributors returned the goods in 
2001. This, of course, materially overstated the company's actual revenues. In 2002, when the firm's Chapter 8—Conditions in D&O Policies

ultimately required the company to restate its financ ials. A number of shareholder lawsuits against the 
company's directors and officers followed. Gen esis Insurance Company responded by rescinding 
coverage, asserting that the insured CFO, who w as also the signer of the D&O application and 
eventually pled guilty to fr aud, had misrepresented material facts on the application. 
The application's severability provision stated that knowledge possessed by one insured was not 
imputable to other insureds. But there was one critical exception: knowledge possessed by a signer of 
the application was imputable to innocent insureds , which was exactly what transpired in this 
situation.  
The judge found that Genesis was correct in rescindi ng coverage on this basis. Here, the wording of 
the application's severability provision did not bar Genesis from rescinding coverage for all of Cutter 
& Buck's directors and officers because the know ledge of the CFO—who signed the application—
could be imputed to others, including innocent directors and officers. 
Unfortunately, insureds will not always be offered a policy containing full application severability. In 
general, insurers are reluctant to grant it if such wording is not already contained within their standard 
application wording. Under these circumstances, insureds should take even greater care when 
completing applications to assure that all informati on contained within them is absolutely correct and 
complete.  The bottom line is that severability is not just an i ssue for the Enrons of th e business world. Rather, it 
is important for firms of all sizes to carefully address severability provisions when arranging their 
D&O coverage.  
Cancellation 
D&O policies have similar cance llation provisions, normally permitting immediate cancellation by 
the named insured with no advance notice. Unde r these circumstances, premium is returned on a 
short-rate basis (i.e., pro-rata unearned premium, le ss 10 percent). In a complimentary fashion, if the 
insurer cancels, unearned premium is returned to the insured on a pro-rata basis. 
Conversely, if the insurer cancels, 30 days is us ually the minimum notice period that most policies 
require insurers to provide insureds. Note that 10 days’ notice by the insurer is the minimum notice 
period in two situations: 
• nonpayment of premium or  
• failure to reimburse deductible amounts 
Although a majority of forms include cancellation notice provisions of 30 days, some insurers (i.e., 
most of the insurers providing coverage on adm itted forms) have state amendatory endorsements 
attached to their policies that extend cancellation notice periods to 60 days. However, a few insurers' 
policies include “regular” cancellation notice provisions as long as 60 days. 
Noncancelable Policies with Nonrenewal Notice Requirements 
Newer D&O policies provide more liberalized cancella tion provisions. That is, a number of forms are 
written on a noncancelable basis (except that cance llation is permitted for nonpayment of premium) 
and with provisions requiring the insurer to provide up to 60 days' prior notice of its intention not to 
renew the policy.  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
46 Subrogation 
Virtually all directors and officers liability polici es contain similarly worded subrogation provisions. 
The policies mandate the insureds' cooperation in r ecovering from third parties who were responsible 
for causing a claim to be made against the insureds . Such provisions reinforce the fact that the 
insureds are not permitted to prejudice the insure r's potential rights of recovery against parties 
responsible for causing a loss.  
Other Insurance 
“Other insurance” clauses in D&O fo rms state that if other insurance is available, the directors and 
officers liability policy shall serve as excess insurance. The one exception is when the other directors 
and officers liability policy is specifically sch eduled as excess of the policy in question. 
The purpose of an “other insuran ce” clause is to prevent an insure d from profiting as a result of a loss 
by collecting payment from more than one insurer. “Other insurance” clauses al so preclude an insurer 
from profiting by escaping payment of a claim it rightfully insured.  
Arbitration Provisions 
A significant number of D&O forms contain provisions requiring coverage disputes between the 
insured and the insurer be submitted to binding arbitra tion, rather than allowing either party to resort 
to the legal system to redress the dispute. (Thi s is known as a “mandatory” arbitration provision, 
although a minority of forms afford insureds the option, but not the obligation, to submit coverage disputes to arbitration.) The effect of this provi sion is to expedite reso lution of coverage-related 
controversies, given the long delays inherent in th e conventional U.S. judicial process. Also important 
is the fact that arbitration typically reduces the co st of settling such disputes compared to utilizing the 
traditional court system.  
Why Arbitration Favors the Insurer 
Although the mandatory arbitrati on provision benefits both the in surer and the insured for these 
reasons, arbitration probably affords greater benef it to the insurer. This is because it is generally 
believed that arbitrators are less biased against in surance companies than are judges and juries, as 
evidenced by the rare incidence of astronomical arbitration awards against insurers, compared to the occasional “runaway verdict” rendered by juries.  
Yet another criticism of arbitration stems from the fact  that insurers regularly hire arbitrators because 
insurers are repeatedly involved in coverage dis putes. Given their continuing need for the services of 
arbitrators, over time, insurers are in a position to hire arbitrators “more selectively,” so that 
eventually they begin hiring arbitrators whose previous decisions have tended to favor them. 
Conversely, insureds, given the rarity of their par ticipation in the arbitration process, are not in a 
position to select arbitrators whose prior decisions have  appeared to favor their interests. This is yet 
another reason why arbitration tends to favor insurers. 
Check Arbitration Provisions Carefully 
Although insureds should not anticipate becoming embroiled in a claim dispute with their D&O 
insurer, the possibility is far from remote. In fact , the 2006 Towers Perrin D&O Survey revealed that 
6 percent of open claims were being contested by participants in the survey. As expected, 47 percent 
of such disputes involved the insurer's denial of coverage for a claim. Chapter 8—Conditions in D&O Policies 
47 
 Given the reality of potential coverage disputes with a D&O insurer, it is wise for insureds to 
carefully check the dispute resolution provisions in D&O policies. Following are the points that 
demand particular scrutiny in any arbitration provision. 
Mandatory or Optional? 
Is arbitration mandatory in all instances, subject to demand by either party? Or, can it be entered into 
only at the election of the policyholder? The latter is the more favorable version for an insured, since 
there may be situations in which counsel for the in sured does not feel that arbitration is the ideal 
forum for resolving a dispute. In other words, th e best provisions from the insured's standpoint are 
those giving the insured the option but not the obligation to submit a coverage dispute to arbitration. 
Pre-Conditions to Arbitration 
Do the provisions require that the insured first subm it disputes to nonbinding mediation in an attempt 
to reach an agreement? Most do not, but a handful of forms contain such a requirement. The problem 
with this approach is that assuming each party pays  its own costs, the (usually) stronger financial 
position of the insurer may have the effect of “wearing down” the insured, thus compelling a settlement, prior to arbitration, which is  not in the insured's best interests. 
Binding or Not? 
Are the results of the arbitration binding? Under mo st, but not all, policies, arbitration is binding. 
Whether this is to the insured's or the insurer's advantage depends on the outcome of the arbitration 
and the facts underlying the dispute. 
Venue 
Does the provision state the venue in which the arbitration must take place? If so, does it favor the insurer or does it make arbitration burdensome to the policyholder? Under some policy forms, for 
example, an insured may be required to appear at  an arbitration in the United Kingdom, a situation 
that would clearly put a U.S. insured at a disadvantage. 
Controlling Law 
Is the controlling law stipulated? Again, assuming the insured is an American corporation, U.S. law in 
a specifically enumerated state, should control the arbitration proceedings rather than the law of a 
country outside the United States. 
Panel Composition 
Is the approach for selecting the arbitration pane l reasonable? Usually, the provisions call for each 
participant to appoint one arbitrator, both of whom  choose an umpire. Sometimes there is a change 
from this, whereby restrictions are placed on the background and experience of the arbitrators, and these could work to the advantage of one of the parties, usually the insurer that drafted it. 
Costs 
How are the costs of arbitration allocated between the parties? Usually, each side must pay its own 
costs. To be avoided are provisions requiring the in sureds to pay the insurers' costs, in addition to 
their own. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
48 Given the chance that an insured will, at some time, be engaged in a claim dispute with its D&O 
insurer, insureds (or their representatives) should carefully analyze these points and, if any appear 
onerous, attempt to negotiate  more favorable wording. 
Priority of Payments Provision 
When a corporation files a bankruptcy petition, it creates an “estate,” which includes all of the 
property interests of the debtor corporation at the time the bankruptcy proceeding commences. During 
the past several years, one of the critical questions that has arisen in such situations is whether the proceeds of a D&O policy should be treated as a pa rt of the bankruptcy estate, or, whether those 
proceeds are the property of the individual insu red directors and officers. If such proceeds are 
considered property of the estate, they will be s ubject to the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction and may 
not be available to pay the defense costs of the directors and officers.  
Why the Provision Is Important 
This issue, which arose during the Enron bankrup tcy, remains legally unsettled to this day. 
Accordingly, it is advantageous for a D&O policy to include a priority of payments provision which specifically states that such proceeds are the property of the directors and officers. A typical priority of payments provision states that payment will firs t be made under Coverage A, (directors & officers 
liability), then, under Coverage B (corporate reim bursement), and lastly, u nder Coverage C (entity 
securities). This is in keeping with the concep t that the primary purpo se of D&O coverage is 
protection for individual directors and officers, then  for the corporate entity, and finally, for “other 
interests” such as a bankruptcy trustee.  
Limitations of Priority of Payments Provisions 
Priority of payments provisions are helpful but far from ironclad. Although insureds should insist that 
they be included in a D&O policy, such endorsements cannot be completely relied on for two reasons. First, bankruptcy law is governed by federal statut e whereas state law is used  to interpret insurance 
policies. And since federal law takes precedence ove r state law, a bankruptcy court could decide to 
ignore a priority of payments endorsement. Second, the validity of such endorsements has not yet been examined by a court. Accordingly, if an insured requests that this provision be added by 
endorsement, no additional prem ium should be charged.  
Presumptive Indemnification Provision 
As noted earlier under the “retentions” heading earlier in this course, the typical D&O policy includes 
a substantial self-insured retention for corporat e reimbursement (Side B) coverage and Entity 
Securities (Side C) and no retention for direct (Side A) D&O coverage.  
Why the Presumptive Indemnificat ion Provision Was Introduced 
At one time, corporations attempte d to avoid paying the Side B retention by simply electing not to 
indemnify the insured directors and officers, ther eby forcing the insurer to provide first-dollar 
coverage for the directors and officers under Side A of the policy. 
In response, insurers placed “presumptive indemnific ation” provisions in D&O policies, stating that 
for the purpose of determining whether a claim is s ubject to the retention, the corporation will be 
deemed to have indemnified its directors and officer s to the fullest extent permitted by law, regardless 
of whether the corporation does, in fact, indemnify the directors and officers.  Chapter 8—Conditions in D&O Policies 
49 
 When the Provision Does Not Apply  
It is important to recognize, however, that presu mptive indemnification clauses typically do not apply 
when insolvency prevents the co rporation from meeting its indemnity  obligations. Accordingly, one 
might think that directors and officers will also  enjoy virtual first-dollar coverage when the 
corporation has filed for bankruptcy, which, in f act, may not necessarily be the case. Rather, there are 
times when a currently solvent company will file for bankruptcy to forestall a potential risk of future 
insolvency. As a result, if a corporation files for bankruptcy, but is not actually insolvent, an insurer 
could argue that the presumptive indemnification cl ause requires the insureds to assume liability for 
the self-insured retention.  
Given this possibility, when negotiating the wordi ng of a D&O policy (especially if there is a 
possibility of a future bankruptcy filing), the corpor ation should ask the insurer to use language that 
eliminates the presumption of indemnification on filing of bankruptcy, as well as when the 
corporation is insolvent. 
 
Chapter 8 Review Questions  
1. Careful reading of J-Fly Company’s D&O policy suggests that, no matter how innocent he or she might be, no director or officer of the company is entitled to protection under the policy if the CEO or CFO knows that the insurance app lication contains false statements. Based on 
this information, it appears that J-Fly’s D&O policy has: 
a. a broad severability provision. 
b. a full severability provision. 
c. a limited severability provision. 
d. no severability provision. 
2. A typical D&O policy includes provisions that:  
a. clarify the policy’s relationship with other insurance and require cooperation with the 
insurer’s subrogation efforts. 
b. permit other D&O insurance but prohibit subrogation.  
c. permit subrogation but proh ibit other D&O insurance. 
d. prohibit subrogation by the insurer and pr ohibit other insurance covering the same 
exposures. 
3. When comparing arbitration provisions in D&O policies from the standpoint of the insured, 
a. all arbitration costs should preferably be paid by the insured. 
b. mandatory arbitration is preferable to optional arbitration.  
c. restrictions on the composition of the arb itration panel usually favor the insurer. 
d. the venue in which the arbitration must take place is not a relevant factor. 
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
50 Answers to Chapter 8 Review Questions 
1. c. Under a “limited” severability provision, severab ility will apply and coverage will be available to 
the other, “innocent” insureds, unless: (1) the person who signed the application had knowledge of the 
false application statement or (2) one of certain designated executive officers (typically the CEO or 
CFO) had knowledge of the false statement. 
2. a. Other insurance clauses state that the policy prov ides excess coverage (subject to one exception) and 
requires the insured to cooperate with th e insurer’s third-party recovery attempts. 
3. c. Restrictions on the background and experience of the arbitrators usually work to the advantage of 
the insurer that drafted the restrictions in the policy. 
 
   
 
   
51 Chapter 9 
Exclusions in D&O Policies 
Chapter 9 examines the exclusions foun d within corporate D&O policies.  
Exclusions are incorporated into directors and offi cers liability policies in one of two ways: (1) they 
are contained within the policy form or (2) they are added to the policy by endorsement. Both types of 
exclusions can have a significant effect on the scope of coverage the policies provide. Since D&O 
policies vary more in their exclusionary language th an in any other coverage aspect, it is necessary to 
examine the exclusions carefully. 
It is also important to note that the exclusions in a D&O form are not always contained in the policy 
section titled “Exclusions.” They may also be contained within definitions (e .g., “loss” defined to 
exclude fines and penalties) as well as in the conditions section. 
D&O Forms Containing Multip le Sets of Exclusions 
A number of D&O policies incorporate as many as thr ee sets of exclusions: one set applicable to the 
corporate reimbursement section of the policy, a second set applicable to the coverage for directors 
and officers, and a third set applicable to the policy's entity securities coverage section. 
It should be recognized that a corporation's bylaws and state statutes governing corporate 
reimbursement plans impose many of the same restrictions found in the directors and officers coverage exclusions. For this reason, these exclusions  do not always need to be included in the set of 
exclusions that pertain to the corporate reimburse ment coverage section. As a result, a number of 
D&O policies contain only a single set of exclusions  that apply to the corporate reimbursement, the 
directors and officers, and the entity securities c overage sections (i.e., Coverages A, B, and C). 
Severability Provisions in Policy Exclusions 
As discussed earlier, by virtue of what are known as severability provisions, for the purpose of 
applying D&O policy exclusions, the actions of one director or officer are not normally imputed to any other directors or officers. For example, assume that a claim alleges dishonest acts were 
committed by a group of directors and officers. If only one of these individuals was, in fact, proven 
guilty of the dishonesty, based upon the severability provision applying to the policy's exclusions, the 
innocent directors/officers would not be barred from having defense coverage available for the claim. 
This is because the provision states that the dishonest acts of the guilty director/officer will not be imputed to the innocent director(s), so as to bar coverage for these individuals.  
Severability provisions are also sometimes referr ed to as “innocent director” or “nonimputation” 
clauses. (The concept of severability regarding statem ents made in connection with the application for 
a D&O policy was examined earlier in this course.) Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
52 Exclusions for Which Severability Provisions Usually Apply 
Insurers typically include severability provisions  with respect to the following exclusions. 
• Fraud/Dishonesty  
• Personal profit  
• Illegal payments and gratuities 
• “Short Swing” profits  
• Return of remuneration  
Care should be taken to verify that severability provisions also apply to any similar kinds of 
exclusions that may be added to the D&O policy by endorsement.  
The following pages will discu ss these specific exclusions: 
• Claims caused by director/officer fraud/dishonesty 
• Personal profit exclusion 
• Illegal payments and gratuities exclusion 
• Exclusion of claims under Section 16(b) of  the 1934 SEC Act (“Short Swing” Profits) 
• Exclusions relating to various corporate activities 
• Return of remuneration exclusion 
• Prior and pending litigation exclusion 
• Exclusion of losses covered by a prior policy 
• Insured versus insured exclusion 
• Failure to maintain insurance exclusion 
• Wage and hour claim exclusion 
• ERISA liability exclusion 
• Bodily injury/property damage/personal injury exclusion 
• Pollution exclusion 
Exclusion of Claims Caused by  Dishonesty of Directors and 
Officers 
Insuring people for their individual liability arisi ng out of intentionally committed illegal acts is not 
permitted as a matter of public policy. Accordingly,  D&O policies exclude coverage for dishonest, 
fraudulent, malicious, and criminal acts co mmitted by insured directors and officers. 
“Final Adjudication” versus “In Fact” Wording 
There are two versions of the dishonesty exclusi on in D&O policies. The first requires a “final 
adjudication” before it can be applied. This versi on is viewed as being more favorable to the insured 
because it implies that the claim has reached a defin ite conclusion (i.e., a settlement or a judgment).  Chapter 9—Exclusions in D&O Policies 
53 
 The second version requires that the dishonesty be  established “in fact,” which sets up a lower 
standard of proof compared to the first version. This is because it does not sp ecify that the claim has 
reached a final outcome.  
In addition, there is a certain degree of ambiguity associated with “in fact” language compared to the 
“final adjudication” version of this exclusion. More specifically, if “in fact” means something less 
than a “final adjudication,” how and when does the insurer establish the misconduct precluded by the 
exclusions occurred “in fact”?  
• Upon testimony or document production dur ing the discovery phase of litigation?  
• Through facts uncovered by the insure r during its own investigation?  
• At trial, where, arguably, facts are establishe d for the first time through admitted evidence?  
A final problem associated with “in fact” language is the question of who determines when dishonest 
conduct has “in fact” occurred? Although not specifi ed in the policy language, one insurer that has 
used “in fact” wording for many years has in the past advised its policyholders that it would not 
unilaterally apply these exclusions. Rather, it would seek the intervention of a third party, such as an 
arbitrator, to decide whether the misconduct had “in fact” taken place.  
In short, given these ambiguities, “final adjudication” wording is more favorable for the insured, 
compared to “in fact” wording, and should always  be preferred when comparing the wording of the 
dishonesty exclusion. And for this reason, “in fact” wording is rarely found in policies that have been issued within the past 5 years.  
Coverage for Defense 
By inference, the wording of the dishonesty exclusion indicates that the D&O policy covers the cost of a successful defense against char ges of dishonest conduct on the part of a director or officer. In 
addition, defense coverage is availa ble if a settlement is made without admission of liability (which is 
typically the case in settlement agreement language).  The availability of defense coverage in these 
instances is critical because the majority of clai m allegations made against insured directors and 
officers contain specific charges that dishonest  conduct was responsible for causing a loss. 
“Final Adjudication” Wording in C onduct Exclusions May Not Always Be 
Advantageous 
Traditionally, and as already discussed, “final adjudication” wording is considered preferable for the insured. But in recent years, the supposedly insured-friendly “final  adjudication” wording has, in 
some cases, had the opposite effect. Former Enr on CFO Andrew Fastow pleaded guilty in criminal 
proceedings associated with Enron's bankruptcy. Yet since the Enron D&O policy forms were written 
on a “final adjudication” basis, the insurer conti nued to defend Mr. Fastow against civil lawsuits 
because his conduct still had not been subject to “f inal adjudication.” This was because although Mr. 
Fastow had pleaded guilty to criminal charges, he had not yet been sentenced and, until that time, could still change his plea. But by continuing to defend Mr. Fastow, other far less culpable directors 
and officers had their remaining policy limits depleted. 
The solution? Consider negotiating to have the conduc t exclusions worded so that defense coverage 
continues until “final determination” rather than “final adjudication.” “Final determination” still 
solves the problems associated with the finding “i n fact” approach but also avoids the problem of 
having to wait until an actual criminal sentence is  handed down before defe nse can be terminated. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
54 Such a provision would have cut off defense funds for Mr. Fastow, while maintaining their 
availability for other, far-less-culpab le insureds under Enron’s policy.  
Personal Profit Exclusion 
Another exposure considered to be uninsurable invol ves claims that directors or officers have gained 
illegal personal profit or advantage to which they we re not legally entitled. For example, an outside 
director may also be the owner or major stockholder of a firm that is bidding on a contract proposal 
offered by the parent organization. If the director's company wins the bid because it was proven that 
the director was privy to the bids submitted by competitor firms, a claim of illegal personal profit could be made and if a lawsuit were filed as a result, the director would not have coverage. 
“In Fact” Wording Is Preferable 
The most favorable versions of this exclusion state that coverage for illegal personal profit is 
excluded, but only if such profit was gained “in fact ” by an insured. The implication is that defense 
coverage to allegations of  personal profit is covered by the polic y until it is factually established that 
the insured gained illegal personal profit.  
Full Severability Usually—But Not Always—A pplies to the Personal  Profit Exclusion 
In TIG Specialty Ins. Co. v. Pinkmonkey.com, Inc.,  375 F.3d 365 (5th Cir. 2004), the CEO personally 
profited from the wrongful sale of stock. However,  the personal profit exclusion applied whenever 
“an insured” personally profited from the alleged wr ongful conduct. The court held that, under such 
wording, coverage was precluded for all insureds, not just the culpable CEO.  (It should be 
recognized that such severability language is unus ual, although insurers do occasionally use it.) 
On the other hand, had the exclusion been worded  so that it applied only when “the insured” 
personally profited from wrongful conduct, it is likely that the court would have ruled differently, that 
except for the culpable CEO, coverage would apply to the other, “innocent” insureds. The lesson for 
insureds is that they should avoid severability langua ge in conduct exclusions  that precludes coverage 
when “an insured” is guilty of wrongful conduct.  Instead, they should request language precluding 
coverage only when “the insured” has committed such acts. Language of this kind will then allow the 
severability provision to function as intended, whereby “innocent insureds” will not lose coverage. 
Illegal Payments and Gratuities Exclusion 
This exclusion is sometimes called the “payments and commissions” exclusion.  It excludes claims relating to the insured’s receiving or making payments that are prohibited by law.  
The exclusion originated as a result of the Fore ign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prohibits 
bribes, political contributions, gratuities, and other pa yments to foreign or domestic officials. The Act 
was passed as a result of SEC investigations in the mid-1970s. Ultimately, these investigations 
revealed that more than 400 U.S. corporations admitted making questionable or illegal payments in 
excess of $300 million to foreign government officials, politicians, and political parties. The abuses were widespread and included such acts as: bribery of high foreign officials to obtain various forms 
of favorable action or consideration by a fore ign government, as well as so-called “facilitating 
payments,” made to ensure that government officials performed certain accounting and bookkeeping duties that were essential to the co mpletion of various business deals.  Chapter 9—Exclusions in D&O Policies 
55 
 However, it should be emphasized that the exclusi on prohibits coverage not only for illegal payments 
in conjunction with the Foreign Co rrupt Practices Act of 1977, but as respects any other applicable 
laws. 
The exclusion is not usually incorporated into th e text of policy forms but appears with sufficient 
regularity as an endorsement to be deserving of special mention and is also normally subject to 
severability provisions. Thus, if a claim of having arranged illegal payments we re made against five 
directors and officers, but only one had actually done so, defense coverage would apply to the four innocent insureds.   
Exclusion of Claims under Section 16(b) of the 1934 SEC Act 
(“Short Swing” Profits) 
Profits made from the director or officer’s personal sale of stock in his or her own company, if the 
stock has been held for less than 6 months (referred to as “short swing” profits), are prohibited by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Virtually all D& O policies exclude coverage of claims alleging 
violation of this rule. However, insurers usually provide coverage of defense costs when allegations 
of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 vi olations are successfully defended.  
Exclusions Relating to Ce rtain Corporate Activities  
Related to exclusions pertaining to “short swing” profits, are those sometimes imposed for other, 
specified corporate activities. In mo st instances, such exclusions find  their way into policies by means 
of standard or manuscript endorsements, rather than  via standard policy wording. However, in some 
unusual instances, these restrictions are also included within regular policy forms. Either way, they 
can eliminate coverage for significant D&O exposures. Following are several of the most important types of such exclusions. 
Claims from Going Private/Leveraged Buyouts 
During periods of high private equity activity, such restrictions can easily find their way into D&O policies. This is especially true, since stockholders  frequently allege conflicts of interest and self-
dealing in claims associated with private buyout s. (Private equity firms purchase the shares and 
ultimately gain control of publicly held companies.  The private equity group eventually resells the 
company at a later date, hopefully for a higher price per share than the one for which it was originally 
acquired on the public market.) 
Claims from Mergers & Acquisitions 
Although these transactions do not involve a private buyout, they nevertheless create the distinct 
possibility that stockholders of the acquired firm will allege that they were insufficiently compensated 
for their shares by the acquiring firm as a part of the merger or acquisition. 
Claims from Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) 
Claims associated with IPOs are most often made  by purchasers of the newly-public shares who 
assert that the offering prospectus did not present a true picture of the company. Accordingly, D&O 
forms written for private companie s (which are discussed later in this course) should be checked 
carefully for any restrictions or exclusions relati ng to claims from IPOs, since, during a policy period 
but well after having signed an application for c overage indicating no plan to do so, the company 
could decide to float a public offering of its shares. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
56 Claims from Joint Ventures or Partnerships 
At times, corporations will operate a joint vent ure or partnership with another organization for a 
short-term, time-limited business purpose. Underwri ters sometimes preclude coverage for joint 
ventures by means of “insured” definitions within their policy form. Accordingly, such definitions 
should be checked and consideration given to negotia ting to include the joint venture or partnership as 
an insured under the policy. 
Although additional premium may be required to remove these types of restrictions and exclusions, it 
may be well worth the cost, given the high clai m potential inherent in such circumstances. 
Return of Remuneration Exclusion 
Most D&O policy forms exclude coverage for moni es paid to a director or officer without 
stockholders' approval. However, some D&O policie s incorporate an important exception to this 
exclusion by making it apply only when remunerati on has been held by a court to be illegal. If 
possible, the exclusion should contain wording to this effect, which would make defense coverage 
available until an allegation of illega l remuneration is actually proven.  
Origins of the Return of Remuneration Exclusion   
Originally, the exclusion of illegal remuneration was not commonly found in D&O forms since, 
under SEC rules, the compensation paid to directors or officers was not subject to shareholder approval. However, concern about excessive compensation of management commencing in the early 1990s has prompted a change in SEC rules, which now permit greater shareholder involvement in the 
setting of compensation for top executives. Given the degree of controversy surrounding this topic, more claims alleging illegal remuneration can be expected in the coming years. 
This, again, is an exclusion to which seve rability applies in almost all policies.  
Prior and Pending Litigation 
Nearly all D&O policy forms exclude claims aris ing from litigation that was pending prior to the 
inception of the policy or was pending prior to the policy's “prior and pending litigation date” (a date which is normally included on the declarations page of the policy or added by endorsement). The intent of this exclusion is to avoid insuring the so -called “burning building,” whereby the insurer must 
cover claims from events that were lacking in fortuity and that sometimes provide the incentive for an insured to obtain coverage.  
How the Prior and Pending Litigation Exclusion Applies 
A prior and pending litigation exclusion would apply if litigation against a corporation—rather than 
individual directors and officers—was pending prior to the inception of a D&O policy. If the lawsuit is amended after inception of the policy, so that it now names the organization's directors and officers, 
the prior and pending litigation ex clusion would preclude coverage for the amended version of the 
claim.  
An Example 
On July 1, 2008, a borrower whose home has b een foreclosed on by XYZ Bank files a lawsuit 
alleging breach of contract against the bank. The suit alleges that the bank misrepresented the actual 
terms of the loan when the closing papers were signed, because the papers failed to state explicitly 
that after 2 years, the monthly payment would double. (Note that a breach of contract lawsuit against Chapter 9—Exclusions in D&O Policies 
57 
 the bank would not be covered by a D&O policy b ecause Coverage C, Entity Coverage, applies only 
to claims involving the securities of the insured cor poration, in this example, shares of the bank’s 
stock.) On January 1, 2009, the borrower amends th e lawsuit to also name the bank's directors and 
officers. (In contrast, this claim would be covered,  because coverage applies under Coverages A or B, 
for any cause of action.) A week after receiving the suit papers, the directors and officers file the 
claim with their D&O insurer under their January 1, 2009–January 1, 2010 policy. However, if the bank's January 1, 2009–January 1, 2010 policy c ontained a prior and pending litigation exclusion, 
coverage will be denied since the claim arose out of a lawsuit that was pending prior to the inception 
of that policy (i.e., the “original” breach of contract lawsuit was filed on July 1, 2008.) 
Modifying the Prior and P ending Litigation Exclusion 
Often, insurers will agree to modify the prior and pending litigation exclusion so that it only applies 
to litigation pending prior to the inception date of the present insurer's first D&O policy. Given this 
modification, any litigation originally initiated dur ing the present insurer's stream of protection will 
not be excluded. This is a reasonably negotiable item and can usually be ach ieved without additional 
premium. This modification can be accomplished by having the policy's “prior and pending litigation 
date” be the same as the inception date of the current  insurer's first D&O policy. Using the example in 
the above paragraph, if the insurer first began writi ng coverage for the insure d on January 1, 2008 and 
the prior and pending litigation date on the policy was also January 1, 2008, the prior and pending 
litigation exclusion would not bar coverage for the cl aim, since the original litigation was not pending 
prior to January 1, 2008. On the other hand, if the prior and pending litiga tion date on the 1/1/09–10 
policy described above was January 1, 2009, no c overage would have applied since the litigation 
actually began on July 1, 2008—a date preceding the January 1, 2009, prior and pending litigation date. As a general rule, from the insured’s standpoin t, the prior and pending litigation date should be 
as early in time as possible. 
Removing the Exclusion in Renewal Policies 
Insureds should also attempt to have the prior and pending litigation exclusion removed in renewal 
policies. The purpose of the exclusion is to avoid ha ving the insurer cover situations that the insured 
knew or suspected would eventually result in a clai m against the corporation's directors and officers. 
Accordingly, after the policy has been  in force for a year, this possib ility is greatly reduced, if such a 
claim has not yet been made. Thus, at the first rene wal, the insured should request that the prior and 
pending litigation exclusion be removed.  
Exclusion of Losses Insured by a Prior Policy 
Most D&O forms contain exclusions precluding covera ge for claims that have already been reported 
under prior policies, written either by the current insure r or by a previous insurer. Such exclusions are 
necessary to prevent insureds from reporting a claim—for the second time—under current policies 
with higher limits or broader c overage provisions, than those in prior years, when claims were 
previously reported. 
For example, an insured reported a claim during the term of Insurer A’s policy (1/1/10–11). The 
policy’s limit was $5 million. For the 1/1/11–12 term , the insured purchased a policy containing a $10 
million limit, from Insurer B.  This exclusion prevents the insured from obtaining coverage under a 
policy with a higher limit (i.e., $10 million), by reporti ng the same claim to Insure r B, if, for instance, 
the claim turned out to require more  than Insurer A’s $5 million limit.  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
58 Insured versus Insured Exclusion 
Insured versus insured exclusions preclude coverage for claims made by one insured under a D&O 
policy, against another. An example of an insured versus insured claim (that would be excluded) is 
one in which corporate director “A” sues corporat e director “B” because of a bad business proposition 
that “B” advised the company to pursue, such as urgi ng the acquisition of a subsidiary that eventually 
produced a significant loss for the company. 
Rationales for the Exclusion 
There are several rationales for the insured vers us insured exclusion in D&O policy forms.  
No Intent To Cover Recoupment for Bad Business Decisions 
The insured versus insured exclusion was original ly introduced in the 1980s, when Bank of America 
began suing a number of its loan officers for lo sses caused by imprudent extensions of credit. In 
response to these lawsuits, the officers then sought coverage under Bank of America's D&O liability policy. However, the bank's insurer did not intend for the policy to function as an indemnification 
vehicle for bad business decisions. (Insurers viewed such claims as affording coverage for “business 
risk,” rather than for professional negligence). So in response, D&O insurers began inserting insured 
versus insured exclusions within their policy fo rms (a practice which was later extended to other 
kinds of professional and manage ment liability policy forms).  
Other, More “Specific” Insu rance Coverage Available 
Since many insureds also purchase stand-alone employment practices liability (EPL) coverage, D&O liability insurers feel that employment-related cl aims by one insured against another (which, for 
example, would preclude coverage if a CEO who is terminated, sues the other directors and officers) 
are more appropriately covered by stand-alone EPL policy forms.  
No Coverage Intended for “Infighting” 
Yet another rationale for not cove ring claims made by one insured pe rson against another is that, at 
times, such lawsuits are the result of “infighting” by  one insured against another. For example, in an 
attempt to force a director to resign because of a personality conflict, the other directors sue him for 
negligence, alleging that he does not cont ribute adequately at board meetings.  
Key Exception Wording  
Despite the rationales for excluding claims by on e insured against another, the policies contain 
“exception wording,” which has the effect of providing  coverage for certain kinds of claims in which 
one insured sues another insured. Under the followi ng circumstances noted below, most but not all 
D&O policies “except,” and therefore cover, the following claim situations.  
Derivative Actions 
These actions are brought by one or more stockholders, on behalf of the corporation. Any recovery in 
a derivative suit inures to the benefit of the corporation itself as opposed to the individual 
shareholders who institute the action (i.e., the pro ceeds of a successful derivative suit are paid to the 
corporation). If, for example, a director or officer were to bring a derivative suit, the insured versus 
insured exclusion would not apply to the claim a nd coverage for the claim would be available.  
 Chapter 9—Exclusions in D&O Policies 
59 
 Employment-Related Claims 
Claims by one director/officer against another are not excluded if they involve employment-related 
matters. For example, an officer of a corporation sues the other officers and directors, alleging that he was wrongfully terminated. When an insured pur chases the employment practices liability coverage 
endorsement, discussed later in this chapter, this exception wording must be added to the policy—if it 
is not already included—to preserve the protecti on that is intended to be provided by the 
endorsement. On the other hand, if an insured has purchased a stand-alone employment practices liability policy, the lack of exception wording as it would pertain to lawsuits by one insured 
director/officer against another (and consequent lack of coverage for such suits under the D&O 
policy), is not a problem. This is because covera ge for these claims would be available under the 
stand-alone employment practices liability policy.  
Claims for Contribut ion or Indemnity 
This refers to a situation where one director or offi cer is sued and then, by means of another lawsuit, 
attempts to have other directors and officers contribute monies for his defense and/or payment of the claim. Coverage for these types of situations are ex cepted by most versions of the insured versus 
insured exclusion.  
Claims by Bankr uptcy Trustees 
In recent years, bankruptcy trustees have made numerous claims against directors and officers. Bankruptcy trustees should not be considered to be  insureds under D&O policies and therefore, most 
policy forms cover such claims by “excepting” them  from the insured versus insured exclusion.  
Claims by Past Insureds 
This refers to claims made by pe rsons who have not served as a director or officer for a period of at 
least 5 years (provided they are not bringing the cl aim with the assistance of, or at the urging of a 
person who is currently serving as a director or officer). Given the 5 year time lapse, such claims are rarely motivated by either collusion or by infi ghting and are therefore excepted from the insured 
versus insured exclusion.  
Claims Brought Outside the United States 
The most frequent situation in which this excepti on applies, and coverage is afforded, would be a 
claim brought by a director or officer of a foreign subsidiary and filed outside the United States 
against the company's U.S. directors and officers.  
Failure to Maintain Insurance 
A number of D&O policies contain an exclusion of cl aims alleging loss due to the failure of directors 
and officers to maintain property and liability insu rance coverage. The following scenario illustrates 
the way in which a “failure to maintain insura nce” exclusion could come into play in a claim 
situation. Assume that an organization with a large insured property schedule either has inadvertently 
omitted an individual property from the schedule or  perhaps does not have the correct scope of 
property insurance coverage on this singular locati on (e.g., there is no coverage for flood on a given 
manufacturing plant). The property suffers damage and is not insured, resulting in financial loss to the 
organization. This loss leads to litigation alle ging director/officer negligence in managing the 
corporation's insurance program. If the D&O polic y contained a failure to maintain insurance 
exclusion, the D&O insurer would be likely to deny the claim. In fact, taken literally, the D&O Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
60 insurer could deny almost any claim for which there would be insurance available, somewhere, and at 
some price. (And are most exposures not at least somewhat insurable somewhere and for some 
price?) The vagueness of the language of the excl usion, accompanied by the eagerness of many D&O 
insurers to deny claims, are reasons for concern regarding this language. 
Katrina Disaster Underscores the Dangers of Failure To Insure Exclusions 
If there were ever a time when an insured would not want a failure to maintain insurance exclusion in 
a D&O policy, it would be in the aftermath of a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina. Firms with substantial operations in the affected area were al most certain to suffer considerable property damage 
and business interruption losses—even if insurance coverage was in place—given deductibles/retentions, coinsurance provisions, a nd valuation clauses that produce less than full 
replacement cost recoveries. 
But for any firms that lacked flood coverage or had inadequate or no property and/or business income 
policies at the time of the hurricane, lawsuits by investors could allege managerial negligence in 
failing to obtain appropriate covera ge. Under these circumstances, a failure to maintain insurance 
exclusion in a D&O form could prove problematic. 
Removing the Exclusion 
Given the problems this exclusion could generate , insureds should present the D&O insurer with a 
complete schedule of insurance coverage, along with a discussion of the corporation's risk management program. Based on this material, the in sured will be in a better position to negotiate the 
removal of the exclusion.  
Terrorism and the Failure To Maintain Insurance Exclusion 
Within the past several years, coverage for terro rism has become available under commercial general 
liability (CGL) and property insurance policies. Re grettably, many insureds have received premium 
quotations for such coverage that range from high to prohibitively hi gh. Faced with this situation, 
corporate risk managers are making well-researche d, carefully-reasoned decisions not to purchase 
terrorism coverage. But should such companies suffer an uninsured terrorism loss, lawsuits alleging that directors and officers were negligent in failing to purchase coverage may result. 
In an effort to prevent these problems, if the failure to maintain insurance exclusion cannot be 
removed, the insured should request that it be modi fied so there is an exception for claims alleging 
negligent failure to buy coverage  for terrorism. (However, such an  exception would still not prevent 
an insurer from denying coverage for failure to buy any other types of insurance coverage.)  
Exclusions for Insurance-Related Operations 
A few versions of the failure to maintain insura nce exclusion also contain restrictions on claims 
involving the insured's involvement with risk-beari ng operations such as captive insurance companies 
and risk retention groups. Both for-profit and nonpr ofit organizations sometimes band together with 
firms in similar industries and form such risk-b earing entities. Separate c overage is required to 
provide coverage for such operations.  
  
 Chapter 9—Exclusions in D&O Policies 
61 
 Wage and Hour Claims Exclusion 
Some D&O policies exclude coverage for wage a nd hour claims. Such claims most commonly arise 
from an employer's alleged failure to pay overtim e to what should have been treated as nonexempt 
employees. All employees are either “exempt” or  “nonexempt.” Although those terms have many 
implications, the most important is that exempt employees (e.g., professional staff employed on a 
salaried basis) need not be paid overtime. Wage a nd hour claims most often occur when an employee 
complains about not getting paid overtime to an attorn ey who then, after the interview, realizes that 
he may have a six-figure class action claim on his hands. 
The exclusion of wage and hour claims first beca me an issue of urgent concern on July 10, 2001, 
when a California jury returned a $91 million verdic t against a company (Farmers Insurance) that had 
improperly classified its claims adjusters as exempt. Numerous high-dollar settlements against a 
number of national companies, including Rite Ai d ($25 million), U-Haul ($7.5 million), and Taco 
Bell ($13 million), have since followed. More r ecently, Staples paid $38 million—more than $22,000 
to each “assistant manager” who allegedly was misc lassified as an exempt employee under overtime 
laws.  
There is an overtime exemption for executive, administrative, professional, and outside sales 
employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA ) and most state guidelines. To be exempt, these 
employees must meet certain tests regarding job duties and responsibilities and be compensated “on a 
salary basis” at not less than stated amounts. Howeve r, such tests are often confusing. Indeed, the 
issue of who is an “exempt” employee is not always clear-cut. 
Modifying the Exclusion 
Although there is not much an insured can do about the standard wage and hour exclusion, wording 
should be requested that modifies the exclusion so th at it does not apply to claims associated with the 
federal Equal Pay Act of 1963. This law, which pr ohibits sex-based discrimination in determining the 
wages of male and female employees, mandates e qual pay for both sexes when work involves equal 
levels of skill, effort, and responsibility and does not involve the types of wage and hour claims 
already discussed. However, absent a clarifying endorse ment to this effect, an insurer could stretch 
the intended scope of this exclusion so that it extends beyond prohibiting merely a garden-variety 
wage and hour claim. 
Favorable Exception Wording 
One final point is that many versions of this  exclusion “except” and therefore provide defense 
coverage for allegations that a cor poration or its directors and officers have conspired to violate wage 
and hour laws, which is favorable for the insured. The exception also applies to, and therefore covers, both defense and indemnity costs associated with 
wage and hour claims, if such claims fall within the purview of Side A (i.e., directors and officers 
liability) coverage. 
    
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
62 ERISA Liability Exclusion 
Claims are excluded under a D&O policy if they are based on a director's or officer's responsibilities 
as a fiduciary as defined in the federal Employee Re tirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 
or similar laws. ERISA and other liability exposures associated with administration of corporate pension plans, profit sharing, and employee bene fit programs are insurable under separate fiduciary 
liability policies (discussed in a separate course within this series). Certain variations of this exclusion 
also preclude coverage for benef its due under a number of federal,  state, and local labor-related 
statutes such as the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and others.  
Bodily Injury/Property Damage /Personal Injury Exclusion 
Claims alleging the following are excluded under almost all D&O policy forms. 
• Bodily injury (including sickness, disease, and death)  
• Damage to or loss of use of tangible property  
• Libel or slander  
• Emotional distress  
• Other common personal injury perils (i.e., false arrest, assault)  
The purpose of the bodily injury/property damage lia bility/personal injury exclusion in D&O forms is 
to avoid an overlap in coverage between an insu red's D&O policy and its commercial general liability 
(CGL) policy.  
Two Key Variations of the BI/PD/PI Exclusion 
There are, however, two distinct versions of this  exclusion. Preferably, the exclusion should be 
worded so that it applies only to claims “for bodily injury and property damage” and not “to claims based upon, arising out of, or in any way related to  bodily injury or property damage.” 
The latter, “based upon, arising out of, or in any wa y related to” version shoul d be avoided. This is 
because such wording could eliminate coverage not on ly for claims by persons suffering bodily injury 
or property damage (a CGL exposure), but also w ith respect to secondary claims by stockholders who 
sustain financial loss resulting from the bodily injury or property damage of ot hers (e.g., shareholders 
in an oil company suffer financial losses when a major refinery is blown up by terrorists). Such secondary claims are not covered under a commercial general liability policy, thus creating a gap in 
coverage if this wording is included. 
BI/PD/PI Exclusionary Wordi ng and Its Effect on Terrorism 
D&O insurers have not added terrorism exclus ions to D&O forms. Nevertheless, a bodily 
injury/property damage exclusion using the “based upon, arising out of, or in any way related to” wording could also have the unintentional effect of precluding coverage for acts of terrorism that cause financial loss (e.g., terrorists destroy a manufacturing plant, causing loss of revenues and a consequent drop in a corporation's share price). This example provides yet another reason to avoid the “based upon, arising out of, or in any way related to” wording of the BI/PD exclusion, if possible. Chapter 9—Exclusions in D&O Policies 
63 
 Exception Wording When a D&O Po licy Covers Employment Practices 
When a D&O policy contains an employment practic es liability coverage endorsement, there should 
be “exception” wording within this exclusion, so that coverage will apply for li bel, slander, emotional 
distress, and other common personal injury per ils. Such an exception is  necessary because these types 
of allegations are often made in conjunction with employment-related claims of wrongful termination, 
discrimination, retaliation,  and sexual harassment. 
Exclusion of “Intentional Torts” and/or “Personal Injury” 
Similar to the exclusion of bodily injury or propert y damage discussed above, this exclusion relates to 
“personal injury” or “intentional torts.” At one time, D&O policies usually excluded only libel or 
slander, in this class of torts. But as more insure ds have acquired broad pers onal injury protection in 
their basic insurance portfolios, via commercial general liability (CGL) and employment practices 
liability (EPL) policies, this exclusion has usually been expande d because these other policies will 
respond to such claims. In many D&O policies, the “intentional torts” exclusion is attached to the 
“bodily injury and property damage liability” exclusion, as a clause of that exclusion rather than having a separate identity, adding  “invasion of privacy,” “wrongful entry,” “eviction,” “false arrest,” “false imprisonment,” “malicious prosecution,” “libel,” and “slander,” as excluded perils within the 
bodily injury/property damage exclusion. This excl usion should be removed if the policy is written 
with an EPLI coverage endorsement and the genera l D&O exclusions also apply to the endorsement, 
since the intention of the EPLI endorsement is to cover such claims. 
Pollution Exclusion 
Most pollution exclusions in D&O forms are highly restrictive and exclude coverage for all forms of 
pollution. (A recent decision by the 11th U.S. Ci rcuit Court of Appeals held that the pollution 
exclusion applied, and no coverage was available,  even though the insured did not cause the pollution 
giving rise to a claim.) In addition to property damage and bodily injury caused by pollution, the 
policies also preclude coverage for cleanup costs involving a pollution loss. It also eliminates 
coverage for penalties that might be levied agains t directors and officers. Such penalties could be 
applied when their decisions result in either a viol ation of federal, state, or other environmental 
protection statutes. Or, these penalties might be levied in a common law action based on something other than bodily injury or property damage, such  as tort actions alleging nuisance or trespass.  
“Based Upon, Arising Out of, Related to” Wording versus “For” Wording 
It should also be pointed out that, like the BI/PD exclusion (discussed above), a number insurers use 
language that excludes coverage “for” pollution, rather than excluding claims “based upon, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, or in consequence of” pollution. For the same reasons, 
“for” language is preferable for the insure d and should be included, where possible.

Chapter 9 Review Questions  
1. As with other insurance policies, exclusions in a D&O insurance contract commonly appear 
in all the following places, except:  
a. the application. 
b. the conditions. 
c. the definitions. 
d. the endorsement. 
2. Although Chopped Sewage Company’s D&O polic y excludes coverage for intentionally 
committed illegal acts, questions remained as to whether the acts of Sam, the officer accused 
of a wrongful act, were intentional. Because the D&O policy’s dishonesty exclusion contains 
final adjudication wording, which of the follo wing describes the earliest point at which the 
insurer can deny coverage for Sam based on the exclusion?  
a. A document produced during the discovery phase suggests Sam intended to commit 
fraud. 
b. An appeals court upholds the trial court’s finding that Sam intentionally committed a crime.  
c. At Sam’s trial, the plaintiff introduces evidence establishing the facts. 
d. The insurer’s investigation uncovers a witness to a conversation in which Sam described 
his plans to commit the fraudulent act. 
3. Missing Lynx Company’s D&O policy excludes c overage whenever “an insured” personally 
profits from the alleged wrongful conduct. From  the standpoint of an insured, the major 
problem with this wording is that: 
a. it conflicts with the severability provision and creates an ambiguity. 
b. it precludes coverage for all insureds, even those who are not culpable.  
c. the exclusion fails to clarify who is an insured. 
d. the party that profits from the alleged conduc t is the party that needs the coverage. 
4. Exceptions to the insured versus insured exclusion in a D&O policy normally provide 
coverage for all of the following situations, except:  
a. A bankruptcy trustee sues corporate directors and officers. 
b. A director seeks indemnification from anot her director for expenses resulting from a 
lawsuit against the first director. 
c. A former director, who left the board ten y ears ago but is still a major stockholder, sues 
current directors. 
d. A corporation sues its officers for making bad decisions.

 5. Noah Sark Ferry Corporation stock became worthless when passengers’ injury and death 
claims exceeded corporate assets after the ferry capsized during a storm. The ferry and vehicles aboard the ferry were also destroyed. Shareholders sued corporate president and boat 
captain Noah Sark for a wrongful act arising out of bad management, alleging that the boat 
should not have been sailing when a severe st orm was predicted. The corporation’s D&O 
policy precludes coverage for claims based upon, arising out of, or in any way related to 
bodily injury or property damage.”  In this case, the D&O claim: 
a. is covered because it alleges a wrongful act that is not related to bodily injury or property 
damage 
b. is covered because it is based on th e stockholders’ emotional distress. 
c. is not covered because it is related to the bodi ly injury to passengers and the property 
damage to their vehicles 
d. is not covered because devaluation of corpor ate stock is a form of property damage 
 
 
    
 
     
 
 
Answers to Chapter 9 Review Questions 
1. a. Exclusions and/or other options may be selected in an application, but they become effective when 
they appear as part of  the contract language. 
2. b. The earliest point at which the insurer can deny coverage for Sam based on the exclusion is when the final adjudication verdict establishes Sam’s intent as a legal fact. 
3. b. Courts have held that such wording precludes coverage for all insureds, not just the culpable one 
4. d. The D&O policy does not intend to protect a corporation against bad business decisions. 
5. c. The D&O claim is not covered because this s econdary claim is clearly related to the bodily

67 Chapter 10 
Coverage Triggers in D&O Policies 
Chapter 10 explains the nature of D&O policy covera ge triggers.  It begins by discussing how they 
function and also describes the key terms associat ed with claims-made coverage triggers (i.e., 
retroactive dates, discovery provisions,  and extended reporting provisions).  
Operation of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
Virtually all of the major insurers' policy forms are written on a claims-made basis. To be covered 
under a claims-made policy, a claim must be:  
1. first made  against an insured during the policy period,  
2. result from a wrongful act that took place on or after the policy's retroactive date ,  and be  
3. reported to the insurer , prior to the expiration of the policy (or within 30 to 60 days following 
expiration).   
The italicized terms will be explained in the pages that follow. 
Operation of a claims-made coverage trigger is illustrated in Exhibit 10.1 
 
   
 
     
 
  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
68 Exhibit 10.1 
How a Claims-Made Policy Functions 
Policy Period: 1/1/11–1/1/12 
Retro Date: 1/1/10 Wrongful Act: 7/1/10 Claim Made: 7/1/11 
 
 
 
In this example, coverage applies because: (1) the claim was first made against the insured 
during the 1/1/11–12 policy period, (2) the wrongf ul act took place after the policy’s 1/1/10 
retroactive date, and (3) the claim was reported to the insurer prior to policy expiration. Had the 
wrongful act taken place prior to the policy’s 1/1/10 retroactive date, coverage would not have 
applied. Similarly, there would have been no coverage, had the claim been made against the 
insured prior to 1/1/11 or after 1/1/12. 
The Significance of “First Made” Language 
Use of the term “first made” is significant because it indicates that coverage will apply only when the 
claim has not previously been made in conjunc tion with: (1) a policy prior in time written by the 
current insurer or (2) made under a policy written by a different insurer, covering the insured prior to 
the current insurer.  
Claims-Made and Reported Policies 
Under a minority of D&O policies, coverage applies only if the claim is both first made against the 
insured and reported to the insurer during the pol icy period. This is known as a “claims-made and 
reported” policy. For example, under such a policy with a 1/1/10–11 term, no coverage would apply 
unless a claim was both made against the insured du ring the policy period and also reported to the 
insurer prior to 1/1/11.     
Claims-Made Policies and Reported Policies with Post-Policy Reporting “Windows” 
In contrast, a majority of forms provide what are known as post-policy claim reporting “windows,” 
under which claims made against the insured during the policy period can be reported to the insurer 
for either 30 or 60 days (depending upon the insurer) after expiration of the policy.  
D&O forms containing post-policy reporting “window s” are preferable to claims-made and reported 
policies. This is because some circumstances coul d render it impossible for an insured to report a 
claim made late in a policy period. For example, if  a summons is delivered to an insured CEO’s office 
late in the day that a policy expires, the insured may be unable to notify the insurer within the policy 
period.  This case may be especially true if he or she is not in the office that day or if the summons 
were served late in the day at the start of a long,  holiday weekend, as a resu lt of which the insurer’s 
office had closed earlier than usual.  Under such ci rcumstances, a claims-made policy that contains a Chapter 10—Coverage Tri ggers in D&O Policies 
69 
 30-day or, preferably for the insured, a 60-day post-policy reporting window is advantageous 
compared to a claims-made and reported policy because it allows an insured to report a claim to the insurer after the term of coverage has expired. 
Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates in D&O liability policies state that  for coverage to apply, the wrongful act giving 
rise to a claim must have taken place on or after th e retroactive date. Thus, retroactive dates preclude 
coverage for claims stemming from acts that t ook place prior to a policy's retroactive date. 
Purposes of Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates have the effect of excluding coverage for possible wrongful acts committed in 
conjunction with some known event (i.e., known to the insured) that took place prior to policy inception. They also preclude coverage for wrongful acts that transpired in the distant past—even if 
unknown to the insured. 
Retroactive dates are generally included in D&O liability policies for organizations that are buying 
coverage for the first time. This is because underwriters are reluctant to offer “full prior acts coverage” (i.e., policies without retroactive dates) unde r such circumstances. Th eir concern is that the 
insured's sudden desire to obtain a policy may have been prompted by the need to obtain coverage for 
circumstances they suspect could produce a claim in the future. For example, if a lawyer began 
practicing on 1/1/00 but  did not seek to buy professional lia bility coverage until 1/1/10, an 
underwriter could have the impression that the lawyer expects a claim to be made against him shortly, since he practiced for 10 years without purchasing professional liability coverage.   
 “Full Prior Acts”: Coverage without a Retroactive Date 
However, for a firm that already has a D&O polic y in place with another insurer, inclusion of a 
retroactive date should be resisted unless there is  a specific underwriting reason, such as a complete 
change in the company's operating management and boa rd of directors. By eliminating a retroactive 
date, a policy will provide what is known as “full prio r acts coverage” for all acts, going back to when 
the organization was founded/incepted. 
Retro Date Should Be No Earlier than the Insured’s First D&O Policy Inception 
Ideally, an insured will have a policy written with full prior acts (i.e., no retroactive date) coverage. But at very least, an insured should always require an  insurer to offer a policy with a retroactive date 
that coincides with the date on which it first began buying D&O coverage (known as “prior acts” 
coverage) , even if that date precedes the date  on which its current insurer first began writing 
coverage. If an insured’s retroactive date does not  coincide with the date on which it first began 
buying coverage, a coverage gap will result since there will be no coverage for wrongful acts that 
took place between the inception date of the insured’s first D&O policy ever purchased and the retroactive date of the new insurer’s policy.  
Always Resist Retroactive Date Ad vancements When Replacing Coverage 
At times, underwriters seek an “advanced” retroac tive date when writing coverage for a new account. 
This has the effect of limiting the coverage they are willing to provide, to the start of the period of time this new insurer will be on the account. This approach is detrimental for an insured because it provides no coverage for acts that took place from the inception date of its first policy and the 
inception date of the new insurer’s policy. Accordingly, D&O insureds and their agents/brokers Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
70 should always resist such advancements, even if additional premium is required to achieve “prior 
acts” coverage.  
Options Backdating Claims Illustrate the Importance of Retroactive Dates 
The wave of option backdating claims that surfaced in the summer of 2006 illustrate the potential 
problems that can result from retroactive dates in D&O policies. (Option backdating occurs when a 
stock option exercise date is set prior to the da te on which the option was granted and at a lower 
exercise price than the current market price of the company’s stock. Directors and officers are 
frequently compensated by means of option grants, in addition to salary.) Option backdating is not 
illegal, provided the backdating is clearly communicat ed to stockholders and as long as the effect of 
the backdating is properly reflected  in both earnings reports and in tax payments. However, in recent 
years, there have been a number of lawsuits agai nst corporate directors and officers alleging illegal 
option backdating in which these conditions were not met.  
Many of these claims related to option grants that were made during the mid-to-late 1990s, in some 
cases as many as 10 years earlier. So unless the retroa ctive date on an insure d corporation's current 
D&O policy form—the one under which an options backdating claim was being made—is earlier in 
time than the alleged wrongful acts associated w ith these options grants, no coverage will be 
available. 
For example, assume that improper options grants (i.e., the “wrongful acts”) were alleged to have 
been made in 1997. Unless the insured's current D&O policy contains a retroactive date of 1/1/97 (or 
earlier), no coverage would apply, despite the fact that the claim was made against the insured during 
the term of the policy presently in force. As these circumstances illustrate, retroactive dates present potential coverage problems because D&O 
claims have a way of “popping up” despite the fact  that the alleged wrongful conduct giving rise to 
the claim took place many years earlier, as was the case with these optio n backdating claims. 
Retroactive Date Issues in Policies for IPOs 
One error is often made when structuring D& O coverage for companies making initial public 
offerings (IPOs) of its shares of stock to the pu blic. Specifically, policies for such companies are 
sometimes written with a retroactive date coinciding with the date on which the company first began 
selling shares to the public. This is normally the date on which such firms are considered “public companies.” There are two coverage gaps created under this scenario.  
No Coverage for Operations Prior to the IPO 
First, by setting the retro date as the date on whic h the company begins selling shares to the public, it 
eliminates coverage for any claims that resulted from acts committed prior to that time. Few 
companies begin as publicly-traded firms. More typica lly, they first achieve success as privately-held 
companies and then, some years later, begin selling shares to the public, most often, given the firm’s 
need to raise capital so it can expand its already-successful operations.  
No Coverage for Prospectus-Related Claims 
Second, by setting a retroactive date coincident w ith the date on which it begins selling shares to the 
public, it will eliminate coverage for claims relating to the firm’s prospectus. (A prospectus provides 
details about the company’s history and operations, includes detailed financial da ta, and is intended to 
serve as an inducement for people to buy shares of stock in the company.) This is because an IPO Chapter 10—Coverage Tri ggers in D&O Policies 
71 
 offering prospectus is always prepared prior to  the date on which shares are offered. Thus, any 
alleged wrongful act associated with the prospectus (i.e., allegations by investors that the prospectus 
misrepresented the company’s financial condition) , would have necessarily taken place prior to the 
retro date and, as a result, would not be covered. Ad mittedly, a retro date coincident with the date on 
which the firm went public will produce a lower premium compared, for example, to one coinciding 
with its inception. However, given the relatively hi gh risk associated with IPOs, any premium savings 
achieved in this manner are probably not worth it. 
Accordingly, if a company begins offering shares to the public, and as a result, seeks to buy D&O 
coverage for the first time, the policy’s retroactiv e date should coincide with the date on which the 
firm initially “opened its doors,” even if this was a number of years prior to becoming or beginning the process of becoming a public corporation.  
Discovery Provisions 
Circumstances often arise under which it is probable that an act, error, or omission will eventually 
cause a claim to be made against insured directors/ officers—despite the fact that litigation may not be 
initiated for some time. Accordingly, virtually all D&O policies provide, by means of what are called 
“discovery provisions” (also known as “incident re porting provisions” or “notice of potential claim 
provisions”), that if the insured advises the insure r of “incidents” or “potential claims” during the 
policy, any claims arising out of such “incidents” will be considered to have been “made” during that 
policy period. For example, a corporation announces th at it did not meet its quarterly earnings target 
and as a result, receives negative commentary in the financial press. During the next week, the company’s share price drops by 20 percent. This chai n of events could be considered an “incident,” 
reportable under a D&O policy’s discovery provision. While no claims have yet been received, there 
is a strong possibility that sharehol der class action lawsuits, will follow. 
When such notice is provided to the insurer, coverage for these claims will apply regardless of how long after the policy under which they were re ported has expired. Exhibit 10.2 illustrates the 
operation of a discovery provision.  
Exhibit 10.2 
How a Discovery Provision Functions 
 
 
 
In this example, coverage applies because the insu rer was notified by the insured of an “incident” 
on 8/1/10. Although the claim associated with the incident was not made against the insured until 
after the 1/1/10–11 policy had expired, coverage applies nonetheless because the insurer was 
notified of the incident under t he policy’s discovery provision. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
72 Extended Reporting Provisions 
Extended reporting periods (ERPs), which are also known as extended discovery or “tail” provisions 
and are included in D&O policies, give an insure d the right to present claims after a policy has 
expired or been canceled. Exhibit 10.3 illustrates how an ERP provision functions. 
 
Exhibit 10.3 
How an Extended Reporting Period Functions 
Insurer A’s Policy Term: 1/1/11-12  
Insured buys an ERP from Insurer A, with a term of 1/1/12-13 
Wrongful Act: 7/1/11 Claim Made and Reported: 7/1/12  
 
 
 
Coverage applies under the ERP because the wrongful act took place during Insurer A’s 
1/1/11–12 policy term and a claim associated with the act was made and reported during the 
term of Insurer A’s 1/1/12–13 ERP. One final, key point regarding ERPs: no coverage would 
have applied in this example if both the wrongful act took place and the claim were reported 
during the 1/1/12–13 ERP period. Rather, the wrongful act must take place during the expired\cancelled policy period for coverage to apply during the ERP. 
ERPs Do Not Reinstate Remaining Policy Limits 
ERPs do not, however, increase or reinstate the policy's limit of liability. Thus, coverage during an 
extended reporting period is always subject to available remaining limits. In some instances, especially where one or more significant claims are pe nding under an expiring po licy, insurers will, at 
times, make additional limits available under an ERP provision. However, reinstatement of this type 
will almost always require substantial additional premium, over and above the scale provided for in 
the policy, and as discussed below. 
No Coverage for Wrongful Acts during the ERP  
Nor do ERPs cover claims from wrongful acts that took place during the ERP. In effect, they only extend the time period during which wrongful acts that took place during the expired (or in some instances, canceled policy), can be reported to the insurer. Rather, for coverage to apply under an 
extended reporting period, the alle ged wrongful act giving rise to the claim must have taken place on 
or after the retroactive date, if any, of the policy and before the policy's term ination date. Thus, ERPs 
do not afford coverage for an act or omission that took place during the extended reporting period itself, in spite of the fact that such a clai m is reported during the extended reporting period. 
Discovery Provisi ons versus ERPs 
Although these two provisions are often confused, the difference is straightforward. Discovery 
provisions allow insureds to obtain coverage for in cidents that are reported during the policy period. 
In contrast, ERPs provide coverage for claims that are reported after a policy period has expired. Chapter 10—Coverage Tri ggers in D&O Policies 
73 
 Key Variations between ERP Provisions 
There are several important variations between the key provisions associated with ERPs as they are 
written by the different D&O insurers. These differen ces are described in the following paragraphs.  
Availability 
The vast majority of D&O forms permit the insured to purchase an ERP if cancellation/nonrenewal is 
at the insured's or the insurer’s election. This is known as a two-way or bilateral tail. A few provide 
this option only in the event that cancellation/nonrenew al is initiated by the insurer, termed a one-way 
tail. Clearly, D&O policy forms that contain bilateral ERPs are preferable to those offering only a 
one-way tail provision. The latter should be vigorous ly resisted when negotiating coverage with an 
insurer. 
Coverage for “Notice of Circumstances” during ERP 
A key variation between the ERPs in D&O forms is whether a report of circumstances that have the potential—but have not yet resulted in a formal clai m against the insured—are covered by an ERP. In 
effect, under some insurers' ERP wording, the polic y's discovery provision (discussed earlier in this 
section) is operative, whereas in others, it is not.  
Case in point: A D&O policy expires on January 1, 2010, at which time the insured firm buys a 1-
year ERP. On August 1, 2010, the insured firm b ecomes aware of circumstan ces (from a wrongful act 
that took place during the expired policy) that could potentially materialize into a formal claim, but 
have not yet. Under some insurers' policies, the report of such circumstances would trigger coverage. 
However, under other insurers' ERP wording, no coverage would apply until the insured has a formal claim made against it, even if these circumstan ces are reported to the insurer during the ERP. 
Given the situation in the above scenario, the insure d would be compelled to purchase (if available) 
another ERP at the expiration of the current ERP, if  the potential claim had not yet been made against 
the firm, but was expected at some point. In th is situation, the advantage of having a policy's 
discovery provision that is operative during the ERP provision, is apparent. 
Duration 
In most instances, D&O insurers offer ERPs of 1 year in duration, although in some cases, ERP durations of longer durations are offered, as well. Multiple duration options (e.g. 1 year, 2 years, 3 
years) are often available under D&O policies written for privately held and nonprofit organizations. 
However, publicly traded companies are rarely a llowed anything other than a 1-year option.  
Premium Charge 
In nearly all instances, the polici es state the premium charge for th e ERP option. This is typically 
done by indicating that the ERP will cost a fixed percentage of the expiring policy's premium; 
normally 100 to 200 percent, depending upon the individual policy, for a 1-year ERP.  
Time in Which To Elect 
The majority of D&O policies allow the insured up to 30 days following nonrenewal, expiration, or 
cancellation to purchase the ERP. A few allow as long  as 60 days in which to make this election, 
which is, of course, preferable since it is benefici al to maximize the time period in which the insured 
can make this election. Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
74 Runoff Policies 
As an alternative to an ERP, there are certain  circumstances under which insureds should consider 
purchasing a runoff policy. 
Runoff Policies versus ERPs 
Like ERPs, runoff policies also permit an insured to report claims (that resulted from wrongful acts 
taking place during prior policy periods) for a specified period of time in the future. In contrast, the 
use of runoff policies is typically restricted to s ituations in which an insured merges with or is 
acquired by another organization, rather than when the insured replaces coverage with another 
insurer, as is usually the case when an ERP is purchased. Like ERPs, runoff policies are usually 
offered on a 1-year basis. However, unlike, ERPs, th ey are usually offered on a renewable basis, with 
a decreasing premium for each subsequent 1-year renewal period.

following criteria, except:  
a. first made against an insured during the policy period. 
b. result from a wrongful act during the policy period. 
c. be reported to the insurer prior to the policy’s expiration (or within 30 to 60 days following expiration. 
d. result from a wrongful act on or after the retroactive date. 
2. Under a D&O policy with a post-policy reporting window, a claim first reported to the 
insurer after the policy period ends:  
a. is covered if it is reported while a 30- or  60-day post-policy reporting window is open. 
b. is covered if it is reported while a 30- or 60-day post-policy reporting window is closed.  
c. is covered if the wrongful act takes place within a 30 or 60 days of the policy period. 
d. is never covered. 
3. The provisions in a D&O policy that give the insured a right to present claims after a policy 
has terminated are referred to in several  ways. These include all of the following, except:  
a. extended discovery provisions. 
b. extended reporting periods.  
c. nose coverage.

Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1. b. The alleged wrongful act need not take place duri ng the policy period so long as other criteria are 
met. 
2. a. Claims made against the insured during the policy pe riod can be reported to the insurer for either 30 
or 60 days (depending upon the insurer) after expiration of the policy.

Excess D&O Insurance Policies 
Chapter 11 explains the nature and function of excess D&O policies. 
Excess D&O policies are used in situ ations when an insured requires higher limits than any single 
D&O insurer may be willing to provide. In such situations, insureds obtain a primary D&O policy 
and then proceed to build excess “layers” of cove rage above the primary policy, until a sufficient 
limit has been obtained. A layered D&O pr ogram is illustrated in Exhibit 11.1.  
 
Exhibit 11.1 
A Layered D&O Program 
Layer    Insurer 
$10 million primary policy A 
$25 million 1st excess layer ($25 million excess of $10 million) B 
$25 million 2nd excess layer ($25 million excess of $35 million) C 
$25 million 3rd excess layer ($25 million excess of $60 million) D $15 million 4th excess layer ($15 million excess of $85 million) E 
Total Limits: $100 million 
 
Quota Share Excess D&O Programs  
Quota share arrangements among excess D&O insurers are being used more frequently now than in 
the past few years. Unlike the example provided in Exhibit 11.1 above (where only one insurer 
provided all of the coverage within each excess layer), the quota share approach involves the 
assumption of a given layer of excess coverage by more than one insurer. Under such arrangements, participating insurers provide policies that afford a specific percentage of coverage within a particular 
layer. Exhibit 11.2 illustrates a quota share D&O program. 
  
 Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
78 Exhibit 11.2 
Enron’s Quota Share D&O Program 
 
 
 
 Chapter 11—Excess D&O Insurance Policies 
79 
 Exhibit 11.2 provides an example of a quota share excess D&O program. Specifically, it depicts 
Enron's D&O program that provided a total of $350 million of coverage at th e time of its financial 
collapse in late 2001. Note that the $50 million la yer of coverage, excess of $300 million, is afforded 
under a quota share arrangement, in which five di fferent insurers are participating, in various 
percentages, to provide a total of $50 million of  coverage. If, for exampl e, there was a $25 million 
loss within this $50 million layer, each of the fi ve insurers would contribute their respective 
percentages, as noted in Exhibit 11.2. So, for ex ample, since Federal provided 50 percent of the 
coverage within this layer, in the event of a $25 million loss, it would pay 50 percent, or $12,500,000.   
Coverage under Excess D&O Policies: Two Basic Types 
There are two basic types of excess D&O insurance policies. 
• Follow form policies  
• Independent or “stand-alone” excess policies  
Follow form policies are much more common and, in  recent years, “stand-alone” excess policies have 
generally not been available.  
Follow Form Excess D&O Policies 
These policies adopt the coverage provisions of the underlying policy or policies. This usually includes such matters as insuring agreements, c onditions, exclusions, and other key coverage 
provisions. The insuring agreements state that unless endorsed, the coverage provided by the excess 
D&O policy will not be broader than that afforded by the form immediately below it in the “tower” of 
coverage.  
Independent or “Stand-Alone” D&O Policies  
These excess policies have their own complete set s of coverage agreem ents, definitions, and 
exclusions. However, as already no ted, since the late 1990s, such policies are rarely written. Rather, 
following form excess policies are by far more common.   
Underlying Limits of Liability Definition 
The manner in which an excess D&O policy defines “underlying limits of liability” is important in 
understanding how excess D&O policies function. Typically, the “underl ying limits of liability” is 
defined as the sum of (1) the primary D&O policy limits, (2) any retention applicable under the primary D&O policy, and (3) all limits available under any underlying excess policies.  
Applying the Underlying Limits  of Liability Definition 
Assume an insured has a primary D&O policy with a $5 million limit. The policy is written with a $1 
million retention. The insured also has a firs t excess policy with a $10 million limit and a second 
excess policy with a $10 million limit. In this situation: 
• $6 million is the “underlying limit” as respects the first excess policy ($5 million primary policy + $1 million primary retention), and  
• $16 million is the “underlying limit” as respects the second excess policy ($5 million primary limit + $1 million primary retention + $10 million first excess limit).  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
80 Limit of Liability Provision 
The manner in which D&O excess policies define the term “limit of liability” is also important in the 
functioning of excess D&O policies.  
This provision states that the excess D&O insurer will pay losses that exceed the “underlying limit of 
liability.” This means that the excess insurer is not  liable until each of the underlying insurers have 
paid the full amount of the “underlying limits of liability” (as defined in their policies). Finally, the 
provision indicates that if underlying limits are reduced or exhausted, the policy will pay excess of 
these reduced or exhausted limits, but only after th e retention applicable to the primary policy has 
been satisfied. 
Applying the Limit of Liability Provision 
Referring to the example used in the underlying limit section (above), the limit of liability provision 
indicates that: 
• the second excess D&O insurer must pay loss ex cess of the underlying limit, which in this 
case is $16 million ($5 million primary limit + $1 million primary retention + $10 million 
first excess limit) up to a maximum of an additional $10 million (the policy limit of the second excess D&O policy); however,  
• no payment must be made by the second excess D&O insurer until the “underlying limit” of 
$16 million has been satisfied by payments from both the primary insurer and first excess 
insurer ($15 million) plus absorption of the $1 million retention by the insured under the 
primary policy.  
Exhaustion/Depletion of Underlying Limits Provision 
All excess D&O policies contain a provision stati ng that the underlying policies must be exhausted 
before the excess insurer has any lia bility for payment of loss.   
There are four rationales underlying this type of provision. 
1. To assure that the excess insurer is not being requested to drop down to assume loss that it 
did not bargain to accept.  
2. To be sure that the professional claims department and/or counsel of the primary insurer has evaluated the claim, analyzing such issues as coverage, allocation, a nd the application of 
exclusions. (Although these findings may not be binding on the excess insurer, excess insurers generally rely on the work done by the primary insurer.)  
3. To be certain that its place in the queues of insu rers is not violated, an insurer will not forced 
to pay a loss when there is an insurer having a greater obligation to pay the loss still available 
to the insureds.  
4. In the case of “duty to defend” policies, to a void a premature demand for defense of a claim. 
(However, this is not applicable to most D& O claim situations, since the majority of D&O 
policies written with excess coverage do not involve a duty to defend.)  
Strict versus Liberal Exhaustion of  Limits Provisions: A Case Study 
Excess insurers use different policy language to de fine “exhaustion”—some of which is worse for the 
insured than others.  Chapter 11—Excess D&O Insurance Policies 
81 
 Facts of the Case 
In Qualcomm, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London , 161 Cal. App. 4th 184, 73 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 770 (Ct. App. 4th Dist. 2008), employees sued Qualcomm over issues related to their stock 
options.  Qualcomm settled the stock option litiga tion, incurring $28.6 million in defense and 
indemnity costs. 
Qualcomm had a $20 million primary D&O policy with AIG and an excess D&O policy with 
Lloyd’s.  Qualcomm settled its coverage claim under the AIG policy for $16 million. This was the most AIG agreed to pay as respects the claim. Si nce Qualcomm was willing to absorb the next $4 
million in costs between the $16 million AIG settlement and the $20 million attachment point of the excess coverage, it only sought excess coverage fo r about $8.6 million from Lloyd’s. (Note: 
according to what Qualcomm  thought  were the terms of the Lloyd’s excess policy, that policy would 
not afford coverage until $20 million had been paid out within the primary layer—whether by the primary insurer and/or by Qualcomm. In effect , Qualcomm needed to self-insure the $4 million 
settlement “gap” so it could access the Lloyd’s excess policy.) 
 Unfortunately for Qualcomm, the Lloyd’s excess polic y had a very strict exhaustion provision that 
read “Underwriters shall be liable only after the insurers under each of the Underlying Policies [the AIG policy, in this instance] have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of the Underlying Limit of Liability.” 
The Court’s Ruling 
The appellate court held that Qualcomm was not entitled to excess coverage.  Nothing in the Lloyd’s exhaustion provision was ambiguous.  It clearly required either that (1) AIG “has paid” the full 
amount of the $20 million primary limit, or (2) that AIG has been “held liable to pay” the full amount 
of the $20 million underlying limit.  Neither of those events occurred.  AIG actually paid only $16 million out of its $20 million underlying limit.  AIG was not “held liable” by a judge or jury.  Even reading the phrase “held liable to pay” as meaning be ing obligated to pay under a settlement, in this 
case, the settlement only required AIG to pay $16 million out of the $20 million underlying limit.  Since the terms of the strict exhaustion provision were not fulfilled, the court held that Qualcomm 
forfeited around $8.6 million in excess coverage. 
The real problem in the Qualcomm case was that th e exhaustion provision restricted who was allowed 
to pay the underlying limit.  The plain terms of the Lloyd’s policy said only the underlying insurer  
was allowed to pay.  This language simply did not grant the insured a contractual right to absorb any 
portion of the settlement costs within the primary layer. 
A Better Alternative 
There are other, more liberal, versions of policy language regarding exhaus tion of primary coverage 
that would have better suited the insured in th e Qualcomm case. Specifically, some excess D&O 
policies expressly permit the insured to pay a portion of the underlying limit.  For example, ACE Bermuda‘s excess D&O policy contains an exhaustion provision condition that reads: “liability for any covered Loss with respect to Claims first made  in each Policy Year shall attach to the Insurer 
only after [1] the insurers of the Underlying Policies, [2] the Insured Company  and/or [3] the Insured 
Persons shall have paid, in the a pplicable legal currency, the full amount of the Underlying Limit for 
such Policy Year.” Under this language, the “Insur ed Company” has the right to contribute payment 
toward the underlying limit, which the excess insure r will deem to be satisfied as long as the full 
amount is paid by any combination of the three listed parties.   Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
82 The Lesson of the Case 
If the language specifies that only the primary insurer can pay the underlying limit, it is wise to 
negotiate a more liberal exhaustion provision givi ng the insured the contractual right to absorb a 
portion of settlement costs without forfeiting excess coverage.   
Maintenance of Underlying Policies Provision 
Of utmost importance to an excess insurer are (1) the existence of the underlying insurance and (2) 
the solvency of the underlying insu rers. The purpose of this provision is to protect the excess insurer 
in the event that any of the underlying insurers' po licies expire or are canceled yet not replaced with 
comparable coverage. In such instances, and in  the absence of the maintenance of underlying 
insurance provision, an affected excess insure r would otherwise be liable for loss that these 
underlying policies would no longer cover. Howe ver, since the excess insurer's premium was 
predicated on the existence of a specific amount of underlying coverage, it would be inequitable for 
the excess insurer to bear such loss.  
For example, let us return to the numbers used in the previous example (beginning under the heading 
of “Applying the Underlying Limits of Liability Definition”): 
• an insured has a primary D&O policy with a $5 million limit. The policy is written with a $1 million retention. The insured also has a first excess policy with a $10 
million limit and a second excess policy with a $10 million limit. In this situation: 
o $6 million is the “underlying limit” as respects the first excess policy ($5 million primary policy + $1 million primary retention), and  
o $16 million is the “underlying limit” as respects the second excess policy ($5 million primary limit + $1 million primary retention + $10 million first excess limit).  
If the first excess insurer were to cancel coverage and the insured were unable to secure replacement 
coverage, the second excess insurer would not be lia ble for any payments until the primary insurer 
paid $5 million of loss, the insured absorbed the $1 million retention applicable under the primary 
policy, and the insured self-insured the $10 milli on policy limit of the first excess insurer whose 
coverage was not replaced. In effect, based on the ma intenance of underlying insurance provision, the 
second excess insurer would not be liable until a total of  $16 million had been paid or absorbed by the 
insured and the primary insurer. 
Two Versions of the Maintenance of Underlying Policies Provision 
There are two versions of the maintenance of underlying insurance provision.  
Restrictive Version 
Under the restrictive version, if an underlying polic y is canceled or its limits are otherwise impaired 
(e.g., by means of insurer insolvency), the excess policy above it automatically terminates. In the example being discussed above, assume the primar y insurer writing the $5 million of coverage 
becomes insolvent and is no longer able to pay claims. The first excess policy above it provides an 
additional $10 million limit, but the form contains a restrictive version of the maintenance of underlying limits provision. In this situation,  the $10 million excess po licy would automatically 
terminate and the insured would have neither pr imary coverage nor the coverage under the first 
excess policy available. Chapter 11—Excess D&O Insurance Policies 
83 
 Favorable Version 
In contrast, under the favorable version of th e maintenance of underlying provision found within 
excess D&O policy forms, if an underlying policy is can celed or its limits become impaired (in this 
instance, by the primary insurer's insolvency),  the excess policy above it will not automatically 
terminate. Rather, the excess policy applies as if th e policyholder were self-insured for the underlying 
layer (i.e., the excess policy will not “drop down”). In  the previous claim example, if the primary 
insurer became insolvent, the first excess insurer's policy would remain in force, subject to a $6 
million self-insured retention ($5 million policy limit + $1 million retention).   
Implications of the Maintenance of Underlying Insurance Provision 
Given the significant functional difference between the favorable and restrictive versions of the 
maintenance of underlying provisions, it is a cr itical point of differentiation between excess D&O 
policies. Accordingly, when putting together an excess D&O program, the restrictive version of the 
maintenance of underlying limits provision should be  avoided. If it cannot, such policy(ies) should be 
placed as high as possible in the insured's “tower of coverage.” 
A follow form excess policy adopts the exclus ions in the immediately underlying policy. 
Accordingly, in the example that has been used  throughout this section on excess D&O policies, the 
second excess D&O policy would adopt any addition al exclusions found in the first excess D&O 
policy and the first excess policy would adopt any additional exclusions found in the primary policy.  If an excess D&O policy contains additional exclusions , this would be to the insured's disadvantage. 
Accordingly, such policies should be avoided wh enever possible. If, however, this cannot be 
arranged, such policies should be placed on the to p layer of an excess D&O program to minimize the 
probability of involving that policy in a claim s ituation. Otherwise, these added exclusions would 
probably be adopted automatically by insurers  providing higher layers of excess coverage.  
Warranty Clause 
Some excess D&O policies contain a warranty clau se to either supplement the one found in the 
application or, in some cases, to function as the wa rranty for the policy when none is contained in the 
application. Warranty provisions are fairly standard except that some contain a grant of severability, 
which, of course, is favorable for the insured.    
Integrated Excess Policies 
In addition to excess D&O policies, which apply to a single type of coverage, a number of insurers 
offer what are known as “integrated” or “flexibl e” excess policies that apply as excess coverage over 
a variety of claims-made policies. These policies include directors and officers (D&O) liability, 
employment practices liability, and fiduciary liability. 
Integrated excess policies are written with a single aggregate policy limit for all coverages combined. 
The terms and conditions of such forms are gene rally similar to those found in excess D&O forms, 
except for those changes required to accommodate multiple coverages. Under integrated excess policies, if losses other than D&O losses exhaust the aggregate policy limit, 
there will be no coverage left for D&O claims other than what is available in underlying policies. On 
the other hand, for the same amount of total premium dollars as might be paid for individual excess 
policies, a much higher aggregate limit for the entire group of coverages will probably be available under an integrated excess policy.  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
84 The question then becomes whether it is better to have a rigid wall around the D&O policy to protect 
only the directors and officers or to have the flexibility to apply the excess coverage where it is 
needed when other types of losses (i.e., employment practices, fiduciary, crime) occur. The manner in 
which integrated excess policies functi on is illustrated by Exhibit 11.3. 
 
Exhibit 11.3 
Operation of an Integrated Excess Policy 
 
 
In this diagram, an aggregate limit of $25 million in coverage is provided under the integrated excess 
policy. The policy functions exactly like an um brella policy, providing $25 million in excess 
coverage over the three underlying policies—in any combination—whenever any of the limits, of any 
of the underlying policies, are exhausted.  
Two Examples 
In Option 1 shown on the left, the insured has allo cated $20 million of the ex cess coverage to apply 
over the EPL policy to cover a very large EPL claim, which leaves only $5 million of the aggregate limit available which can be applied over the other policies, such as the D&O policy. In Option 2 
shown on the right, the insured has allocated $10 m illion of the excess coverage to the EPL policy, $5 
million of the excess coverage to the D&O policy, and $10 million of the excess coverage to the fiduciary liability policy. Chapter 11—Excess D&O Insurance Policies 
85 
 In a like manner, the insured has the flexibility to use the $25 million aggregate limit in any fashion to 
respond to large claims filed under any of the three underlying policies.

87 Chapter 12 
D&O Insurance for Privately-Held Companies 
Chapter 12 examines the unique nature of the D&O claim exposures to which privately-held 
companies are subject, as well as the distinct policy fo rms that are available to cover these exposures.  
Private Companies Do Have an Exposure to Securities Claims 
One of the most pervasive myths surrounding D&O insurance is that privately held firms have no 
need for the coverage because they  have no exposure to securities claims. As will be explained below, 
such firms do, in fact, have a securities claim exposure because they all have shareholders (despite the fact the corporation’s shares are not traded on a publ ic stock exchange).  In addition, privately held 
companies are frequently sued by competitors, gove rnment agencies, regulators, and employees—in 
addition to stockholders.  
Admittedly, private companies do not have securities exposures approaching the magnitude of 
publicly traded firms. Nevertheless, simply becau se a corporation is not publicly traded does not 
mean it has not issued a “security” that would subject it to U.S. securities laws. As a result, directors and officers of privately held corporations still ha ve an exposure to claims involving securities that it 
has issued, albeit a smaller one compared to publicly -traded firms. This smaller exposure is the result 
of three factors. 
• Privately-held corporations are not as large as publicly held ones . On average, the value 
of the outstanding stock of the typical privatel y-held company is smaller than that of the 
average publicly held firm. As a consequence, the size of the potential loss to shareholders is 
much smaller, a factor that signifi cantly reduces possible claim severity.  
• Privately-held corporations have fewer shareholders than publicly held ones . As a result, 
there are fewer plaintiffs that could potentia lly bring securities lawsu its against the typical 
privately-held corporation. This factor reduces potential securities claim frequency.  
• Privately-held corporations usually have highly concentrated ownership . Given such 
concentration, coupled with the fact that many D&O policies covering privately held firms preclude coverage for claims brought by sh areholders owning greater than a certain 
percentage of the corporation's stock (typica lly 10 percent), securities claim frequency is 
much lower for privately held companies compared  to publicly held companies. In fact, the 
typical privately held company does not have a single shareholder whose holdings are less than 10 percent.  Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
88 Unique Exposures Associated with Privately-Held Companies 
Although the legal duties of the directors and officer s of privately held organizations are similar to 
those of their publicly held counterparts, the pr ivately held sector's directors and officers often 
encounter special exposures that the directors and officers of publicly held companies do not face.  
Exposure as Advisers to Management 
First, outside directors are more likely to become personal advisers to senior management of privately 
held companies since those companies generally do not have extensive depth in their levels of 
management. 
Exposure from Domination by a Small Group of Shareholders 
Second, an outside director's liability exposure is heightened when the corporation is dominated by 
one or a small group of contro lling shareholders. These dominant shareholders are more likely to 
operate the organization without full regard to the rights and interests of minority shareholders and 
other company constituents. In such an instance, the outside director must be particularly mindful of the duty to represent all shareholders, not just the fac tion that elected that director to office, and must 
be prepared to oppose the wishes of the dominant shareholders when appropriate. 
Exposure from Limited Time  Commitment by Directors 
Third, as with the directors of nonprofit organizations, the directors of privately held companies will 
often serve on the board in a limited, part-tim e capacity with relatively small compensation. 
Similarly, the resources of these corporations may be insufficient to provide the directors with 
effective support. Thus, the directors may not have  access to all relevant information before making 
decisions. 
Potential Claimants 
The directors and officers of privately held firms face exposure to claims from a number of parties, including minority shareholders, employees, and a variety of third parties. 
Minority Shareholders as  Potential Claimants 
As already noted, many directors and officers of priv ately held corporations take false comfort in the 
fact that the corporation is not publicly traded and generally has fewer shareholders than larger 
publicly traded corporations. However, liability exposure to shareholders of privately held 
corporations does exist.  
In particular, minority shareholders frequently  assert D&O claims alleging that the business was 
conducted for the benefit of the controlling shareholde rs to the detriment of the minority shareholders. 
And even in a situation where the shareholde rs are viewed as colleagues or friendly business 
associates, the potential for shareholder liability exis ts. Events such as divorce, death, foreclosure on 
a stock pledge, or the insolvency of one of the shareholders may suddenly and dramatically thrust 
new shareholders with new perspectives  and expectations into the picture. 
Claims by Employees 
Employees are frequent claimants in lawsuits agains t privately held firms and their directors and 
officers. For this reason, nearly all writers of such  policies offer policies that are designed to provide 
broad EPL coverage, thereby precl uding the need to purchase a stand-alone EPL policy.  Chapter 12—D&O Insurance for Privately-Held Companies 
89 
 Claims by Third Parties 
Additionally, third-party claims brought by “outsiders” against directors and officers of privately held 
corporations have been increasing in frequency and severity in recent years. Examples of claims by third parties against directors and officers of privately held corporations include the following. 
• A company's directors and officers were held liable for damages when a competitor alleged that the firm's buyout discussions were merely a pretext to obtain information about the competitor.  
• The president of a construction company was held liable for negligence in the construction of a building because he was at the construction site  on a daily basis, supervised the construction 
process, and failed to act with reasonable care.  
• A company's directors and officers were sued for misappropriation of trade secrets when they 
hired a seasoned employee away from a competitor firm in the same industry.  
• A corporate president was held liable to the lessee of adjoining premises damaged by demolition of a building owned by his corporation, where he gave the contractor no instructions concerning the demolition.  This occurred despite his knowledge that if the 
demolition was improperly performed, it would damage the adjoining property.  
• A corporate president was held liable for breach of contract, where his corporation refused to 
deliver goods to a consumer and sold the goods  to another party at the direction of the 
president.  
• The president and vice president of a corporate waste disposal service were held liable for the 
corporation's illegal dumping and storage activities.  
Distinctive Aspects of Private Company D&O Coverage Forms 
For the most part, the policies written to cover priv ately held companies are very similar to those 
available to publicly traded organizations. Howeve r, there are several key differences between the 
two kinds of forms. These differences are discussed below. 
Packaged Approach 
The vast majority of D&O coverage written for priv ately held firms is made available on a so-called 
package basis. That is, in addition to offering sta ndard D&O coverage, nearly all of the policies also 
provide coverage for employment practices liability  and fiduciary liability exposures. In addition, 
some policies designed for private companies also afford the option to purchase kidnap/ransom 
coverage (also termed “special crime” coverage) and miscellaneous  professional liability insurance 
(covering corporate accountants and attorneys). 
Flexibility in Limits and Retentions 
Another advantage of the package format is that (in co ntrast to what is made available by insurers of 
publicly held companies) most writers of private co mpany D&O offer a great deal of flexibility in the 
selection of limits and retentions fo r the various coverages. Insurers usually offer either separate or 
combined limits for each of these different types of coverage as well as either separate or combined retentions for each of them.  
For example, under a typical package approach, an insured could elect a combined single limit 
applying to D&O, employment pr actices, and fiduciary liability cove rage. Or, the insured could select Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Coverage 
90 a separate limit for each of these coverages. The same can usually be said for the selection of 
retentions for each of these coverages. That is, th e insured could opt for a separate retention for each 
type of coverage or a single retenti on annual aggregate for all coverages.  
Broad “Insured Persons” Coverage 
Unlike corporate D&O policies, whereby only direct ors and officers are “insured persons,” private 
company policies cover a much broader range of individuals. Specifically, employees (both full and 
part-time) are also insureds under the forms. 
Broad Entity Coverage 
Unlike insurers of publicly held companies, insurers who write privately held firms provide entity 
coverage for all kinds of claims—not just those involving securities. Moreover, entity coverage is 
automatic under D&O policies for private companies,  whereas, under corporate D&O forms, entity 
coverage always requires payment of additiona l premium (i.e., and purchase of Coverage C). 
Duty To Defend 
Virtually all D&O policies for private companies are written on a duty to defend basis. In contrast, the 
vast majority of forms written for publicly traded firms state that the insurer has no duty to defend, 
only a duty to pay defense costs and make indemnity payments.  
However, the duty to defend approach is usually better suited to privately held firms because they 
tend to be smaller and less familiar with the complexiti es of D&O litigation. It is usually best to allow 
the insurer to manage and control the litigation process when private companies are involved, 
compared with the larger, publicly traded companie s that tend to have sizeable legal staffs and are 
more comfortable controlling the litigati on process associated with D&O claims. 
Liberal Cancellation and Nonrenewal Provisions 
The cancellation and nonrenewal provisions in privat e company D&O policies tend to be more liberal 
than those found in their for-profit counterparts. Spec ifically, a majority of such forms are written on 
a non-cancelable basis (except for nonpayment of pr emium). In contrast, the typical corporate D&O 
form requires only 30 to 60 days' notice prior to cancellation.  In addition, most private company forms require the insurer to provide 30 to 60 days' notice prior to 
non-renewing, compared to corporate D&O insurers whose forms generally do not require any prior 
notice of nonrenewal. 
Broad Extended Reporting Provisions 
The extended reporting provisions found in private company D&O forms are usually somewhat 
broader than those made available by corporate D&O writers. For example, private company forms typically offer ERPs of 1 year, for a maximum of 125 percent of the expiring premium and in some cases as low as 50 percent of the expiring premium. Conversely, corporate D&O insurers' ERP premiums are usually a minimum of 100 percent of expiring premium and can be as high as 200 
percent of the expiring premium. In addition, insu rers of privately held companies frequently offer 
ERPs of more than 1 year and for as long a period as 5 years.
