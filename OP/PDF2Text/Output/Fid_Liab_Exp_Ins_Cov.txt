Introduction and Course Overview 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This Web CE course is designed to give a moderately experienced insurance person a detailed look at 
(1) the fiduciary liability exposures that were creat ed by the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA) of 1974 and (2) at the insurance po licies that have been developed to cover these 
liability exposures. 
The first part of the course describes the basic fi duciary duties set forth in ERISA, examines the 
specific types of pension and benefit plans governed by ERISA, and analyzes the particular claims 
exposures created by these duties. Next, the cour se discusses the way in which fiduciary liability 
insurance is underwritten, provides methods of cont rolling exposures to fiduciary liability claims, and 
explains how fiduciary liability c overage is coordinated with othe r types of management liability 
insurance policies. The second part of the cour se takes a detailed look at the specific provisions 
within fiduciary liability insurance policy fo rms, including insuring agreements, covered 
persons/organizations, provisions pertaining to status changes, key definitions, limits/deductibles, conditions, exclusions, an d coverage triggers. 
• Chapter 2 explains the specific fiduciary du ties enumerated within ERISA. These include 
how the law defines a “fiduciary,” the standa rds of care required by fiduciaries, responsibility 
for outside service providers, prohibited transactions, and bonding requirements. 
• Chapter 3 enumerates the types of benefit plans to which ERISA applies. It also describes the 
plans that are exempt from ERISA regulations.  
• Chapter 4 discusses the liability ex posures that result from the th ree major types of employee 
pension plans: (1) defined benefit, (2) defi ned contribution, and (3) cash balance plans. 
Particular focus is directed to exposures from 401(k) plans and the problems resulting from the holding of company stock in these accounts.  
• Chapter 5 explores the key factors that insurers use to price and underwrite fiduciary liability 
coverage. Among the factors discussed include funding adequacy, nature of the plans 
covered, single versus multi-employer plan s, and the profiles of covered fiduciaries. 
• Chapter 6 describes how to reduce the exposures to liability claims that are made against 
fiduciaries. Specific techniques, such as periodic a udits and the use of experts to design plans, 
are discussed in detail. 
• Chapter 7 explains how to coordinate fiduciary liability policies with other related coverages, 
including employee benefits liability endorsements to CGL. It also discusses the advantages Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
2 and disadvantages of including fiduciary liabilit y coverage within so-called management 
liability “package” policy forms.  
• Chapter 8, which begins the detailed discussion of  fiduciary liability policy forms, addresses 
the two major insuring agreements within the pol icies: (1) coverage for fiduciary liability and 
(2) coverage for claims adjudicated unde r what are known as “voluntary settlement 
programs.” 
• Chapter 9 examines the covered pe rsons and covered organizations provisions of the policy.  
Special attention is given to the four types of  assets covered by the policies, as well as to key 
coverage extensions, including coverage for s pouses and personal representatives of insureds. 
• Chapter 10 reviews the manner in which coverage  applies for “status changes,” such as the 
addition of employee benefit plans (e.g., when an insured corporation acquires another 
corporation) and the termination of such plans.  
• Chapter 11 explains how fiduciary liability po licies define and apply several key terms, 
including: covered losses, claim, policy terr itory, defense costs, and claim settlement 
procedures. 
• Chapter 12 describes the functioning of a fiduciary liability policy’s limits and 
retentions/deductibles provisions. Particular a ttention is paid to how they apply in claim 
situations involving multiple claimants, a comm on characteristic of fiduciary liability claims.  
• Chapter 13 describes the important policy conditio ns found within fiduciary liability forms, 
including subrogation/recourse, severability, and managed care exception wording. 
• Chapter 14 looks at the key exclusions found w ithin fiduciary liability policies and discusses 
the rationale for each, and also addresses the sub tle but critical variations within the same 
exclusion contained in the different insurers’ policies.  
• Chapter 15 analyzes the manner in which a fiduc iary liability policy’s coverage triggers 
apply. Within this context, concepts such as claims first-made, post-policy reporting 
windows, retroactive dates, discovery provisi ons, extended reporting and runoff periods are 
treated at length. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Identify the specific fiduciary duties enumerated  within ERISA, state how the law defines 
“fiduciary,” and describe the standards of care required by fiduciaries.  
2. Explain the significance of “prohibited transactions,” and how fiduciaries can avoid them.  
3. List the types of plans that are both included  within and exempted from ERISA regulations. 
4. State the most common fiduciary liability exposures resulting from the three major types of 
employee benefit plans. 
5. Explain the key factors insurers use to underwrite and price fiduciary liability coverage. 
6. Analyze the various methods of preventing claims against fiduciaries. 
7. Describe the ways in which fiduciary liability policies can be (1) coordinated with employee 
benefits liability policies and (2) incorporated  within executive liab ility package policies. 
8. List and describe the two major insuring agre ements found within fiduciary liability policy 
forms. Chapter 1—Introduction and Course Overview 
3 9. Give details concerning the covered persons and covered organizations provisions.  
10. Analyze the way in which coverage under the policies applies to various types of 
organizational “status changes.”  
11. Identify and explain how various coverage term s are defined within the policies, including 
covered losses, claim, policy territory, defen se costs, and claims settlement procedures. 
12. Describe the operation of the policy’s limits and deductibles/retentions provisions, especially within the context of legal actions involving multiple claimants.  
13. Explain the functioning of the following key fiduciary liability policy conditions: subrogation/recourse, severability, a nd managed care exception wording. 
14. Enumerate the exclusions found within the po licies, explain the variations within these

Fiduciary Duties under ERISA 
Chapter Two examines the specific duties enumerated  by the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA), to which fiduciaries must adhere.  
ERISA: The Basics 
The U.S. Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974 to assure 
that employees participating in pension and benefit plans would indeed receive the benefits promised 
by such programs. As a result, the law created numerous fiduciary liability exposures for employers 
that offered these plans, and, in response, fiduciary  liability insurance coverage became available on a 
widespread basis during the mid-1970s. 
According to ERISA’s provisions, persons worki ng within business organizations that design, 
administer, and manage pension and employee benef it plans are fiduciaries. Additionally, there are 
financial institutions (e.g., banks, insurance compan ies) and individuals (e.g., attorneys, actuaries, 
consultants, investment advisers) who also perform  fiduciary duties in conjunction with the pension 
and employee benefit plans sponsored by client compan ies. (There are other types of fiduciaries, such 
as those who manage the assets of children or ment ally incapacitated adults. However, this course 
will address the liability exposures and insurance coverage written for corporate fiduciaries.) Responsibility for the interpretation and enforcemen t of ERISA is divided among the Department of 
Labor, the Department of the Treasury (especially the Internal Revenue Service), and the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
The Purpose of ERISA 
ERISA does not require employers to establish or create benefit or pension plans for its workers. Nor 
does it decree minimum benefit levels if such pl ans have been established. Rather, the essence of 
ERISA is that it regulates the manner in which pens ion and benefit programs must operate once they 
have been put into place. For example, under ERIS A, pension plans are required to provide vested 
benefits for employees after a certain number of year s. (Benefits are “vested” when they become the 
legal property of the designated beneficiary. For example, under most corporate 401(k) savings plans, the portion contributed by the employer normally requires a 3 to 5 year period before such contributions become vested; that is, when the contributions become the legal property of the 
employee on whose behalf the contributions were ma de.) ERISA also mandates that such plans meet 
certain minimum funding requirements.  
ERISA set forth a broad scope of fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, the Act created numerous 
liability exposures for individuals and companies that create and manage pension and employee 
benefit plans. The purpose of ERISA was to develop guidelines for administeri ng such plans so that Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
6 the interests of employee beneficiaries would be saf eguarded. In effect, ERISA is designed to assure 
that those entitled to pensions and benefits are able to collect them. 
Fiduciaries as Defined by ERISA 
According to ERISA, an individual or corporation is considered a fiduciary if that person or 
corporation does any of the following. 
1. Exercises any discretionary authority or discre tionary control in managing the pension or 
benefit plan or exercises any authority or c ontrol in managing or disposing of its assets.  
2. Renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, with respect to any monies or 
other property belonging to the plan.  
3. Has any discretionary authority or responsibility in administering the plan. 
Personal Liability of Fiduciaries under ERISA 
One key aspect of ERISA is that it makes fiduciaries personally liable for breaches of duty. Prior to ERISA, there was no personal liability associated with management of employee pension and benefit plans. Although the fiduciary liability exposure act ually existed prior to the passage of ERISA, 
ERISA not only formalized the law associated w ith the administration of employee pension and 
benefit plans. It also broadened the scope of such lia bility so that it became a “personal” rather than 
simply a “corporate” liability, meaning that the pers onal assets of a fiduciary can be confiscated to 
restore any losses suffered by a covered plan if the losses were caused by the fiduciary’s negligence. 
For example, if Joe Smith, the comptroller at Corpora tion X, who is also a trustee of the corporation’s 
pension plan, is held liable for an error that causes a loss to that plan, Joe’s personal assets could be seized to cover the loss. In other words, in additio n to Corporation X’s assets, Joe’s assets, since he is 
a fiduciary, are also exposed to liability clai ms.   This is illustrated in Exhibit 2.1. 
 
EXHIBIT 2.1 
PERSONAL LIABILITY OF FIDUCIARIES UNDER ERISA 
Sec. 1109. Liability for breach of fiduciary duty 
Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the 
responsibilities, obligations or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall 
be personally liable [emphasis added] to make good to such plan any losses to the 
plan resulting from each such breach, and to  restore to such plan [emphasis added] 
any profits which have been made through use of  assets of the plan by the fiduciary…, 
Source: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of  1974, Title 29, Chapter 18, Subchapter I, Subtitle 
B, Part 4, Sec. 1109. 
Expanding Definitions of Fiduciaries  To Include Corporate Directors 
With the incidence of what is known as ERISA “stock drop” claims (discussed later in this course), a 
number of courts have broadened the definition of “fiduciary” to include the sponsor corporation’s 
board of directors or its compensation committee—if the directors have the authority to appoint 
persons who serve as fiduciaries of the plan. Given their power to appoint fiduciaries, some courts 
have reasoned that corporate directors have a c ontinuing duty to oversee th e performance of those 
they have appointed to these positions. (In most co rporations, executive officers, such as the CEO, 
COO, and CFO, as well as high-level managers such  as the human resources manager or director of 
employee benefits, are appointed as the trustees of corporate benefit plans.)  Chapter 2—Fiduciary Duties under ERISA 
7 Standards of Care Require d of ERISA Fiduciaries 
The ERISA law represents an attempt by the United States Congress to codify the common law 
standard for fiduciary conduct that evolved from the law of trusts. Although ERISA speaks in terms 
of the “prudent man standard of care,” it compels a broader and more stringent standard of conduct 
than mere “prudence.” Rather, the standard to be  met is one of a prudent fiduciary—not a prudent 
man. More specifically, ERISA imposes certain sta ndards of care on fiduciaries. These are noted in 
Exhibit 2.2. 
EXHIBIT 2.2 
STANDARDS OF CARE ERISA IMPOSES ON FIDUCIARIES 
• Exclusive Purpose . Fiduciaries must discharge their duties with respect to a plan, solely 
in the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries.  
• Prudence . Fiduciaries must discharge their duties “with the care, skill, prudence, and 
diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like 
capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like 
character and with like aims.”  
• Diversification. Fiduciaries must diversify the investments of the plan so as to minimize 
the risk of large losses, unless, under the circ umstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so. 
• Plan Documents . Fiduciaries are required to discha rge their duties in accordance with 
the documents and instrument s governing the plan.  
Responsibility for Outside Service Providers 
It is important to note that under ERISA, a fiduciary  can also be held liable for the acts, errors, and 
omissions of a co-fiduciary (also known as an outside service provider). Thus, organizations 
sponsoring employee pension and benefit programs ar e exposed to claims caused by the actions of 
outside entities and organizations that provide administrative services for the plans they sponsor. 
Given the complexity of many pension and benefit programs, several different kinds of specialized 
expertise are typically required to operate such  programs and a number of different firms may be 
involved in servicing a firm’s pension and be nefits programs. The different entities commonly 
providing such expertise are enumerated in Exhibit 2.3. 
 
 
     
 
   Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
8 EXHIBIT 2.3 
OUTSIDE ENTITIES SERVICING PENSION AND BENEFIT PLANS  
Consulting Firms that possess specialized expertise r egarding ERISA are called on to design 
and implement pension and benefit plans. 
Professional Administration Firms  are in the business of performing the day-to-day 
paperwork functions required by  benefit plans (e.g., enrollment, claims processing and 
payments, record keeping, filing r eports with government agencies). 
Actuarial Consulting Firms  must periodically review current pension fund reserve levels and 
certify that such reserves, coupled with predict ed future contributions and expected investment 
returns, will be adequate to meet anticipated paym ents to plan beneficiaries when they retire. 
CPA Firms  perform annual audits of the plans to asce rtain that financial statements accurately 
present the true condition of the plans and that the statements have been prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
Law Firms must review and analyze all important documents associated with the plans and 
ultimately render an opinion regarding the ex tent to which they comply with ERISA. 
Investment Advisers  assist fiduciaries in establishing investment guidelines and in retaining 
and reviewing the performance of investment managers. 
Investment Management Companies  are charged with the duty of investing the assets of 
plans. In accordance with investment objectives  of the plan as specified in the plan documents, 
the managers must achieve optimal levels of dive rsification, capital preservation, and rates of 
return. Bank Trust Departments  are typically in actual possessi on of invested funds (or evidence of 
those funds in the form of stock certificates and bonds, for instance) and may also participate 
in the investment decision-making process. Sometimes they work in conjunction with an independent investment management firm. In other  instances, they are also responsible for 
actually making investment decisions. 
Protection from Liability: The Investment Company Act of 1940 
Despite a fiduciary’s responsibility for the acti ons of outside service providers, it should be 
understood that ERISA does provide fiduciaries with a layer of insulation from liability. Specifically, 
if it can be shown that the fiduciary selected an investment adviser who is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fiduciary ca nnot be held liable for the investment adviser’s 
imprudent investment decisions. In effect, liabilit y can only attach when it can be shown that the 
fiduciary negligently selected the adviser, because it failed to select an adviser who is registered 
under the 1940 Act. 
“Function” versus “Category”  Determines Liability 
It is important to recognize, however, that depending on the specific nature of their duties, not all of 
the persons and entities listed in Exhibit 2.3, ab ove, will be considered fiduciaries under ERISA in 
every instance. This is because “function” rather than “category” is what ultimately controls the 
question of “who is a fiduciary?” For example, a bank that merely holds securities for safekeeping, 
but plays no role in the actual investment decisi on-making process, would probably not be considered 
a fiduciary. In contrast, a bank performing both of these roles would almost certainly be considered a 
fiduciary to the extent of its involvement in the decision-making process. 
 Chapter 2—Fiduciary Duties under ERISA 
9 Prohibited Transactions 
ERISA specifies two kinds of transactions that are prohibited. 
• Self-Dealing . Fiduciaries are prohibited from using plan assets to profit personally (e.g., 
investing pension plan monies in a company in whic h a fiduciary holds a majority interest).    
• Party-in-Interest Transactions. These are otherwise legitimate transactions that are 
prohibited if the transaction is conducted with a “party in interest.” A “party-in-interest” 
includes any fiduciary, legal counsel, employee of the plan, service provider to the plan, 
employer or employee whose employees or members are covered by the plan, and any other person who has a stated interest in, or a relati onship with, a party in interest. For example, 
pension plan funds cannot be used to buy or se ll property to or from or invest any assets with 
any family member of any trustee, or anyone else who is a party-in-interest.  
Penalties for Engaging in Prohibited Transactions 
In the event that a plan engages in a prohibited transaction, it will not be disqualified, although an 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 50 percent excise tax will automatically be levied. This tax rises to 
100 percent if the situation is not corrected within a certain period of time (usually within 90 days). In 
addition, the Department of Labor imposes a 20 percent penalty based on the amount of the 
fiduciary’s breach.  
Exceptions to Prohibited Transactions 
To carve out those prohibited transactions that come within the literal language of ERISA but are not intended to be prohibited, Congress created certain statutory exceptions to what would otherwise be 
considered prohibited transactions. Some of these include (1) exemptions that permit the rendering of reasonable and necessary services; (2) the collection and compromise of disputes concerning 
delinquent contributions from participating employers;  (3) the sale of securities of parties in interest; 
and (4) the receipt of reasonable compensation by certain parties in interest. 
Bonding Requirements under ERISA 
Under ERISA, and effective December 31, 2007, a ll fiduciaries and persons w ho handle plan funds or 
other plan assets must be bonded for 10 percent of the aggregate amount handled, with a minimum 
bond of $1,000 and a maximum bond of $1,000,000. 
It is the insured organization’s responsibility to ma ke certain that all employees with access to plan 
funds are appropriately bonded. Ho wever, fidelity bonding is not re quired of corporate trustees or 
insurance companies with combined  capital and surplus of at least $1 million, if the only assets from 
which benefits are paid are the general assets of th e insured organization or a union. Nor is fidelity 
bonding required if the Secretary of Labor finds that other bonding arrangements or the overall 
condition of the plan are adequate to protect participants. 
Compliance by Endorsement to Corporate Crime Policy 
Compliance with these bonding rules can be attained  by attaching an ERISA Compliance Bond to a 
company’s existing crime policy, assuming the po licy covers employee dishonesty. In effect, 
compliance does not require the purchase of  a separate insurance policy or bond. 
 
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
10 Interestingly, financial institutions are grante d a “regulatory exemption” from these mandatory 
bonding requirements, most likely because financial institutions almost universally maintain ample 
employee dishonesty coverage. ERISA compliance bonds, which, as mentioned above, are merely 
endorsements to existing crime policies, cover lo sses caused by dishonest acts committed by trustees, 
officers, employees, administrators, or managers of insured plans. 
Fiduciary Liability, Employee Benefits Liability, and ERISA Bonding Requirements 
Compared 
There is often confusion regarding the differen ce between fiduciary liability insurance, employee 
benefits liability insurance, and th e bonding requirements under ERISA.  
Fiduciary liability insurance  covers claims alleging breach of discretionary duties specified by the 
1974 ERISA law (e.g., failure to invest plan assets prudently, failure to select a qualified service provider to a covered plan). Insureds under fiduc iary liability policies include both the corporate 
entity that sponsors the covered plans, as well as the individuals who serve as fiduciaries of such 
plans.  
Employee benefits liability  policies cover claims involving nondiscretionary, administrative errors 
pertaining to pension and benefit plans (e.g., fa iling to name an intended beneficiary on a life 
insurance policy, failure to enroll an employee in a company 401(k) plan).  
ERISA bonding requirements apply to fidelity/dishonesty situations  to protect against a fiduciary’s 
illegal appropriation of funds from an employee benefit plan. These requirements necessitate 
purchasing an ERISA Compliance Bond, which, as e xplained above, can be secured by endorsement 
to a corporate crime policy. 
Exhibit 2.4 illustrates the three types of claim s ituations that would be covered under these different 
policies.

Other Important Sections of ERISA 
Two additional, key sections of the ERISA law re quire mention: Section 404(c) and Section 510. 
 
 Chapter 2—Fiduciary Duties under ERISA 
11 ERISA Section 404(c) 
Section 404(c) of ERISA protects a fiduciary agai nst liability for investment losses arising from 
allocation choices in employee-directed retiremen t plans (e.g., 401(k) plans) if the following 
requirements are met. 
• Plan participants can allocate funds among a minimum of three investment choices with 
substantially different risk and return characteristics.  
• Each core investment alternative is sufficiently diversified.  
• Plan participants can transfer from or among th e investment alternatives at least once every 3 
months.  
• Participants can transfer from or among the i nvestment alternatives with a frequency that is 
appropriate to each fund’s risk level.  
• Participants receive sufficient information to  make informed decisions about the plan’s 
investment options.  
Limitations of 404(c) Protections for Fiduciaries 
However, simply providing empl oyees with options that satisfy 404(c) requirements does not 
safeguard a fiduciary against lawsuits for selecti ng funds imprudently, failing to monitor them for 
continuing appropriateness, or engaging in a prohibited transaction.  
Moreover, when losses are attributable to the po or selection of the investment, 404(c) offers no 
protection because the trustee and other fiduciaries ar e required to make prudent decisions regarding 
their selection of investment options. That selection is generally linked to the selection of the mutual 
fund or group annuity provider.  
Finally, fiduciaries are not relieved of other fiducia ry obligations even if they comply with all of 
ERISA 404(c). For example, fiduciaries must con tinue to: (1) prudently select the investment 
alternatives that are available to participants , (2) monitor the investment performance of these 
selections, and (3) prudently carry out the participant’s investment instructions. 
ERISA Section 510 
The purpose of Section 510 is to prevent employers from (1) taking actions that might abridge or 
impair an employee from collecting benefits or (2) taking punitive action against an employee-
participant for exercising his or her rights under an employee benefit plan. Accordingly, employees may pursue claims under Section 510 suits for discharges and other similar employment decisions that threaten the accrual of additional benefits through continuous years of employment (e.g., terminating an employee, without cause, immediately prior to the date on which the employee would have become vested in the company’s pension plan).  
More specifically, Section 510 of ERISA prohibits  employers from (1) discriminating or taking 
adverse action against plan participants or benefici aries for exercising their rights under ERISA plans, 
(2) interfering with participants’ or beneficiarie s’ attainment of rights under ERISA, and (3) 
retaliating against individuals for giving informati on or testifying in any inquiry or proceeding under 
ERISA.  
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
12 However, it should be recognized that while ERIS A prohibits employers from taking adverse actions 
against employees to avoid paying them benefits, em ployers have the unrestricted right to reduce or 
eliminate non-vested benefits by changing the terms of a plan in a way that does not discriminate 
against any sub-group. In enacting ERISA, it w as Congress’s intent to prohibit discrimination in 
administering a welfare benefit plan, but still allowing employers to change the terms of those plans 
as it saw fit.

15 Chapter 3 
Types of Plans Covered and Exempted by ERISA 
Chapter 3 analyzes the two major types of plans to  which the ERISA law applies: employee pension 
benefit plans and employee welfare benefit plans. In addition, this chapter notes the basic 
requirements included within the ERISA law to which these plans must adhere. 
The Two Types of Covered Benefit Plans 
ERISA covers two types of employee benefit plans: (1) employee pension benefit plans and (2) 
employee welfare benefit plans. 
Employee Pension Benefit Plans 
These are plans created by an employer, a union, or both and which provide for retirement income or 
the deferral of income (e.g., 401(k) plans, “traditi onal” defined benefit pension plans, both of which 
will be discussed later in this course).  
Under ERISA, pension plans must provide for vesting of employees’ pension benefits after a 
specified 
minimum number of years. ERISA also requires that the employers who sponsor plans 
satisfy certain minimum funding requirements.  In addition, ERISA regulates the manner in which a pension plan may pay benefits. For example, 
a defined benefit plan must pay a married participan t
 ’s pension as a “joint-and-survivor annuity” that 
provides continuing benefits to the surviving sp ouse unless both the participant and the spouse waive 
the survivor coverage.  
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) w as established by ERISA to provide coverage in 
the event that a terminated defined benefit pension plan do es not ha ve sufficient assets to provide the 
benefits earned by participants. The PBGC will be  discussed in more detail later in this section. 
Employee Welfare Benefit Plans 
These are plans, funds, or programs created by an employer or union for the purpose of providing 
medical, sickness, accident, disability, death, unemp loyment, and vacation benefits, apprenticeships, 
training programs, day care centers, scholarship funds , prepaid legal services, or any benefit allowed 
by the Taft-Hartley Act.  
Again, it is important to stress that ERISA does not require that an employer provide health insurance 
coverage (or any of the aforementioned types of benefit programs) to its employees or retirees, but it 
regulates the operation of a health benefit pl an if an employer chooses to establish one. Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
16 In contrast to employee pension benefit plans a nd employee welfare benefit plans, other types of 
programs are exempt from the law. Exhibit 3.1 enumerates both types

Two Key Amendments to ERISA  
ERISA was later expanded to include two major health laws. Specifically, the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) a nd the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) amended ERISA to make health care coverage more portable 
and secure for employees.  
Continuation of Health Coverage (COBRA) 
The Consolidated Omnibus Budge t Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives workers and their families 
who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue group health bene fits. Such coverage is 
continued for limited periods of time, under certain circumstances, such as voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the hours worked, transition between jobs, death, divorce, and other life events. 
Qualified individuals may be required to pay the entire premium for coverage, up to 102 percent of 
the cost to the plan. 
COBRA requires that group health plans sponsored  by employers with 20 or more employees in the 
prior year offer employees and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health 
coverage (called continua tion coverage) in certain instances wh ere coverage under the plan would 
otherwise end. 
COBRA outlines how employees and family members may elect continuation coverage. It also 
requires employers and plans to provide notice of the option for continuation of coverage. 
Portability of Health Coverage (HIPAA) 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) affords rights and protections for 
participants and beneficiaries in group health plan s. HIPAA includes: (1) protections for coverage 
under group health plans that would otherwise limit or exclude coverage for preexisting conditions, 
(2) prohibitions of discrimination against employees and dependents based on th eir health status, and 
(3) allowance for a special opportunity to enroll in a new plan, to individuals, under certain circumstances.  
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
18 Retiree Health Care Benefits: No t Subject to ERISA Protections 
During the 1990s and 2000s, a number of employer s who promised lifetime healthcare coverage to 
their retired workers discontinued such programs or substantially reduced the scope of benefits paid 
under them. However, ERISA does not mandate the vesting of retiree healthcare benefits in the 
manner that it requires employees to become vested  in pension plans. Nevertheless, employees and 
retirees who had been promised lifetime health c overage by their employers may still be able to 
enforce these promises by suing on a breach of contr act theory or by challenging the right of the 
health benefit plan to change its plan docume nts in order to eliminate promised benefits.  
The ERISA Preemption for Health Care Plans 
As noted above, plans providing health care benef its are governed by ERISA. However, in claims 
involving administration of an ERISA-qualified health  care benefit plan, the Act bars jury trials, 
punitive damage awards, and limits  damages to actual medical e xpenses incurred. Additionally, 
claims associated with employer-provided medical  plans are not generally covered by fiduciary 
liability policies, because fiduciary liability policy forms routinely contain exclusions for bodily 
injury.  
The Managed Care Exception Endorsement 
Nevertheless, in recent years, insu rers have begun to attach, via endorsement, an important exception 
to this exclusion for coverage of bodily injury  claims associated with employer-provided health 
insurance coverage. Specifically, by means of so-called managed care exception endorsements, 
fiduciary liability insurers “except”—and therefor e cover—bodily injury, sickness, mental or 
emotional distress, disease, or death, when such  events result from the administration of managed 
health care plans. The two most common claim scenarios associated with the managed care exposures 
involve an injured employee-claimant suing an employer sponsor of a managed health care plan, 
alleging: 
1. that the employer-sponsor of a managed health  care plan negligently selected the managed 
health care plan provider; and/or 
2. that the employer-sponsor of a managed health  care plan wrongly denied or delayed medical 
benefits provided by the plan.  
Absent a managed care endorsement that “excepts” (and therefore covers) bodily injury when it arises from managed care plan administration, coverage would otherwise be excluded for these scenarios. 
However, this coverage is an important aspect of fiduciary liability policy forms since such plans are 
subject to ERISA and fiduciaries are exposed to pe rsonal liability as a result. This aspect of coverage 
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 13  of this course.

21 Chapter 4 
Liability Exposures Associated with Employee Pension Benefit Plans 
As already noted, ERISA governs two types of em ployee benefit plans: employee pension benefit 
plans and employee welfare benefit plans. By far,  the larger of the two exposures to which ERISA 
fiduciaries are subject is in conjunction w ith employee pension benefit plans.   
Chapter 4 discusses the liability claim exposures r esulting from the three major types of employee 
pension benefit plans: (1) defined benefit plans, (2) defined contribution plans, and (3) cash balance 
plans. 
Types of Employee Pension Benefit Plans 
There are three types of employee pension benefit plans. 
• Defined benefit pension plans. These are retirement plans in which an employer promises to 
pay a specific monthly benefit amount (or a lump sum) at retirement, based on a 
predetermined formula. For example, based upon an employee’s years of service, age, and 
salary during the final 10 years, he/she will receive a specific monthly pension payment for life. Such plans are often referred to as "traditional" pension plans.  
• Defined contribution pension plans.  These plans provide no guarantee of a specific benefit 
amount. However, unlike defined benefit pension plans, under defined contribution plans, the 
employee has a separate retirement account in which he or she has an ownership interest. 
401(k) plans are the most common type of defined contribution plan. Under such plans, 
employees contribute anywhere from 1 to 15 percent of their annual salary each year to a savings plan. The employer will usually match one-half of the employee’s contribution, most often up to 6 percent of the employee’s contribution. For example, if an employee contributes 6 percent of her salary to the 401(k) plan, th e employer will contribute an additional 3 
percent, so that the employee will have saved a total of 9 percent of her annual salary (i.e., 6 
percent contribution, plus 3 percent employer match.) According to the Department of Labor, 
there are an estimated 437,000 defined contribution plans in operation, covering 65 million participants.    
• Cash-balance pension plans.  These plans are a “hybrid” of defined benefit and defined 
contribution plans. Under such plans, the employer makes contributions to the pension plan, 
but the accrued benefits are defined in terms of an individual account balance. Legally, 
however, the plans are defined benefit plans, because the employees do not actually own the individual accounts. Cash balance plans offer a guaranteed benefit like a traditional pension, Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
22 but generally provide longtime workers with lo wer accrued benefits, compared to defined 
benefit pension plans. 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
As has been the dominant trend since the early 1 980s, the nation’s employers have been moving away 
from offering defined benefit pension plans. This is especially true among the country’s 100 largest 
companies. According to a study by Watson Wyatt Worl dwide, in 2006, more than four in ten within 
this group offered new workers only defined contributi on plans, such as 401(k) plans. In contrast, just 
31 offered defined benefit pension plans. The study also noted that in 1985, 89 of the 100 largest companies offered defined benefit pension plans.  
Assuring Pension Plan Solvency: The Pension Benefit G uaranty Corporation 
(PBGC)  
To assure that pension plans set up by corporations will be able to honor their payment obligations to employees, the PBGC was established as a part of ERISA. The mission of the PBGC, which is an independent agency of the federal government, is to: (1) encourage the continuation and maintenance 
of voluntary private defined benefit pension plans and (2) to provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits when the plans themselves are financially unable to do so.   
The PBGC is comprised of two programs, one for single-employer pension plans and another for 
multi-employer pension plans. Multi-employer plans are set up by collectively-bargained agreements 
involv
ing more than one unrelated employer, generally in one industry. As of 2008, the single-
employer program protected 34.0 million workers and retirees in 28,800 pension plans. The multi-
employer program protected 9.9 million workers and retirees in 1,540 pension plans.  
As of 2008, the PBGC paid monthly retirement be nefits to approximatel y 631,000 retirees of 3,800 
terminated defined benefit pension plans and was responsible for the current and future pensions of 
about 1.3 million people. Payments are based upon a retirement age of 65. When a beneficiary retires 
at an earlier age or elects a survivor benefit, benefit levels are adjusted downward. When a 
beneficiary retires after age 65, the benefit amount is adjusted upward. Additionally, the PBGC will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the 5-year period immediately prior to a plan's termination nor does it guarantee benefits that are not payable over a retiree's lifetime. 
For single-employer plans, in 2008, workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $4,312.50 a month 
(or $51,750 a year) under PBGC's insurance program for single-employer plans. For multi-employer 
plans, the amount guaranteed is based on a formul a dependent upon the employee’s years of service. 
For plans that terminate after December 21, 2000, the PBGC insures 100 percent of the first $11 
m
onthly payment per year of service and 75 percent of the next $33 monthly payment per year of 
service. For example, if a participant works 20 years in a plan that promises $19 per month per year of service, the PBGC guarantee would be $340 per m onth. Multi-employer plans that terminated after 
1980 but before December 21, 2000, had a maximum guarantee limit of 100 percent of the first $5 of 
the m 
onthly benefit accrual rate a nd 75 percent of the next $15. 
Funding for the PBGC comes from the following sources: 
• Insurance premiums paid by employers who sponsor defined bene fit pension plans  
• Assets held by the pension plans that the PBGC takes over  
• Recoveries of unfunded pension liabilities from plan sponsors' bankruptcy estates, and investment income  Chapter 4—Liability Exposures Associat ed with Employee Benefit Pension 
Plans 
23 The Pension Protection Act of 2006 
The Pension Protection Act, passed in 2006, is one of  the most important pieces of pension-related 
legislation passed since the enactment of ERISA in 1974. The key provisions of the Act affected two 
major areas: (1) the PBGC and (2) defined contribution (i.e., 401 (k)) plans. 
The following changes to the PBGC were made: 
• A requirement that a company must have in its defined benefit pension fund 92 percent of the 
money needed to meet its pension obligations in 2008, 94 percent in 2009, 96 percent in 
2010, and 100 percent by 2011. 
• A change in the methodology for calculating the PBGC premium.  
• A limitation of the PBGC's guarantee of pension benefits that become payable when a 
manufacturing plant is shut down.   
• A freezing of employees’ pension benefits if the PBGC takes over a terminated plan, as of the 
date of the plan sponsor's bankruptcy filing (whi ch may be months or even years before the 
plan terminates).  
• Simplification of the complicated rules govern ing the PBGC's pension guarantee for business 
owners.  
• Addition of a requirement that if the PBGC tak es over a terminated plan, the plan sponsor is 
required to pay a "termination premium" of $1, 250 per participant per year for 3 years.  
Changes to defined contribution plans were: 
• Higher dollar contribution amounts were allowed for 401(k) savings plans, including “catch-
up” contributions for older workers. 
• Addition of several provisions regarding auto matic enrollment in 401(k) plans, whereby 
every new employee is automatically enrolle d in the company’s plan, unless the employee 
specifically opts out of enrollment.   
• A rule stating that matching contributions must be 100 percent vested after 3 years or must be vested at the rate of 20 percent per year beginning with the second year. 
• Added diversification rights allowing participants to diversify out of an employer’s stock into 
a different form of investment.  
• A provision allowing an employer to provide investment advice through what is known as an “eligible investment advice arrangement.” Such investment advice is generated by an unbiased computer model. (Employers have been traditionally reluctant to provide investment 
advice, for fear of liability arising from unfavorable investment outcomes based on such advice.) 
• Added portability rights so th at non-spouse beneficiaries can roll over assets inherited from a 
401(k) plan into an individual retirement acc ount (IRA) and avoid tax on the rollover until the 
assets are actually withdrawn. 
Exposures from Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
There are several fiduciary liability exposures generated by defined benefit pension plans. These 
include (1) exposures related to actuarial solvency, (2 ) conversion of a defined benefit pension plan to 
cash balance defined benefit pension plans, (3) merg ers/terminations of plans, (4) plan disclosures, Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
24 (5) imprudent investment of assets, (6) failure to  pursue delinquent contributions, (7) negligence not 
involving discretionary activities, and (8) claims involving securities backed by subprime loans.  
Actuarial Solvency 
The major exposure to which defined benefit pensi on plans are susceptible is a lack of actuarial 
solvency. (Actuarial solvency is a situation in which, based upon certain key assumptions, such as the 
expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the mortality experience of the pension plan’s 
beneficiaries, that a pension plan will have suffici ent funds with which to pay all benefits that are 
promised by the plan.) As noted, such plans prom ise to pay employee-beneficiaries a specific amount 
of money from the time they retire until the end of  their lives (or, in the case of employees who elect 
a joint survivor annuity, to a beneficiary). This amount is usually based on a formula that factors in: 
(1) years of service, (2) age at retirement, and (3) earnings during the last 5–10 years of employment.  
The ability to pay such benefits is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, the most important of 
which are employee mortality and expected rate of return on employer contributions to the pension 
fund. If, however, such assumptions prove to be incorrect, a defined benefit pension fund may be 
unable to pay promised benefits to its beneficiaries.  Therefore, the solvency risk is the single largest 
exposure faced by defined benefit pension plans. 
The wrongful acts producing such claims are usually committed by those responsible for 
administering an insured firm's benefit plan. For ex ample, a common claim scenario is one in which a 
defined benefit pension fund is  unable to pay promised benef its because it had been seriously 
underfunded for a long period of time and/or because its actual rate of return on funds is much lower 
than the rate that was anticipated  when the original plan was devi sed. Beneficiaries then sue the 
company's employee benefits manager and/or those responsible for administering the pension plan, alleging that the administrators were negligent in funding the plan.   
Conversions from Defined Benefit Pension Plans to Cash Balance Pension Plans 
In the past decade, a number of large employers ha ve restructured their defined benefit pension plans 
to cash balance plans, in the process producing a numb er of claims. Before analyzing the nature of 
such claims, the essential features of cash balan ce and defined benefit plans will be discussed and 
compared.  
Cash Balance Pension Plans versus Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
A cash balance plan makes two promises to employees. First, that an employer will contribute an amount equal to a percentage of each year of the employee’s earnings. Second, it promises a specific rate of return on that contribution. Under a cash balance plan, the benefit is always expressed as a 
total account balance held by an individual employee 
This is in contrast to a defined benefit pension plan, which promises an employee a flat dollar pay-out 
(either on a periodic, usually monthly, or on a lump-s um basis), based on: (1) years of service, (2) age 
at retirement, and (3) an employee's earnings in the years closest to retirement. On the other hand, 
distributions from cash balance plans are usually offered in the form of a lump sum payment, 
although these plans are legally required to offer an annuity option.  
Cash balance plans build value steadily and often at the same pace for all employees, regardless of 
their length of service. The focus of these plans is  on wealth building and portability. Conversely, 
defined benefit plans are aimed at encouraging career  employment with a single employer. Instead of Chapter 4—Liability Exposures Associat ed with Employee Benefit Pension 
Plans 
25 focusing on wealth, their aim is to provide re tirement security. The design of these plans does not 
reward employees who change jobs. 
Why Employers Like Cash Balance Plans 
Cash balance plans appeal to empl oyers because they (1) allow them to more easily determine their 
liability for future payments to employees, (2) help to attract and retain workers in a more mobile 
employment environment in which people frequent ly change jobs, and (3) avoid the difficulties 
involved in explaining defined benefit plans and their often-complex formulas. 
Why Claims Arise in Conjunction with Cash Balance Conversions 
The key “driver” of claims from cash balance conversions is the assertion that younger employees 
typically fare better than they would under the original defined benefit plan that is being phased out. 
This is because the accrual pattern under a cash balance plan provides them with a larger benefit if 
they leave their current employer. On the other ha nd, older workers with more years of service may 
not do as well. In response to these conversi ons, in which older employees would experience 
significant reductions in their bene fit levels, lawsuits have been filed against employers with the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO C) alleging illegal reduction of benefits.  
Restrictions on Plan Changes 
ERISA places restrictions on pension plan changes,  including amendments that convert a defined 
benefit pension plan formula to a cash bala nce plan. Such restrictions require that: 
• Advance notification is required if, as a result of the amendment, the rate at which plan 
participants may earn benefits in the future is significantly reduced.  
• Other legal requirements must be satisfied, incl uding prohibitions against age discrimination. 
In addition, there are prohibitions of discrimi nation against lower income and non-managerial 
workers.   
• Employers who amend their plans to reduce the rate at which future benefits are earned are prohibited from reducing the benefits that particip ants have already earned. In other words, an 
employee may not receive less than his or her accrued benefit under the plan formula at the effective date of the amendment.  
Mergers/Termination of Plans 
Claims are frequently made when companies merge a nd pension or benefit plans are terminated in the 
process. For example, Firm A is acquired by Firm B. Firm A's pension plan is then merged into Firm 
B's, with a subsequent reduction in expected pe nsion benefits for the employees of Firm A, the 
acquired company. At the time of the acquisition, however, the managers of the plan fail to communicate these benefit reductions to the affected workers. Ten years later, when the workers are eligible to receive their pension benefits and they are not as high as expected, the workers sue the 
fiduciaries for failing to communicate these changes. 
Plan Disclosures 
Claims often result because of the way in which be nefit plan changes are communicated to workers. 
Here is a typical claim scenario. Company A asserts that it has no plans to improve the benefits available under its current defi ned benefit pension plan. Then, the company provides an early 
retirement offer to its workers and some, but no t all of these workers accept the offer. Shortly Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
26 thereafter, Company A is acquired by Company B,  which provides enhanced retirement benefits 
compared to the workers of Company A. Those who accepted the early retirement offer sue Company 
A, alleging that Company A knew it would soon be acquired by Company B and therefore sought to 
reduce its pension liabilities by making early  retirement offers to its workers. 
Imprudent Investment of Assets 
Claims alleging imprudent investment of assets frequently involve situations where a high percentage 
(e.g., 20 percent or more) of a defined benefit pension fund's assets are invested in a single company's common stock. For example, assume that the compan y in whose stock the pens ion plan is invested 
then begins to experience financial difficulties a nd eventually files for bankruptcy protection. The 
pension plan suffers a severe loss when the st ock is rendered nearly worthless and a claim for 
imprudent investment of assets is made against the pension fiduciaries by its beneficiaries.  
Failure To Pursue Delinquent Contributions 
Such claims most often arise when a multi-employer pension fund (typically found in unionized, manufacturing industries) becomes insolvent because the pension trustee had been lax in obtaining periodic employer contributions from one of the major participants in the fund. 
Negligence Not Involving Discretionary Activities 
Claims within this category typically involve losses arising from administrative errors. For example, a 
company's employee benefits administrator inadve rtently forgets to enroll a new employee in the 
company’s health insurance program. When the employee is admitted to the hospital following a 
severe auto accident, the employee learns  that he has no health insurance. 
Claims Associated with Securities Backed by Subprime Loans 
Recently, a growing number of plaintiffs are asserti ng that pension plan fiduciaries were negligent in 
making investments in securities backed by subprime  loans (i.e., mortgage-backed securities). Claims 
are being brought against: (1) fiduciaries of the pl ans, (2) outside investment managers, and (3) 
directors who have the power to appoint fiduciaries and monitor the plans.  
When plans sustain losses because the values of these mortgage-b acked securities fall, claimants 
allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary du ties to invest prudently, diversify appropriately, 
and failed to provide investors with complete and acc urate information about the nature of the plan’s 
investments.  
Claims Associated with Pension Moni es Invested in Fraudulent Schemes 
In December of 2008, it was revealed that Be rnard Madoff had been operating an investment 
company for more than a decade that, in reality, was nothing more than a massive Ponzi Scheme. 
Specifically, early investors in the company were “paid back” with monies provided by recent investors as a means of hiding the company’s losses. O fficials have indicated that investors appear to 
have been severely defrauded by Madoff, perhaps to the extent of $50 billion. It has also been 
revealed that monies from a number of prominent, union-sponsored pension funds were “invested” in the scheme. Although no claims have yet been made, they are almost certain to follow in succeeding 
months. Most likely, the claims will allege that pe nsion fund managers were negligent in failing to 
discern the fraudulent nature of the Madoff operation a nd that, had they done so, the managers would 
not have entrusted such monies to Madoff.  Chapter 4—Liability Exposures Associat ed with Employee Benefit Pension 
Plans 
27 Exposures from Defined Contribution Plans 
There are a number of liability exposures faced by fiduciaries from the administration of defined 
contribution plans. These exposures include: (1) concen tration of assets in company stock (i.e., stock 
in the company sponsoring the plan), (2) blackout periods, (3) lack of guidance regarding investment 
strategies, (4) failure to follow the investment re quest of a plan participant, (5) allegations of 
excessive defined benefit plan fees and (6) losses su stained from the 2008 stock market crash. Each of 
these exposures will be discussed below. The lo sses sustained from such exposures are often 
collectively referred to as “ERISA stock drop” claims. 
The Enron Corporation situation provides a ca se study of how each of these three exposures 
contributed to liability claims made against the fiduciaries responsible for administering Enron's 
401(k) plan. In December 2001, when Enron file d for bankruptcy protection, its stock price 
plummeted to less than $1 per share. Since its employee 401(k) plan holders maintained 
approximately 60 percent of their total 401(k) f unds in Enron Corporation stock, the employees 
suffered severe losses. 
Clearly, fiduciaries at firms with high concentrati ons of 401(k) assets invested in their organization's 
common stock face a significant exposure to liability claims. When the value of stock experiences a 
precipitous decrease in value, fiduciaries are at  risk. Under such circumstances, 401(k) plan 
participants are likely to allege that intentiona l, improper internal accounting practices artificially 
inflated the company's earnings, which in turn had th e same effect on the stock price. Plaintiffs allege 
that plan fiduciaries were aware of such accounti ng practices, that they misrepresented to plan 
participants the value and safety of the compan y's stock, and that the fiduciaries encouraged 
investment in the stock to support an artificially hi gh price for the stock. Ultimately, the fiduciaries of 
a defined contribution plan have a duty to tell the truth about the company's stock, encourage 
diversification of investments within the 401(k) pl an, and make participants aware of the need to 
invest in other vehicles. In the absence of such actions, they face considerable liability. (Note: 
currently, there are no laws that restrict employees from investing more than a certain percentage of 
their 401(k) contributions in company stock.)  
Concentration of Employer  Stock in 401(k) Plans 
Studies have indicated that, 6 years after the Enro n collapse, company stock is still the largest 
employee holding in 401(k) plans.  More specifi cally, a 2006 study by Hewitt Associates, a human 
resources consulting firm, found that over 20 percent of all 401(k) monies are invested in company stock. Moreover, one in five plan participants have at least half their retirement money invested in 
company shares, the study revealed.   
The 10 Percent Rule 
Financial advisers usually recommend that employees invest no more than 10 percent of their retirement money in their company's stock.  Althou gh investment in company stock remains high, the 
proportion of money in company stock within such plans has declined since the Enron bankruptcy. 
Specifically, in 2004, about one-fourth of total 401(k) money was invested in employer stock, but 
only about one-fifth in 2006. In addition, in 2006, only about 40 percent of employees in their 20s had 
any company stock in their 401(k) account, compared  with around 60 percent in 1998, according to a 
report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.  
  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
28 Why Concentration of Employer Stock in 401(k) Plans Remains High 
Companies that promote the ownership of company stock in 401(k) plans believe that encouraging 
employees to own stock creates an “ownership cu lture” in which employees will be even more 
committed to the firm’s success. Such companies often match employee contributions on a dollar-for-
dollar basis when these monies are used to buy company stock. This compares to the typical 401(k) plan that matches only 50 percent of an employee’s contributions and only up to 6 percent of the amount contributed.  
For example, assume an employee’s salary is $50,000 , that she contributes 6 percent of her salary, 
and that the employer will match 50 percent of the employee’s 6 percent contribution. In this 
instance, the employee contributes $3,000 (i.e., 6 per cent of $50,000) and the employer adds $1,500 
(i.e., 3 percent of $50,000) for a total of $4,5 00. If the employee were to contribute a higher 
percentage of her salary, say 10 percent, the empl oyer would not make any additional contribution. 
So in this case, if the employee put in 10 percent, or $5,000, and the employer contributed $1,500, this would total $6,500.  
In contrast, under some 401(k) programs in whic h employees use their contributions to buy company 
stock (and using the numbers in the previous paragraph), employers will match the employee’s 
contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to as much  as 10 percent. Thus, if the employee were to 
contribute 10 percent of her salary for company stock (i.e., $5,000), the employer would match this 
amount with an additional $5,000, for a total contribu tion of $10,000, compared to just $6,500 in the 
example above. Obviously, programs of this nature encourage heavy investment in company stock by 
401(k) plan participants.      
Vivien versus WorldCom 
This case established a legal theory that permitted workers to recover losses in their 401(k) retirement plans that contain investments in their employers’ stock. 
The basis of the suit was that WorldCom Retirement Plan administrators were “company insiders.” 
As such, they were well aware that the company’ s share price was highly in flated. This was because 
these insiders knew about the material misstatements contained within its periodic financial filings to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). When  the public eventually learned the true nature 
of the company’s financial condition, WorldCom’s stock price collapsed and 401(k) plan holders saw the value of their accounts plummet. 
Plaintiff-employees alleged that under ERISA, Worl dCom had a fiduciary dut y to participants, and 
that this duty mandated the trustees of the 401(k) plan to invest plan assets in a prudent manner. The 
lawsuit stated that this duty was breached when  the trustees, who, as noted above were “company 
insiders,” continued to invest plan assets in Worl dCom stock. They maintained such investments 
despite the fact that the trustees knew the compa ny’s share price in no way reflected WorldCom’s 
actual value. As a result, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that the trustees had, in fact 
breached their fiduciary duty. 
The Vivien  decision provided the legal framework for many similar suits filed by employees of 
companies such as AOL Time Warner, Reliant Energy, Tyco International, and others. As a result of 
these claims, many major companies restructured their 401(k) plans, by eliminating previous 
requirements that plan participants own certain amounts of company stock. Chapter 4—Liability Exposures Associat ed with Employee Benefit Pension 
Plans 
29 The Blackout Exposure 
Another exposure created by 401(k) plans is one that exists when plan participants are not permitted 
to change their investments during a specific peri od of time. This most often occurs when a 401(k) 
plan changes administrators, for a period of time typically lasting from 4 to 6 weeks. 
In the Enron situation, a blackout exposure resulted when the company changed 401(k) plan 
administrators. Lawyers for Enron's employee-plain tiffs claimed that Enron breached its fiduciary 
duty to workers when it mandated a “freeze” or “blackout” that prevented employees from selling 
their shares of Enron stock during this period. Specifically, workers alleged that they were unable to access their accounts from October 21 to November 19, a period in which Enron’s stock price fell from $26.05 to $9.25.  
Regardless of the length of the blackout period in the Enron situation, the fiduciaries of any firm 
sponsoring a 401(k) plan face an exposure to claims under these conditions. Not only does this 
situation create an exposure when the overall stock ma rket is declining rapidly, but such an exposure 
is exacerbated when a high concentration of 401( k) plan assets are invested in a single stock—
namely, the company's. This is because a single company’s stock is much more prone to drop 
significantly during the time in which there is a chan ge on administrators, compared to the likely drop 
in the overall stock market (as represented by St andard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks), during a 
comparable period of time.  
Restrictions on Selling Matching Company Stock Contributions 
As already noted, depending on the individual plan, an employee's contributions are typically 
matched to some extent by the employer. Most often, a company will match 50 percent of each dollar 
contributed by the employee, up to 6 percent of the employee's salary. However, under some 401(k) 
plans, the company will match the employee's contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and up to 10 percent of the employee's salary. 
Dollar-for-Dollar Matches Only Available on Company Stock 
Usually, 10 percent matches are only available in the form of company stock. Moreover, in most such 
companies, and as was the case with Enron, matching company stock cannot be sold by a worker until 
a certain age, typically 50 (in Enron's case), or even 55. This contrasts with a mere 4 percent of 
employers, according to Fidelity Investments, that  allow a participant to immediately sell matching 
contributions of company stock.  
Again, when employees are locked into the matching contributions of  company stock until age 50 or 
55, the fiduciaries of such companies are exposed  to additional liability. This is because the 
company’s employees may be unable to sell their company stock in a weak, overall stock market or 
when financial reversals within the organizati on itself contribute to a declining price for the 
company’s stock. 
Lack of Guidance Regarding Investment Strategies 
Under ERISA, fiduciaries can face liability for an employee participant's losses within a 401(k) plan 
when fiduciaries provide advice regarding investme nt strategies and personal financial planning.  
 
 
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
30 Hiring Outside Advisors 
A number of organizations attempt to mitigate this exposure by hiring outside financial experts and 
counselors to personally assist employees with their investment choices. However, even this approach does not completely absolve employer-fiduciaries from liability, because fiduciaries can still be held 
responsible if they negligently selected such adviser s. Given this situation, a number of firms simply 
do not provide employees with any investment assistan ce, which often leads to allegations that they 
failed to exercise their fiduciary duties. 
Failure to Follow the Request of a Plan Participant ( LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & 
Assocs., Inc ) 
In LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & Assocs., Inc., (2008), the U.S. Supreme Court issued its most 
important ruling in a fiduciary liab ility case in more than 20 years. The Court’s finding is significant 
because it is likely to result in an increase in the number of claims alleging that corporate fiduciaries committed errors in managing individual 401(k) accounts.  
The general rule that emerged from this case is that employees can now sue fiduciaries not only for 
acts that cause harm to an overall 401(k) plan, but also for damage to individual 401(k) accounts. 
James LaRue sued his former employer for failure to  transfer assets in his 401(k) account to less risky 
investments, as Mr. LaRue had instructed. He asserte d that such failure caused him to lose $150,000. 
The key point of contention in this case was the qu estion of whether Section 502(a)(2) of the ERISA 
law permitted claims to be brought for losses incurred by individual benefit plan participants like Mr. 
LaRue, or whether such claims were limite d only to losses sustained by the entire plan. 
In a unanimous 9–0 ruling, the Court reversed  its earlier holding in the 1985 case of Massachusetts 
Life Ins. Co. v. Russell . In that case, the Court barred suits by individuals, instead only allowing 
claims when a fiduciary’s error caused an entire plan to sustain losses. But in LaRue, the Court 
overturned its earlier finding, this time concluding that Mr. LaRue could sue for damages suffered to 
his individual account. 
It is important to recognize, however, that with its decision, the U.S. Supreme Court did not find the 
fiduciary liable to the plaintiff, LaRue. Rather, the Court’s ruling only means th at the plaintiff has the 
right to prove that the fiduciary’s negligence caused his loss, an issue that must be relitigated in a trial 
court. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, the plaintiff would have been barred from even 
attempting to prove the fiduciary’s negligence, sin ce fiduciaries could only have been held liable for 
losses incurred by an entire plan, rather than those incurred by an individual (which was what happened here). 
The Court’s conclusion reflects the changing rea lity of pension plans since the days of the 
Massachusetts Life  decision. At that time, defined benefit pension plans were still the norm, whereas 
today, defined contribution pension plans (i.e., 401(k) s) are by far the predominant retirement vehicle 
offered to employees. Since defined benefit pensi on plans are quickly disappearing, while defined 
contribution/401(k) plans are now the norm, the Court’s ruling recognizes the reality that a fiduciary’s 
error can indeed cause damage to an individual’s 401(k) account, without doing likewise to the assets 
of an entire 401(k) plan. In other words, what  was a significant loss for LaRue, may have only 
represented a relatively small percentage of the entire plan’s assets. Regardless of what one thinks of the Court’s conclusion in LaRue , it does seem to open the door to an increase in claims against 
fiduciaries because now, individual 401(k) plan holders will have the right to sue fiduciaries for errors and omissions that affect their individual accounts.  Chapter 4—Liability Exposures Associat ed with Employee Benefit Pension 
Plans 
31 Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s February 2008 decision in the LaRue  case, a number of 
commentators expected there would be a flood of litigation. While it is still too early to tell if this will 
happen, in October 2008, Mr. LaRue voluntarily dismis sed his case in the district court, where it was 
sent back after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision. Essentially, he concluded that it was not financially feasible to continue his claim, given th e magnitude of legal costs, relative to what he 
would probably be able to recover in actual damag es. Accordingly, the true extent of the exposure, 
created by the holding of this case, remains to be seen.  
Claims Alleging Excessive Fees 
A number of lawsuits have charged that the sponsors of defined contribution plans have allowed plan administrators and other plan service providers to charge excessive fees, which constitutes a breach of 
duty under ERISA.  
In addition to these allegations, la wsuits have also charged that service providers levy excessive fees 
on defined contribution plans so that the sponsoring corporation can obtain other services more 
cheaply. For example, an investment management fi rm may charge an unusually high fee to manage 
401(k) plan assets in return for charging a lower-tha n-average fee for a line of credit to the sponsoring 
company. This too constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA, because the sponsor is profiting at the expense of the beneficiar ies of its defined contribution plan.  
Over a long period of time, a difference of 1 to 2 pe rcent in fees can make a substantial difference in a 
plan holder’s balance. For instance, assume a person contributes $2,500 to a 401(k) plan for 40 years, 
receives a $1,000 annual company match, and the portfolio grows at a rate of 7.5 percent, the person 
would have approximately $1.2 million at the end of that time. However, if the person was charged an 
extra 1.5 percent in fees, they will have paid out an additiona l $500,000 in fees!  
The Stock Market “Crash” of 2008 
During the Summer and Fall of 2008, the United States and world stock markets dropped 
substantially, due in part to the s ub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. In the U.S. market, the 
S&P 500, at one point, dropped by approximately 40 percent from its previous high reached during 
the Fall of 2007. It is estimated that approximately $2 trillion in 401(k) plan assets were lost during 
this period, as a result. Given the coming wave of  Baby Boomer generation retirements, this is also 
expected to produce considerable ERISA-related litig ation. Again, such exposure will be exacerbated 
by 401(k) plans holding substantial amounts of company stock.

a. All employees are given a subscription to Money Magazine. 
b. Benefits administrators and fiduciaries may not give employees investment advice in any 
form. 
c. Employee meetings are held at which the fiduciaries describe investment strategies. 
d. Fiduciaries select and pay financial consulta nts to give personal advice to employees. 
 
 
Answers to Chapter 4 Review Questions 
1. b. Defined benefit pension plans are retirement plans in which an employer promises to pay a specific 
monthly benefit amount (or a lump sum) at retirement, based on a predetermined formula. 
2. d. The law does not permit employers to charge for this service. Employers will therefore not be able 
to generate revenue by offering such a model. 
3. b. The ability to pay such benefits is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, the most important 
of which are employee mortality and expected rate of return on employer contributions to the pension 
fund. 
4. d. A defined benefit pension plan promises a flat dollar pay-out either on a periodic (usually monthly) 
or lump-sum basis based on years of service, ag e at retirement, and employee earnings in the years 
immediately preceding retirement.  
5. a. The best way to prevent such suits is to communicate the benefit reductions. 
6. c. Increasing the amount of the employer’s contribution is an added benefit to employees and would 
therefore decrease the extent of fiduciary liability exposure. 
7. d. Concentration in one stock represents a lack of diversification and violates fiduciaries’ duty to 
encourage diversification and make participants aware of the need to invest in other vehicles. 
8. a. The magazine provides a neutral source of gene ral advice, addressed to a broad audience, that 
probably cannot be construed as improper guidance by the plan’s fiduciaries. Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage

Underwriting Fiduciary Liability Insurance 
Chapter 5 describes the major factors that are i nvolved in the process of underwriting fiduciary 
liability insurance policies. 
Factors in Pricing 
As is characteristic of most types of professiona l liability insurance, there is no rating bureau or 
pooling of loss experience among insurers writing fiduciary liability coverage. Thus, each company 
must develop its own rating appro ach based on actuarial analysis of its individual loss experience. 
Pricing is therefore subjective and depends on an  underwriter's individual judgment concerning any 
particular fiduciary liability risk. 
Premiums for fiduciary liability insurance are most  heavily influenced by (1) the total assets of the 
insured plans and (2) the number of participants in th e plan. In addition, the nature of such plans (e.g., 
a 401(k) program with a heavy concentration of employer stock) plays a role in determining 
premium. Accordingly, premiums are also affect ed by the underwriter's subjective assessment of a 
given risk, rather than by applying a strict rating formula. 
Underwriting Factors 
In deciding whether to insure a given organization, underwriters consider a number of key factors in 
underwriting fiduciary liability covera ge. Such factors are listed in Exhibit 5.1 and discussed in the 
pages that follow. 
 
EXHIBIT 5.1 
FIDUCIARY LIABILITY UNDERWRITING FACTORS  
• Funding adequacy  
• Nature of plan investments  
• Single-employer versus multi-employer plans  
• Types of covered plans  
• Legal counsel's opinion  
• Profile of covered fiduciaries and direct ors and officers of the organization  
• Formal loss control program Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
36 Funding Adequacy 
A paramount consideration in assessing the insurability of a fiduciary liability risk is the adequacy 
with which defined benefit plans are funded. To make the assessment as to whether contributions to 
the plan will be large enough to pay promised future  benefits, underwriters must rely on the opinions 
of an actuary. Therefore, any qualifications or caveat s that appear in their actuarial reports should be 
carefully scrutinized and immediate chang es made where shortfalls appear likely. 
Nature of Plan Investments 
The nature of the investments for both a defined be nefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan 
is another important factor that underwriters assess.  
Regarding a defined benefit pension plan, underwriters evaluate th e investments: diversification, 
assumed rate of return, overall level of risk, and ma turity structure. Since the duty to diversify assets 
is continually stressed throughout ERISA, underwr iters carefully review situations where a large 
percentage of a plan's funds are invested in a singl e investment vehicle. The extent to which a plan's 
portfolio is invested in "speculative" investments is  also critical. Finally, the maturity structure of the 
assets should mesh properly with payout patte rns anticipated under the covered plans. 
As respects defined contribution plans, underwriters are most concerned about a heavy concentration 
of assets invested in company stock, discussed earlier in this course. 
Single-Employer versus Multi-Employer Plans 
Additional risks are posed by multi-employer benefit plans compared with those generated by single-
employer programs. (Multi-employer plans are most often set up by manufacturing firms or governmental employers that employ unionized wo rkers within the same industry.) Since multi-
employer plans are usually larger and more complex than single-employer plans, claim frequency and 
claim severity tend to be higher than for single-employ er plans. Of course, this is reflected in higher 
premium rates for multi-employer plans. 
Types of Covered Plans 
The kinds of covered benefit plans have a significant impact on the insurability of a given fiduciary 
liability risk. More specifically, the size of the be nefits promised and the duration over which such 
benefits must be paid, heavily influence the risk of  loss under a fiduciary policy. For instance, there is 
a risk of insolvency associated with a defined benef it pension plan compared to one that is constituted 
on a defined contribution basis. This is because the sponsoring company assumes the financial risk 
under a defined benefit pension plan, while in contra st, this risk is shifted entirely to the plan's 
participants under a defined contribution progr am. However, as already discussed, defined 
contribution plans are not also without significant risks. 
Legal Counsel's Opinion 
Underwriters must also rely on the opinions of a plan's attorney to evaluate the extent of its 
compliance with ERISA law. It is not uncommon for a given plan to fail one or more compliance tests, given the number and complexity of ERISA rules and regulations. Thus, a "clean" opinion from the plan's law firm is critical. Chapter 5—Underwriting Fiduciary Liability Insurance 
37 CPA Firm’s Opinion 
Periodic, comprehensive ERISA audits, normally con ducted by CPA firms with particular expertise 
in such matters, can also substa ntially reduce an insure’s exposure to claims. Accordingly, some 
underwriters will grant premium credits to in sureds that will submit to audits.   
Profile of Covered Fiduciaries 
As is the case with directors and officers liab ility insurance, underwriters seek to insure only 
reputable fiduciaries. Accordingly, underwriters evaluate the integrity, experience, and knowledge of 
both the insured fiduciaries as well as the outside services providers they have hired to administer the applicable benefit programs. 
Loss Control Program 
The extent to which an organization adopts the kinds of measures described above, will reduce its 
likely exposure to claims, and is yet another important underwriting factor. Companies that 
implement such approaches will generally receive favorable underwriter consideration, from both a 
premium, as well as a coverage standpoint. 
 
Chapter 5 Review Questions  
1. Pricing fiduciary liability insurance is : 
a. Based on many insurers’ pooled loss experience. 
b. Done by a rating bureau. 
c. Entirely objective, based on statistical data. 
d. Inconsistent among insurers, each of whom might use a different approach. 
2. It seems to be hard to find an insurer willing to underwrite fiduciary liability insurance that 
will cover Pyar Square Company’s “Circle-o f-Life” defined benefit retirement plan, which 
has built a strong asset base thanks to its investme nt portfolio that consists primarily of two 
very different asset types: (1) Pyar Square’s own stock, and (2) high-interest (“junk”) bonds. 
Underwriters’ reluctance is probably b ased on all of the following factors, except: 
a. Extensive use of “speculative” investments. 
b. Lack of diversification.  
c. Level of risk. 
d. Misleading plan name. 
 
    
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
38 3. The exposures of defined benefit plans and defi ned contribution plans depend, in part, on the 
entity that assumes the plan’s fi nancial risk, which is the: 
a. Investment management company charged with the duty with investing plan assets. 
b. Participants with a defined benefit pens ion plan and the sponsor with a defined 
contribution program.  
c. Sponsor with a defined benefit pension pl an and the participants with a defined 
contribution program. 
d. Sponsor with both defined benefit and defined contribution programs. 
 
 
    
 
    
 
     
 
 
Answers to Chapter 5 Review Questions 
1. d. Each company must develop its own rating approach. 
2. d. The plan’s name is normally not an important underwriting criterion. Even though retirement plans 
essentially apply only to the end of an employee’s lif e cycle, “Circle of Life” does not seem to create 
unrealistic expectations of a type that would lead to a lawsuit. Other characteristics of this plan are 
much more problematic. 
3. c. The sponsoring company assumes the financial risk under a defined benefit pension plan, while in 
contrast, this risk is shifted entirely to the plan's  participants under a defined contribution program.  
39 Chapter 6 
Fiduciary Liability Loss Control 
Chapter 6 provides methods of reducing exposur es to liability claims against fiduciaries. 
Controlling Fiduciary Liability Losses 
The following techniques can assist persons who have fiduciary responsibilities in reducing the 
exposure to claims against them. These techniques ar e summarized in Exhibit 6.1 and discussed in the 
pages that follow. 
 
EXHIBIT 6.1 
FIDUCIARY LIABILITY LOSS CONTROL MEASURES  
• Conduct periodic, independent ERISA compliance audits  
• Use "experts" to design benefit plans  
• Fund plans adequately  
• Invest plan assets prudently  
• Avoid conflicts of interest  
• Avoid prohibited transactions  
• Report and disclose plan information as required  
• Select and evaluate fiduciaries carefully  
Conduct Periodic Audits 
Insureds should have periodic a udits conducted by independent orga nizations, in an effort to assure 
compliance with ERISA regulations. (These should be in addition to regular audits by certified public 
accounting (CPA) firms.) Although significant costs are associated with such procedures (e.g., fees 
and management time to assist auditors), consulta tion with persons conversant in the complexities of 
ERISA can lower the incidence of claims against fiduciaries. A routine audit should be done each 
year and a comprehensive audit performed every 5 years. (Routine audits concentrate on a plan’s 
compliance with ERISA procedures, whereas compre hensive ones do likewise, and, in the case of 
defined benefit plans, perform a detailed analysis of the plan’s assets. For instance, such an audit 
would do an assessment of the specific investments held by a defined benefit pension plan, such as its 
individual bonds.) 
  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
40 Use Experts To Design Plans 
Designing pension and benefit plans requires consid erable, specialized expe rtise. Fiduciaries should 
enlist the assistance of CPAs and actuaries who speciali ze in creating such plans, rather than rely on 
in-house personnel whose background in this area ma y be limited. Many of the problems plaguing 
pension and welfare programs stem from errors or inadequacies in the basic design of the plan.   
Fund Plans Adequately 
Inadequate funding of defined benefit pension plans—and their subsequent inability to pay promised 
benefits—are frequent sources of claims against fi duciaries. Having an independent CPA firm audit 
an insured's plan (which is required by most plan s with 100 or more participants) and employing an 
actuary to certify that the plans are adequately funded will usually prevent the problems associated 
with underfunded plans. This is especially true if such work is performed in the early stages of a 
potential funding inadequacy. 
Invest Prudently 
Many of the difficulties experienced by pension plans are the result of imprudent investments. Often, 
pension monies are invested in too high a proportion of risky alternatives. In other cases, fiduciaries 
fail to diversify adequately. Because fiduciaries ca n be held liable for negligence in selecting and 
supervising outside service providers, use of an experienced, independent investment adviser with a 
strong track record is desirable. Additionally, fiduc iaries should conduct periodic reviews of a plan's 
investment objectives, as well as assess the extent  to which these objectives are being met by the 
outside advisory organization. 
As already noted, one means of providing a layer of insulation from liability for imprudent 
investment decisions is for an insured to retain an adviser who is registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940. This will afford an insure d organization's fiduciaries a valid defense should 
allegations be made that fiduciari es were negligent in selecting an i nvestment adviser. This protection 
arises from the fact that corporate fiduciaries cannot  be held liable for an investment manager's 
imprudent decisions. They can only be found liable fo r negligently selecting the investment manager.   
Avoid Conflicts of Interest 
Just as corporate directors and officers must avoid conflicts of interest in managing the affairs of the 
organization, so too should individuals charged with the responsibility of overseeing pension and 
benefit programs. A high percentage of claims agai nst fiduciaries allege some form of self-dealing, 
and affected individuals should take particular car e when potential conflicts of interest could be 
alleged. (This is particularly true as respects party-in-interest transactions, which were discussed 
earlier in this course.) More specifically, the following practices should be avoided. 
• Selecting investments in which a fiduciary has a personal stake  
• Use of an outside service provider (e.g., actuary, CPA,  legal counsel) who is an associate or a relative of the fiduciary  
• Changes in plans that would accrue substantial be nefit to, or enrich, an individual fiduciary  
The First Union Lawsuits: A Case Study in Conflicts of Interest 
One high-profile example of conflicts of interest were the class action lawsuits brought against First 
Union Corporation in 1997. The la wsuits made two key allegations. Chapter 6—Fiduciary Liability Loss Control 
41 The first allegation was that present and former 401(k) plan participants were given no option but to 
invest their contributions exclusively in mutual f unds managed by First Union. The basis of the plan 
participants' claims is that the performance of th ese mutual funds lagged those of comparable mutual 
funds. The claimants alleged that by increasing the size of these mutual funds, First Union made its mutual funds more attractive to investors, to the de triment of its employees. And even if the funds had 
performed well, the question arises as to whether Fi rst Union's intent was to benefit itself or its 
employees. 
Second, the lawsuits alleged that First Union char ged higher investment management fees to manage 
its own defined contribution plan than it charged to outside clients. Moreover, the First Union defined 
contribution fund was also First Union's investment management group's largest client. Again, even if 
the First Union employees' pension fund performed well, there was an apparent conflict of interest 
inherent in such practices. 
Ultimately, First Union agreed to settle the lawsuits for $25 million. 
Avoid Prohibited Transactions 
Given the intricacy of ERISA, avoiding prohibited transactions is not always a clear-cut process. 
Although some transactions c onstitute obvious violations, othe rs do not and could be easily 
overlooked. Consequently, independe nt outside legal counsel should be sought when gray area 
situations arise. (An example of a prohibited tran saction would be one where a fiduciary of a pension 
plan invests plan monies in a company where he holds a majority interest.)  
Report and Disclose Plan Information as Required 
Passage of ERISA created the need to file myriad reports to federal agencies; in particular, annual 
reports must be provided to the following. 
• The Department of Labor  
• The Internal Revenue Service  
• The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (for pension plans)  
Also, reports may need to be filed with the Soci al Security Administration and made available for 
inspection by plan participants. Finally, special procedures may be needed to complete reports when the following happen. 
• Plan provisions are materially changed  
• A plan is terminated or partially terminated  
• A plan is merged with another or its assets are spun off  
Severe penalties for noncompliance and failure to f ile can result in fines of up to $1,000 per day. 
Consequently, every effort must be made not to run afoul of these regulations, which could increase a 
fiduciary's exposure to liability. 
It should also be mentioned that compliance with  the ERISA report filing requirements is not, by 
itself, a complete defense to a fiduciary liability claim. However, failure to comply with such 
regulations heavily increases the possibilit y that liability will ultimately attach. Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
42 Select and Evaluate Fiduciaries Carefully 
Regardless of any specific loss control actions they may take, the ultimate responsibility for 
controlling the risks associated with pension and bene fit plans rests with the individuals who provide 
services to the insured organization's covered plans. Thus, such persons and firms must be selected on 
the basis of their experience, expertise, and integr ity, rather than for personal or political reasons.

43 Chapter 7 
Coordinating Fiduciary Liability Insurance with Other Coverages 
Chapter 7 explains how to coordinate  fiduciary liability policies with ot her, related types of coverage.  
The manner in which fiduciary liability coverage mu st be coordinated with other types of insurance 
has long been a source of confusion. This discussion examines the potential gaps and overlaps that 
can occur between fiduciary liability and these rela ted coverages and proposes ways to address these 
coordination issues. 
Fiduciary Liability versus Employee Benefits Liability 
Fiduciary liability insurance covers  claims alleging breach of the duties enumerated by ERISA and by 
common or statutory law (i.e., discretionary duties). In contrast, employee benefits liability coverage 
applies to claims involving administrative errors as sociated with employee pension and welfare plans. 
Exhibit 7.1 illustrates several claim scenarios that correspond to the types of claims addressed by a 
policy covering the employee benefits liability exposure.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITY EXPOSURES AND CLAIM TYPES 
Activity Claim Scenario 
Counseling employees 
regarding employee savings plan An employer offers a 401(k) savings plan. The company's employee benefits administrator suggests that  an employee, who seeks capital 
preservation, put his contributions into an aggressive growth stock 
fund. The employer is sued when the fund loses 30 percent of its 
value after a stock market crash. 
Interpreting employee 
benefit programs Based on an employee benefit adminis trator's erroneous calculation 
of an expected monthly pension benefit, an employee elects early 
retirement. The employee sues when his initial monthly check is 
significantly less than the administrator calculated. 
Handling employee 
benefit program 
records Following his divorce, an employee elects to change the beneficiary 
on his life insurance policy from his ex-wife to his son. He advises 
the company's benefits administrator accordingly, but the change is 
never made. Six months later the employee dies, at which time, his son sues because he cannot collect under the policy. 
Enrolling or canceling enrollment in employee benefit plans A company's benefits administrator forgets to enroll a new employee in the firm's major medical plan. The employee sues after the plan denies medical benefits after being diagnosed with cancer. 
 
The ISO Employee Benefits Liability Coverage Endorsement 
In response to the employee benefits exposure, The Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO), has 
developed an endorsement designed for attachment  to commercial general liability (CGL) policies, 
CG 04 35 (10/01), that covers this exposure, a lthough not the exposure to fiduciary liability. 
Employee benefits liability (EBL) coverage is rare ly, if ever, written on a stand-alone basis. In 
addition to the ISO employee benefits liability coverage endorsement, individual insurers offer 
similar endorsements, also as an option availabl e under CGL policies. However, unlike fiduciary 
liability policies, these endorsements are available only as an endorsement to a commercial general liability (CGL) policy but never as a separate policy. 
Is an Employee Benefits Liabilit y Endorsement Worthwhile? 
Despite the coverage it provides, an employee benef its liability endorsement is of little value. There 
are several reasons for this. 
First, any firm having an employee benefits liability  exposure also has a fiduciary liability exposure. 
Therefore, buying only an EBL endorsement under a CGL policy and not purchasing a fiduciary 
liability policy form leaves the organization uncove red for fiduciary liability claims. This is because 
employee benefits liability policies do not cover fiduc iary liability exposures. Moreover, there is little 
or no advantage to buying both an  EBL endorsement and a fiduciary  liability policy (since the latter 
almost always covers the EBL exposure). In fact, buying both a fiduciary liability policy and an EBL 
endorsement creates a situation wh ere duplicate coverage exists.  
Second, as already explained, virtually all fiduciary  liability policies also cover the employee benefits 
liability exposure.  Chapter 7—Coordinating Fiduciary Liability Insurance with Other Coverages 
45 In reality, the only reason for a company to purchase an employee benefits endorsement to a CGL 
policy is if it is unable to obtain fiduciary liabilit y coverage that also covers the firm's employee 
benefits liability exposure. However, given today's market conditions, it will almost always be 
possible to obtain both coverages under a fiduciary liability form. 
Considering this situation, purchasing an EBL endorsement to a CGL policy is rarely necessary. 
Stand-Alone versus Packaged Approaches to Fiduciary Liability Coverage 
In recent years, a packaged a pproach to obtaining fiduciary liability insurance has become 
increasingly popular. Specifically, insurers have begun to offer fiduciary coverage along with 
directors and officers (D&O) and employment practices liability (EPL) policies. Such policies are 
known as management or executive liability packag e policies. (Occasionally, kidnap and ransom 
insurance, also known as "special risk" coverage, is  also made available with in a package, along with 
these other three policies.) 
Advantages of t he Packaged Approach 
A packaged approach features separ ate insuring agreements and separate policy limits for each of the 
coverages provided (i.e., D&O, employment prac tices, fiduciary, kidnap/ra nsom). Accordingly, 
package policies provide essentially the same scope of coverage that is afforded by a stand-alone 
fiduciary liability policy. In additio n, pricing is usually somewhat lower than that found in a stand-
alone fiduciary liability policy. This is becau se there are underwriting economies of scale under these 
circumstances. Specifically, much of the same  information used to underwrite D&O and EPL 
coverage is also required when unde rwriting a fiduciary liability policy. 
Approach to Limits 
Most often, but not always, executive/management liability package policies are written with separate 
limits for each of the individual coverages it provid es. In a minority of cases, these policies contain a 
combined single limit. This can operate as either an advantage or a drawback, depending upon the 
individual claim situation. It can benefit an insu red if, for example, there is an especially large 
fiduciary liability claim, which could exhaust the policy’s entire limit. On the other hand, if, for 
example, there were also another, smaller type of claim sustained under one of the policy’s other 
coverages, this would have the effect of depleti ng limits otherwise available for the larger fiduciary 
claim.  
Limitations of the Packaged Approach 
Despite these advantages, a packag e policy approach to obtaining fiduc iary liability coverage may not 
always be available. In addition, even if a pack aged policy can be purchased, a number of privately-
held organizations sometimes elect not to purchase a D&O policy, given their relatively limited exposure to claims against their directors and officer s. If this is the case, a packaged approach is not 
feasible, so that a stand-alone fiduciary liability policy becomes the onl y available option.

47 Chapter 8 
Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage: Insuring Agreements 
This chapter describes the major in suring agreements found within fiduciary liability insurance policy 
forms.  
As was pointed out in Chapter 2, the fiduciary lia bility exposure actually existed prior to the passage 
of ERISA. ERISA merely formalized the law associ ated with the administration of employee pension 
and welfare plans. It also broadened the scope of su ch liability so that it became a “personal” rather 
than simply a “corporate” liability. This means that under ERISA, the personal assets of a fiduciary 
can be confiscated to restore any losses suffered by a covered plan if the losses were caused by the 
fiduciary’s negligence. (In that sense, fiduciary liab ility coverage functions in a manner similar to that 
of D&O liability insurance, because fiduciary liabilit y coverage also protects the personal assets of 
those persons who serve as fiduciaries, just as D&O liability coverage protects the personal assets of those who serve on boards of directors.)  Soon afte r the passage of ERISA, along with the substantial 
increase in exposure that it fueled, fiduciary liab ility insurance first appeared and immediately 
became an essential part of all corporate insurance portfolios. 
Insuring Agreements 
There are two insuring agreements found within fi duciary liability policy forms. The first covers 
“fiduciary liability,” and the second covers “settleme nt programs,” also sometimes referred to as 
voluntary compliance programs. In addition, the polic ies provide vicarious liability coverage for the 
acts of third-parties for which the covere d fiduciaries are legally responsible.   
Fiduciary Liability Coverage 
The coverage provided under the policies’ fiduciary liability insuring agreement applies to liability in 
conjunction with:  
a. fiduciary (i.e., discretionary) duties,  
b. administrative (i.e., nondiscretionary) duties, and  
c. claims made against the fiduciaries simply as a matter of their legal status as fiduciaries (regardless of whether such liability is  the result of their specific acts).  
Coverage for Fiduciary Duties 
The covered acts/covered services provisions under th e policies state that coverage applies to 
breaches of duties by the insureds w ith respect to plans that are: (1) subject to ERISA and (2) not Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
48 subject to ERISA. Liability under both types of plan s results from errors in discretionary functions 
(e.g., failure to select a competent pension fund mana ger), as opposed to errors that are considered to 
be ministerial or administrative duties (e.g., inad vertent failure to enroll a new employee in the 
company's 401(k) savings program). In effect, not all of the duties performed by fiduciaries fall 
within the scope of the ERISA law. 
Coverage for Administration (Employ ee Benefits Liability Coverage) 
In addition to covering fiduciary liability exposures (above), the policies also apply to liability for 
acts that involve purely administrative errors a nd omissions associated with managing pension and 
benefit plans. Examples of administrative errors were noted in Chapter 2 and include such acts as failure to enroll an employee in a company health plan or stating an incorrect pension amount when 
questioned by an employee as to what she can expect to receive as a monthly benefit upon retirement. 
Coverage for Liability Based on Status as a Fiduciary  
The policies also cover fiduciaries based solely on their status as covered fiduciaries under the policy. 
Such a provision is important because in some clai m situations, all “fiduciaries” (including persons 
who did not actively participate in causing a claim) ar e named in a lawsuit, despite the fact that the 
lawsuit does not allege specific acts of negligence or breaches of fiduciary duties by one or more of 
these fiduciaries.  
Consider the following example. In a lawsuit, Fiduc iary “A” is alleged to have committed a wrongful 
act in conjunction with an employee benefit plan . In addition, Fiduciaries “B,” “C,” and “D” are 
named in the lawsuit, even though there is no specifi c wrongful act alleged against “B,” “C,” or “D.” 
Rather, they are named in the suit simply because they are also fiduciaries under the same benefit 
plans as Fiduciary “A.” Again, this approach to coverage is similar to what is found with in D&O liability insurance policies. 
That is, in addition to covering specifically alle ged wrongful acts, coverage under D&O forms also 
applies to directors and officers based solely on thei r status as directors and officers of the corporate 
organization—even if a lawsuit does not indicate that one or more such individuals committed any 
wrongful acts or were negligent in performing their required duties. 
Settlement Programs 
“Settlement Programs” are programs operated by various government organizations for the purpose of resolving disputes regarding pe nsion and benefit plans. For example, rather than litigate a claim 
against one or more fiduciaries, an employee who brings a claim involving a benefit plan and a defendant corporate organization that offers the be nefit plan, can voluntarily agree to a settle the 
claim alleging a wrongful act by the defendant. (This approach is similar to arbitration or mediation, 
as set forth in commercial general liab ility and property insurance policies.) 
Settlement programs avoid the time and expense of formal litigation and are administered by federal 
agencies such as the IRS and the United States Depa rtment of Labor. Most often, the policies are 
written with either (1) a sublimit that applies only to claims involving settlement programs (and 
actually creates an additional amount of coverage) or (2) a provision stating that a specific amount 
(generally $100,000) applies to claims conclude d under settlement programs and any payments made 
under this coverage reduce the policy’s aggregate limit.  Chapter 8—Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage: Insu ring Agreements 
49 To be eligible to receive coverage under this insu ring agreement, the insured must first notify the 
insurer of the fact that a dispute is being submitted to a voluntary settlement. In other words, the 
insurer must have prior notice of the settlement. 
Liability for Acts of Third Parties 
Fiduciary liability policies also typically cover “an y person for whose Wrongful Acts the Insureds are 
legally responsible.” Such coverage is critical becau se under ERISA, a fiduciary can be held liable for 
the acts, errors, or omissions of those persons or entities that provide services to employee benefit plans, as was discussed in Chapter 2.  
As a matter of common practice, fiduciaries frequently  delegate a number of duties to organizations 
and individuals who are outside of their own company. For example, the design and management of a 
firm’s pension and welfare plans of ten require a corporation to hire a number of outside entities such 
as actuaries, consultants, and investment manage rs. Should any of these entities commit errors or 
omissions that cause a loss to the beneficiaries of the covered plans, or act in contravention of ERISA, 
the fiduciary sponsoring the plan can be held lia ble for the acts of such parties. Consequently, 
fiduciary liability policies also cover the cor poration sponsoring the be nefit programs and the 
individual fiduciaries’ liability for the acts, errors , and omissions of such third-party/outside service 
providers. 
Coverage Applies for Vicarious Liability Only 
It should be emphasized, however, that coverage fo r such liability is vicarious, not direct. Thus, 
outside organizations working with the insured organizations are not insureds under the policy. 
Rather, the policies cover only the sponsor organi zation’s vicarious liability for the acts of these 
outside entities.  
For example, if both the insured organization and an outside organization are sued in conjunction 
with an alleged wrongful act, coverage under the in sured organization’s fiduciary liability policy does 
not apply to the outside organization directly. Ra ther, the insured organization’s fiduciary liability 
coverage will only respond if the outside organiza tion is unable to assume financial responsibility for 
its own acts or omissions.  
Given this situation, orga nizations that hire third-party service providers to assist in administering 
their employee benefit plans should carefully check such entities’ professional liability insurance 
coverage before commencing a bus iness relationship with them. 
Coverage for Multi-Employer/Employee Stock Ownership Plans 
Most fiduciary liability insurance policies are desi gned to cover the legal lia bility exposures generated 
by so-called “single-employer” employee benefit programs. Accordingly, the wording in such 
policies indicates that the definition of a “sponsored plan” (automatically covered by the policy) does 
not include either a multi-employer plan or an employee stock ownership plan, except by 
endorsement. When coverage for these types of pl ans is required, additional premium is almost 
always required. The rationale for such an approach is that both types of plans are more prone to claims, compared to other kinds of employee benefit programs.  
Multi-employer plans (typically found within unionized  industries) tend to be larger, more complex 
and, because they involve other corporations, are more difficult for any single-employer corporation 
to control and manage.  
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
50 Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) are al so more loss-susceptible. These plans grant 
significant amounts of shares of stock in the cor poration to its employees. However, since these 
investments are concentrated within a single compan y, they tend to be more volatile than equity 
investments in, for example, a broad range of cor porations. Consequently, ESOPs are more subject to 
claims, compared to employee savings programs (such as 401(k) plans) that invest in the shares of a 
number of companies (an approach that adds  diversification and thus lowers risk).

Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage: Covered Persons/Covered Organizations 
This chapter discusses the persons and organizations  covered by fiduciary liability insurance policy 
forms. 
The persons and organizations covere d by fiduciary liability policies normally fall into four distinct 
categories. Specifically, the policies cover: 
1. The assets of the named insured organization  
2. The assets of the benefit plans scheduled in the policy  
3. The personal assets of the individuals serving as fiduciaries of the insured's firm  
4. The personal assets of any additiona l persons named on the policy  
Again, as noted earlier in this discussion, and for the reasons noted, coverage for multi-employer 
plans applies only by endorsement. 
Omnibus “Insured” Wording 
To assure that no plans, persons, or organi zations are omitted from coverage, the following 
broadening endorsement should be added to the “insur ed” definition in an insured’s fiduciary liability 
policy. 
... and any employee welfare or pension benefit plans maintained or administered by any 
insured or sponsor organization and its subs idiaries as now exist or may hereafter be 
constituted, acquired or formed. 
Wording of this type will reduce the potential for ove rlooking any individuals, plans, or organizations 
that are intended to be covered under a fiduciary liability policy. 
Such wording is rarely found w ithin the language of standard fiduciary liability policy forms. 
However, insurers will sometimes be willing to add it by means of a manuscript endorsement, 
although they do not generally charge additional premium to do so.  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
52 Important Coverage Extensions 
In addition to the entities and persons noted above, most fiduciary liability policies extend coverage 
to (1) spouses of insureds and (2) personal re presentatives of insureds, such as trustees.  
Spousal Coverage 
Spousal coverage is necessary because plaintiffs’ a ttorneys often attempt to assert claims against the 
assets of the spouse of a covered fiduciary when fiduciaries attempt to transfer their assets to a 
spouse.  
Most, but not all versions of the spousal coverage extension also include “domestic partners” within 
their definitions of “spouse.” This is importan t, because such living arrangements are becoming 
increasingly prevalent.  
Coverage of Legal Representatives 
Claims against fiduciaries are personal in nature. Thus , such claims survive the death, bankruptcy, or 
incapacity of an insured fiduciary. As a result, c overage is required if, for example, a trustee in 
bankruptcy, executor, or guardian must “stand in th e shoes” of an insured fiduciary in defending a 
claim against him/her. Accordingly, coverage unde r the policies applies to such persons, as well. 
No Coverage for Direct Acts of Insured Legal Representatives 
 It should be noted, however, that extensions c overing legal representatives and spouses do not apply 
to alleged wrongdoing by an insured’s legal represen tative or spouse. Rather, coverage applies only in 
the event that a claim is made against the assets held or controlled by a legal representative or spouse. 
 
Chapter 9 Review Question  
1. A fiduciary liability policy should not extend coverage to encompass the : 
a. Domestic partner of a covered fiduciary. 
b. Executor of a covered fiduciary’s estate. 
c. Spouse of a covered fiduciary. 
d. Wrongdoing of a covered fiduc iary’s legal representative. 
  
    
Answer to Chapter 9 Review Question 
1. d. Coverage applies only in the event a claim is made against the assets held or controlled by a legal 
representative.   
53 Chapter 10 
Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage: Coverage for “Status Changes” of Covered Organizations and Plans 
This chapter will explain how fiduciary liability in surance applies when covered organizations and 
covered plans undergo various types of “status changes.” 
Coverage for Acquisition of New Benefit Plans 
The policies provide automatic coverage of additional pension and benefit plans over which insured 
fiduciaries obtain control, typically, when they acqui re other companies. For example, if Company A 
acquires Company B and, as a result, becomes trustee of Company B’s pension and benefit plans, Company A’s policy will cover acts associated with the management and administration of B’s plans, 
beginning on the date such plans were acquired.  
Automatic coverage means (1) coverage immediately applies to the newly acquired plans, even 
without notification to the insurer and (2) such coverage applies without  payment of additional 
premium. When automatic coverage does not apply,  the insurer requires notification of the acquired 
plan(s), which are then subject to the standard  underwriting process, norma lly requiring additional 
premium. 
Limitations on Coverage of Newly-Acquired Plans 
However, insurers place various limits on the actual extent of the coverage they will provide. Three 
key points should be kept in mind. 
Automatic Coverage Applies Only If A ssets of Acquired Firm Are “Limited”  
First, the policies state that insurers will automati cally extend coverage only in situations where the 
total assets of the company being acquired do not exceed  a specific threshold percentage, relative to 
those held by the acquiring company. This threshold generally ranges from 10 to 25 percent, depending on the particular insurer’s form. For instance, assume a company with assets of $100 million acquires another company whose assets are $25 million. If the asset threshold of the acquiring company’s fiduciary liability policy is 25 percent, automatic coverage would ap ply. However, if this 
threshold were only 10 percent, automatic cove rage would not apply. Thus, as this example 
illustrates, from the insured’s standpoint, the higher the threshold specified in a policy, the better.  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
54 The intent behind the granting of automatic coverage is that the addition of such plans, given their 
relatively small size compared to the parent company (as measured by the asset test), will not 
substantially increase the underwriter’s exposure to loss.  
Coverage Is Not Automatic When the Asset Threshold Is Exceeded 
Second, when the acquired entity’s assets exceed th e threshold percentage stated in the policy, 
automatic coverage does not apply immediately. Rather, coverage for the newly-acquired entity’s plans must be underwritten separately, and add itional premium will usually be charged.  
Coverage Applies Only to Acts Following Acquisition 
Third, coverage for claims associated with acquired plans (whether obtained on an automatic basis or on the basis of separate negotiation), applies only to those claims that were caused by acts taking 
place after the acquisition.  
For example, assume Company A acquires Compan y B on January 1, 2010. There would be no 
coverage if it were alleged that the fiduciari es of Company B committed a wrongful act before 
January 1, 2010. This is despite the fact that the claim was made against B after January 1, 2010, the 
date on which when coverage for ac quired plans would have been in place. In effect, when plans are 
newly-added via acquisition, it is not the underwriter’s  intent to grant what would constitute prior acts 
coverage.  However, under certain circumstances, coverage for such prior acts can be obtained, although 
additional premium will almost always be required by  the underwriter. Details on this action will be 
provided later in this course.  
Coverage for Other Types of “Status” Changes 
There are four other common types of “status ch anges” relevant to th e coverage provided under 
fiduciary liability policies. These include the following.  
• Takeover of the insured and its plan(s)  
• Cessation of a subsidiary  
• Termination of a plan operated by the named insured  
• Newly created plans  
Takeover of Insured and Its Plans 
When an insured company is acquired by another company, its benefit plan(s) is/are usually 
incorporated within the acquiring company’s exis ting plans. Under these circumstances, the acquired 
company’s fiduciary coverage continues until th e end of the acquired company’s policy term. 
However, coverage applies only for wrongful acts that took place prior to the acquisition date. No 
coverage applies to wrongful acts that take place after the acquisition date.  
For example, assume Company A has a fiduciary liab ility policy with a January 1, 2010 to January 1, 
2011 term. On July 1, 2010, Company A is acquire d by Company B. According to the terms of the 
acquisition agreement, Company A’s benefit plans are incorporated into  Company B’s plans. 
Coverage under Company A’s policy continues until January 1, 2011. However, Company A has no coverage for wrongful acts under its previous polic y that took place after July 1, 2010—the date it 
was acquired.  Chapter 10—Fiduciary Liability Insura nce Coverage: Cove rage for “Status 
Changes” of Covered Organizations and Plans 
55 If, for example, one of the trustees of A’s pension plan was accused of embezzling from the plan prior 
to July 1, 2010, coverage would apply under  A’s policy, provided the claim was made on or before  
January 1, 2011, the termination date of A's policy. 
Conversely, if the alleged embezzlement took place after  July 1, 2010, no coverage would apply 
under A's policy, regardless of the fact that the claim was made against A prior to the expiration of its 
policy on January 1, 2011. 
The rationale behind this provision is that once the entity has been acquired, coverage for wrongful 
acts that took place after the acquisition date will be covered by the acquiring company’s fiduciary 
liability policy. And since coverage will apply to acts that took place prior to the acquisition under the 
acquired company’s policy, in theory, there should be no coverage gaps.  
Cessation of a Subsidiary (and Its Plans) 
Often, the subsidiary of a company will be “s pun off,” meaning that another entity acquires the 
subsidiary, or, as frequently  happens, the subsidiary will be purch ased from the parent company by its 
operating managers. Under these circumstances, the question arises as to how coverage applies to the 
now former subsidiary’s plans. The general rule is that coverage applies under the former parent 
company’s fiduciary liability policy for any acts that  (1) took place prior to the spin-off and (2) are 
made against the insured prior to the expiration of  the parent’s current fiduciary liability policy. 
Conversely, coverage will apply under the new ow ners’ policy for any acts that took place after the 
date the subsidiary was acquired/spun off. 
Consider the following illustration. On July 1, 2010,  a subsidiary of the XYZ Corporation is spun-off 
when it is purchased by its operating managers. Th e XYZ Corporation has a fiduciary liability policy 
in place with a January 1, 2010–11 term. In this situation, coverage will apply under XYZ’s fiduciary 
liability policy to any acts associated with the subsidiary’s benefit plan s that took place prior to July 
1, 2010, provided the claim associated with those act s is made before the expiration of XYZ policy on 
January 1, 2011. Coverage for acts that took place after the July 1, 2010 acquisition date will be 
covered under the fiduciary liability policy purchased  by the operating managers that bought the 
subsidiary, even if the claim is made prior to the expiration of XYZ’s policy on January 1, 2011. 
Termination of a Plan Operated by an Insured 
If, during the term of a fiduciary liability policy,  an insured terminates a benefit plan, coverage 
applies to acts associated with the plan, provided these acts took place prior to policy expiration. For 
example, assume an insured is covered by a fiduc iary liability policy with a January 1, 2010 to 
January 1, 2011 term. One of the insured’s benef it plans is terminated on July 1, 2010. Coverage 
applies to acts associated with the terminated plan, provided these acts took place prior to January 1, 
2011 and the claim associated with such acts is also made against th e insured prior to the expiration 
of the policy on January 1, 2011.  
Coverage When a Subsidiary Is “Spun Off”  versus Coverage for When a Plan Is 
Terminated 
There is a subtle but important difference in how coverage applies when a subsidiary is “spun off” 
compared to how coverage applies when a plan is terminated. In the later in stance, coverage applies 
to claims made in conjunction with wrongful acts that take place up until the policy expires, provided 
the claim is made against the insured prior to polic y expiration. In the former case, coverage applies 
to claims made in conjunction with wrongful act s that take place prior to the date on which the Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
56 subsidiary is spun off, provided the claim is ma de against the insured prior to policy expiration. 
Following are two examples illustrating this distinction.  
• Subsidiary Spin-Off.  The applicable policy is written w ith a January 1, 2012–13 term. The 
subsidiary is spun off on July 1, 2012. Covera ge applies if (1) the wrongful act causing the 
claim took place prior to July 1, 2012 and (2) th e claim is made against the insured prior to 
January 1, 2013. 
• Plan Termination.  The applicable policy is written w ith a January 1, 2012–13 term. The 
plan is terminated on July 1, 2012. Coverage applies if (1) the wrongful act causing the claim 
took place prior to January 1, 2013 and (2) the claim is made against the insured prior to 
January 1, 2013. 
The rationale for this difference is that when a subs idiary is spun off, the former parent company no 
longer has any control over the organization’s operati ons—including its benefit programs. In contrast, 
when a plan is terminated, the parent company ma intains such control. Accordingly, coverage still 
applies to acts that take place after a plan is disc ontinued. In contrast, coverage ceases for any acts 
that take place after a subsidiary is spun-off. 
 
Chapter 10 Review Questions  
1. When McCane and Pailing join forces, McCa ne will assume responsibility for Pailing’s 
benefit plan. McCane’s plan currently has $100 million in assets, while Pailing’s has $25 
million. Because McCane’s fiduciary liability policy has a 10 percent threshold, the Pailing plan: 
a. Will automatically be covered for acts occu rring before the date of the acquisition. 
b. Will automatically be covered immediately with no additional premium. 
c. Will automatically be covered immediately su bject to an additional premium at audit. 
d. Will be underwritten separately, and an additional premium will probably apply. 
2. Spinning Wheel Company and its subsidiary, Bobbin Company, are covered by a 1-year fiduciary liability policy effective January 1 of th e current calendar year. On July 1, Bobbin’s 
operating managers purchase Bobbin from the parent company and also purchase separate insurance. On September 5 of this year, a claim is made by Bobbin employees for an act that occurred earlier this year on February 14. Assuming the claim is within the scope of coverage, this claim is: 
a. Covered by Spinning Wheel’s policy. 
b. Covered by Bobbin’s policy.  
c. Not covered by Spinning Wheel’s policy because Bobbin is now a separate entity. 
d. Not covered by Spinning Wheel’s policy becau se the act occurred before the acquisition.

59 Chapter 11 
Key Definitions in Fiduciary Liability Policies 
This chapter explains how fiduciary liability polic y forms define the following key terms: covered 
losses, claims, territory, defense cost s, and claim settlement procedures. 
Covered Losses 
Fiduciary liability policies cover indemnity payments (i.e., compensatory awards and settlement 
costs), and defense expenses, that result from clai ms made against insureds (such as pre- and post-
judgment interest.)  In addition, the policies cove r supplementary expenses associated with litigation, 
including bonds and appeal costs.  
Voluntary Compliance Fees 
The policies also cover Voluntary Compliance Fees, which are payments made to correct 
“deficiencies” in benefit program s operated by the insured organi zation. (Deficiencies refer to 
amounts by which defined benefit plans ar e underfunded.) The Employee Plans Compliance 
Resolution System (EPCRS), operated under the ausp ices of the Department of Labor,  provides an 
administrative process for arriving at such  settlements. This process is advantageous because it eliminates the high legal costs associated with the formal litigation process. Note, however, that 
fiduciary liability policies do not cover funding defi ciencies. Rather, they cover the administrative 
fees associated with arriving at voluntary settlements under the EPCRS process.  
Certain or Limited Fines, Civil Penalties, Taxes, Unin surable Matters, Benefits 
Payable under Plans 
On the other hand, fines, civil penalties, taxes, any matter deemed uninsurable by law, and actual 
benefits payable under the insured plans, are excl uded by most policies’ definitions of “loss.” 
However, some of the policies do cover (subject  to sublimits) fines and penalties levied in 
conjunction with the Health Insu rance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The rationale for 
affording such coverage is that the HIP AA law falls within the scope of ERISA. 
Punitive Damages 
Nearly all fiduciary insurers cover punitive damag es, that is, damages that intend to punish the 
wrongdoer, rather than compensate the person or organization suffering the loss. (Note, however, not 
all states permit insurance coverage  of punitive damage awards.) Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
60 Definition of "Claim" 
The manner in which the policies define the term "claim" is an important coverage issue. The 
broadest possible definition is ideal because it tends  to accelerate the trigger of coverage under a 
fiduciary liability policy form, whic h is usually advantageous from the insured’s standpoint. Although 
the exact definition of “claim” varies from policy to  policy, the following are events that trigger a 
claim under the typical fiduciary liability form. 
Written Demand for Monetary  or Nonmonetary Relief 
Under nearly all fiduciary liability policies, a writte n, rather than an oral, demand is required to 
trigger coverage. Such demands can seek either money damages or nonmonetary relief (e.g., a cease 
and desist order). 
Civil Proceeding Commenced by the Service of a Complaint 
A civil proceeding commenced by th e service of a complaint is actually a type of written demand for 
monetary or nonmonetary relief. 
Criminal Proceeding Commenced by Filing of Charges 
Coverage is also triggered under a fiduciary liability policy by a criminal indictment. This is 
important because at times, corporate fiduciaries are indicted for criminal offenses, prior to the time 
in which civil complaints are filed against them. For example, the trustee of a pension plan could be indicted for embezzlement before being sued in civil court.  
The policies exclude coverage for damages alleged in conjunction with criminal acts. However, the 
policies state that defense coverage is provided wh en an insured is criminally charged, and that 
defense coverage continues until “final adjudica tion,” meaning the point at which the insured 
fiduciary is acquitted, convicted, or the claim is settled.  
Formal Administrative or Regulatory Proceeding 
Administrative or regulatory agencies frequently file  complaints against corporate fiduciaries. In 
addition, the Department of Labor and the PBGC sometimes request investigations into various 
benefit programs, such as when a pension plan appears to be seriously underfunded. Thus, it is 
important for coverage to be triggered by such actions.  
Arbitration, Mediation,  or Alternative Dispute Resolution Proceeding 
Under the terms of most fiduciary liability policies,  when an insured is requested to appear at an 
arbitration hearing, coverage is au tomatically triggered. This is bene ficial because pension and benefit 
plan-related disputes are increasingly being addressed by the arbitration process, rather than through 
the traditional court system.  
Written Request To Toll/Waive a Statute of  Limitations Relating to a Potential 
Civil or Administrative Proceeding 
A written request to waive or toll (i.e., suspend) a statute of limitations generally involves a situation 
when a government agency or a cl aimant suspects wrongdoing on the part of a fiduciary but requires 
additional investigatory time to determine the exact  nature of such potential wrongdoing—prior to 
filing a claim. Often, the agency or claimant even tually does file a formal claim against the insured Chapter 11—Key Definitions in  Fiduciary Liability Policies 
61 fiduciary(ies). Thus, when an insured is notified of  such requests, coverage is triggered under most 
policy forms.  
Covered Territory 
Nearly all fiduciary liability policies provide coverage  on a worldwide basis. That is, coverage applies 
regardless of where the wrongful act that gave rise to a claim took place or where the claim is 
brought. Such a provision is important, especially fo r a company that has even the smallest degree of 
international operations.  
Covered Defense Costs 
In addition to covering indemnity payments (i.e., se ttlements and judgments asso ciated with claims), 
fiduciary liability policies also cove r the costs required to investigate, defend, and settle claims. These 
items typically encompass attorneys’  fees, adjusters' services, court costs, bonds, and related expenses 
required by the claim settlement process. 
Defense within Policy Limits 
Under virtually all the insurers’ forms, payment of defense costs reduces the policy’s limit of liability.  
However, a handful of insurers, especially those insuring smaller organizations, will sometimes offer 
the option to cover defense in addition to polic y limits, in return for additional premium.  
Duty To Defend Provisions 
The phrase “duty to defend” in a fiduciary liability po licy states that the insurer has the duty to defend 
any claim alleging a covered act under the policy. In contrast, the phrase “duty to pay” or “non-duty to defend” in a policy states that the insurer does not  have the duty to defend claims; rather, it is the 
duty of the insured to defend claims. Such forms onl y compel the insurer to pay the defense costs in 
connection with the insured’s execu ting the defense of the claims. 
Virtually all fiduciary liability forms contain word ing to the effect that the insurer has a duty to 
defend. For all but the largest, most legally experienced and sophisticated corporations that have large internal legal staffs, duty to defe nd provisions eliminate the burden of  having to secure appropriate 
legal counsel and to manage the claim defense pro cess. Since most firms lack both the knowledge and 
legal talent available to deal with such claims, requiring the insurer to select counsel and control the 
defense process actually confers a benefit and also protects the insured organization.  
“All” Allegations Defense: A Key Benefit of Duty To Defend Forms 
Another significant benefit for insureds of duty to  defend policies is that under these forms, the 
insurer is obligated to defend all the allegations in a lawsuit, as long as at least one such allegation is 
covered by the policy.  
 The following scenario illustrates this point. A newly-hired employee properly filled out the 
enrollment form for coverage under the company’s medical insurance plan, but the human resources 
assistant misplaced the application and never mailed it to the insurance company. As a result, the 
employee had no insurance coverage when he w as diagnosed with cancer 1 month later. The 
employee complained so bitterly and so frequently upon learning he had no coverage, that the 
company terminated him. The now ex-employee then  filed suit for damages relating to the error in 
administering the company’s health care plan and for lost wages resulting from wrongful termination. Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
62 Although damages arising from the first allegation— the error in administering employee benefits—is 
clearly covered by standard fiduciary liability pol icy forms, the wrongful termination claim is not. 
However, since coverage exists fo r the first allegation, an insurer, under a “duty to defend” policy, 
must also defend the wrongful termination claim (although it would not be liable for any potential 
damages). In contrast, under a fiduciary liability policy written on a “non-duty to defend” basis, the 
insurer would only be obligated to defend (and pay) the claim associated  with the first allegation, but 
would have no obligation to defe nd the wrongful termination claim. 
Drawbacks of Duty To Defend Provisions 
The major drawback of duty to defend provisions is  that they could cause the insured to lose control 
in defending a claim. This is because duty to defend provisions could give an insurer the right to settle 
a claim in a situation where the insured was determined to contest it. However, there are instances 
where, as a matter of principle, an organization w ould prefer to block a settlement, and yet, duty to 
defend provisions could be used to de ny the organization this opportunity. 
Often, the preference for duty to defend provisions is a function of an organization’s economic position; insureds with substantial resources sometimes prefer to control their own defense and are 
fully capable of managing major litigation. In contr ast, smaller organizations are usually less capable 
of managing the defense of a claim and, therefor e, generally prefer duty to defend provisions. 
Claim Settlement Procedures 
At times, there are disagreements between the insu rer and the insured as to an appropriate settlement 
amount in a claim situation. As a result, the po licies are written with what are known as co-insurance 
“hammer clauses” to assist in resolving such disag reements. Such clauses clearly benefit insureds. 
These provisions provide for a sharing of any settlement or judgment that is larger than the settlement 
amount the insurer wanted the insured to accept, plus  a sharing of additional defense costs incurred in 
continuing to contest the claim, following the in sured’s refusal to settle the claim on the basis 
recommended by the insurer.  
Coinsurance Hammer Clause: An Illustration 
Assume an insurer wanted to settle a claim for $100,000 but the insured refused to consent. Also 
assume that the fiduciary liability policy contains a 50 percent coinsurance hammer clause. The claim 
is eventually settled for $200,000 and $50,000 in additiona l defense costs are also incurred following 
the insured's refusal to consent. Under these cond itions, the insurer would pa y a total of $175,000, 
broken down as follows. 
• $100,000, the originally recommended settlement amount, plus 
• $50,000, which is 50 percent of the amount by which the $200,000 final settlement figure 
exceeded the insurer’s origin al $100,000 settlement recommendation (i.e., 50 percent of 
$200,000  – $100,000), plus 
• $25,000, the amount of additional defense costs e xpended following the insured’s refusal to 
settle on the basis initially recommended by th e insurer (i.e., 50 percent of $50,000). 
Adding these figures yields a $175,000 total insurer payment. 
In contrast, under a typical “hammer clause” without  a coinsurance provision, the insurer would not 
have paid any of the $100,000 a dditional settlement or $50,000 in ad ditional defense costs, following 
the insured's refusal to settle the claim on  the basis suggested by the insurer.  Chapter 11—Key Definitions in  Fiduciary Liability Policies

64 Answers to Chapter 11 Review Questions 
1. c. Fines, civil penalties, taxes, any matter deemed  uninsurable by law, and actual benefits payable 
under the insured plans, are excluded by most policies' definitions of "loss." The policy is designed 
primarily to cover indemnity payments and defense costs. 
2. b. Fiduciary liability policies provide defense cove rage when an insured is criminally charged. 
3. d. In addition to covering indemnity payments (i.e., settlements and judgments associated with 
claims), fiduciary liability policies cover the costs re quired to investigate, defend, and settle claims. 
4. b. With a settlement above the original figure, the insurer pays the originally recommended settlement 
amount plus 50 percent of the excess judgment plus 50 percent of the excess defense costs.

Fiduciary Liability Coverage: Limits and Deductibles/Retentions Provisions 
This chapter examines the limits and deductibles/retentions provisions found within fiduciary liability 
policies. 
Policy Limits 
The interrelated claims provision is central to the application of policy limits under fiduciary liability 
policies.  
Interrelated Claims Provisions 
Interrelated claims provisions state that if a series of claims results from a single wrongful act or a 
series of related wrongful acts, errors, or omissions  and these claims are made during more than one 
policy period, the applicable limit of coverage is th e one that was in effect at the time the first claim 
was made.  
Application of the Inte rrelated Claims Provision 
Assume that in 2010, Company A’s pension plan is merged with Company B’s plan, after Company 
A is acquired by Company B. The trustees of A’s plan are later sued because the benefits under B’s 
plan are lower than under Company A’s plan. Also  assume that three different fiduciary liability 
policies were in force during these years, each with a $5 million limit. Three different beneficiaries make claims in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.  
Under an interrelated claims provision, the $5 m illion policy limit applying in 2011 represents the 
total limit available to pay and defend all three clai ms—regardless of the fact that claims were also 
made against the fiduciaries during the 2012 and 2013 policy years. 
Purpose of the Interrelated Claims Provision 
The purpose of interrelated claims provisions is to pr event a “pyramiding” or “stacking” of limits in 
which policy limits from more than 1 year are app lied to a single wrongful act or series of related 
wrongful acts. In the absence of such a provision: 
• the insurer's $5 million policy limit applicable during 2011 would have applied to the first 
claim;  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
66 • the insurer's $5 million policy limits applicable  during 2012 would have applied to the second 
claim; and  
• the insurer's $5 million limit applicable during 2013 would have applied to the third claim.  
Thus, despite the fact that all three claims arose from a single act—the merger of the two companies’ 
pension plans—in the absence of the interrelated claims provision, the insurer would have been 
responsible for paying as much as $5 million under each  of three policies, or a total of $15 million. 
Interrelated claims provisions are especially importa nt in fiduciary liability policies because claims 
involving essentially the same wrongful act are often filed by multiple claimants during different 
policy terms. 
Deductibles/Retentions 
Most fiduciary liability policies include clauses in th eir deductible/retention provisions stating that the 
policy deductible/retention applies per wrongful act ra ther than to each separ ate claim. For example, 
in the scenario noted previously, illustrating application of interrelated claims provisions, only one deductible/retention would apply because all three of the claims arose from a single wrongful act.   
 The “batch clause” (another term for a per wrongful act deductible/retention) is especially important 
in fiduciary liability insurance becau se, if there were no such provision, the application of a separate 
deductible/retention to each claimant would dramatic ally reduce the extent of coverage provided by 
the policy, given the fact that many claims agains t fiduciaries are filed as class actions, which always 
involve multiple plaintiffs. 
Application of Deductibles/Rete ntions to Defense Coverage 
Fiduciary liability de ductible/retention clauses normally state th at the deductible/retention applies to 
both indemnity payments and defense costs, regardle ss of whether an indemnity payment is made. In 
effect, the forms do not provide “first-dollar” defense coverage.  
To illustrate, assume that an insurer expends $50, 000 to defend a fiduciary but is not ultimately 
required to pay a judgment or settlement on the fiduciary’s behalf because the claim is dismissed on a 
summary judgment basis. If the policy contains a $50,000 deductible/retention, the insurer would seek reimbursement from the insured in the amount of $50,000 to satisfy the policy’s deductible/retention provision,  regardless of the fact that no indemnity payments were made on the 
insured’s behalf. Alternatively, if, in this scenario , in addition to expending $50,000 in defense costs, 
the insured settled the claim for $200,000, the $50, 000 deductible would still apply and the insurer 
would pay $200,000 (with the insured absorbing the $50,000 deductible).   
First-Dollar Defense Coverage 
However, some fiduciary liability policies contain provisions that affirmatively cover defense costs on a first-dollar basis if they are incurred (1) by an individual fiduciary who is not reimbursed for 
such costs by the corporation sponsoring the employee benefit plan in question or (2) when defense 
costs are incurred in conjunction with voluntary compliance settlement programs.

1. For 4 consecutive years, the trustees of Rusty Company’s pension plan repeat the same error 
and fail to fully fund the 401(k) plans of pa rticipants who intend to make the maximum 
permitted contribution.  The e rror is discovered during Year 4, but retroactive plan 
contributions are not permitted, so affected pa rticipants must pay back taxes. Participants 
make claims against the plan during Years 4 and 5, alleging wrongful acts occurred during 
Years 1 through 4. Different insurance limits applied to Rusty Trustees’ insurance policies each year, but the limit that applies to this claim is the limit for: 
a. Year 1 since that was when the first wrongful act occurred. 
b. Year 4 since that was when the first claim was made. 
c. The sum of all limits in force from Year 1 through Year 4. 
d. The sum of all limits in force from Year 1 through Year 5.

Answers to Chapter 12 Review Questions 
1. b. The applicable limit is the one that was in effect at the time the first claim is made. 
2. d. In this claim, the indemnity payment is $150,000 plus $25,000 was expended in defense, for a total 
of $175,000. The insured must then reimburse the insurer for the $50,000 deductible. This results in a 
net payment of $125,000 by the insurer ($175,000 - $50,000= $125,000). Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage

Fiduciary Liability Policy Conditions  
This chapter discusses several policy conditions that are especially important in fiduciary liability 
policies. 
The conditions sections of fiduciary liability insura nce policies significantly affect the insureds’ rights 
under the policies. Conditions that are particularly  important (and are discussed below) in fiduciary 
liability policies include the following. 
• Subrogation/recourse  
• Severability of interests provisions  
• Managed care exception wording  
Subrogation/Recourse 
One unusual aspect of the subrogation provisions wi thin fiduciary liability policies is that, unless 
specified, underwriters ordinarily have what is known as the right of recourse, i.e., the right to 
subrogate against an insured. (Subr ogation is the assignment, to an insurer, by terms of the policy or 
by law, after payment of a loss, of the rights of the insured to recover the amount of the loss from one 
legally liable for it. Thus, under a subrogation provision, an insurer could have the right to collect the amount of its payment to a beneficiary under a pension plan, from the fiduciary whose negligence 
caused the beneficiary to suffer a loss.) Such a pr ocedure represents a distinct departure from the 
approach used in most other types of professiona l liability insurance, wherein subrogation against 
insureds is typically barred by policy language.  
When Is Subrogation Permitted Against Fiduciaries? 
Section 410(b)(1) of ERISA allows an insurer to pursue subrogation against a covered fiduciary, if the premium for a fiduciary policy is paid out of plan assets. The logic unde rlying this provision is 
that fiduciaries should not be financially absolved  from the consequences of their wrongful acts when 
premiums for liability coverage are being paid  from the assets of the benefit plans they are 
administering—to the detriment of the beneficiaries of those plans.  
Subrogation/Recourse: An Example 
A group of corporate fiduciaries is sued becau se they hired an incompetent actuary whose 
recommendations produced a woefully underfunded pension plan. Premiums for the corporation's fiduciary liability policy were  paid out of the pension plan's assets.  In this instance, the insurer has the 
right to subrogate (known as the right of recourse) against the insured corporate fiduciaries.  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
70 The rationale for allowing subrogation (which, as noted above, is unusual un der professional liability 
policy forms) is that since coverage for the fi duciary liability policy is being paid for from the 
beneficiaries' assets (i.e., the pension fund), the fi duciaries should not have the benefit of insurance 
coverage under these circumstances and that, as a result, the insurer has a right to be reimbursed for 
paying the loss, from the fiduciaries who caused the loss.  
Not allowing the insurer to subrogate against the fiduciaries in this example would be like barring a 
medical insurer from subrogating against a negligent driver who injures a pedestrian covered by the 
insurer's major medical policy. In this example, it would be unfair for the negligent driver to escape 
financial responsibility to the pedestrian, because th e pedestrian had purchased medical coverage and, 
as a result, received compensation for the medical expenses incurred in the accident. 
Why Subrogation/Recourse Is Rarely Pursued Against Fiduciaries 
It should be recognized, however, that in actual practice, subrogation/recourse is rarely pursued 
against fiduciaries. This is because nearly all cor porate organizations pay fi duciary liability premiums 
as a corporate expense (rather than from benefit plan  assets). As a result, the fiduciaries are not, in 
effect, using the benefit plan beneficiaries' assets to provide liability coverage for themselves. Rather, 
they are using their own assets (or, in this instance,  the corporation's assets, on whose behalf they are 
administering the benefit plans), to protect themselves from liability claims made against them.  
“Waiver of Recourse” Provisions 
Given the foregoing, nearly all fiduciary liability policies’ recourse/subrogation provisions state that 
the insurer will “waive its right of recourse” agai nst insured fiduciaries in the event that policy 
premiums are paid from corporate proceeds—rather than from benefit plan assets—which is almost 
always the case. 
Severability 
Provisions that enforce the concept of severability of  coverage are included in virtually all fiduciary 
liability policies. These clauses state that coverage applies separately to each insured under the policy. 
There are three significant implications of such clauses: 
• Actions of one insured do not void coverage as to other insureds. 
• False application statements by one insured do not bar coverage as to other insureds. 
• Policy limits do not increase based on the number of insured fiduciaries. 
These three concepts are discussed below. 
Actions of One Insured Do Not Void Coverage as to Other Insureds 
First, severability provisions indicate that if the ac tions of one (or more) insured(s) voids coverage 
under the policy, such coverage is not invalidated as respects other individuals insured by the policy. This type of severability provision is also contained within certain exclusions found in fiduciary liability policies, typically in the dishonesty and pe rsonal profit exclusions, which are discussed later 
in this chapter, while in other policies, nonimputation provisions are found in sections apart from the 
exclusions. 
For example, assume that one fiduciary commits an act that would be subject to the policy's 
dishonesty exclusion (e.g., a plan trustee profits when , in return for a kickback, he allows his brother-
in-law to manage the assets of a covered plan). Fu rther, assume that as a result of this action, all Chapter 13—Fiduciary Liability Policy Conditions 
71 fiduciaries insured by the policy are named in a lawsuit. In this situation, the severability provision of 
the policy will provide defense coverage for the ot her "innocent" fiduciaries—despite the fact that no 
coverage would be available to  the culpable individual.  
Severability provisions are also sometimes referr ed to as nonimputation clauses, meaning that the 
wrongful act of one insured (which bars coverage for that person) will not be "imputed" to another 
person, so as to bar coverage for the innocent insured(s).  
False Application Statements Do Not Void Coverage as to Other Insureds 
The second common situation in which severability provisions apply is when one (or more)  individual(s) intentionally provides false information on an application for fiduciary coverage. In a claim situation involving the false statement, th e severability provision voids coverage only for the 
specific insured person(s) who provided such fal se information. Consequently, the policy would 
cover those insureds who were not aware of and we re not a party to the false statement made on the 
application.  
Consider the following example. The president of an  insured corporation, who also served as a trustee 
of the firm's benefit programs, signed an applica tion for fiduciary coverage which he knew vastly 
overstated the assets of the company’s defined bene fit pension plans, while understating its future 
liabilities. If all the company’s fiduciaries are later su ed in connection with that plan, coverage would 
only be voided as to the president who signed the app lication, but coverage would be available as to 
the other fiduciaries who were not aware of the fa lse data to which the president had attested.  
Policy Limits Do Not Increase Based on the Number of Insured Fiduciaries 
The third effect of severability provisions is to clarify the fact that although coverage can apply 
separately to individual fiduciaries, severability does not increase the policy's basic limit of liability.  Under a fiduciary liability policy containing a $10 million annual aggregate limit, a maximum of $10 
million would be available to defend and pay on behalf of all insu red fiduciaries during the policy 
term. This $10 million limit would apply and not  increase—regardless of how many individual 
fiduciaries were actually named in a single lawsuit. 
The first two types of severability provisions discu ssed above are beneficial to insureds while the 
third protects the insurer.  
Managed Care Coverage Exception Wording 
Although fiduciary liability policies exclude cove rage for bodily injury, property damage, and 
personal injury, in recent years insurers have begun to attach, via endorsement, an important 
exception to this exclusion. By means of so-calle d “managed care coverage exception endorsements,” 
fiduciary liability insurers except—and therefore c over—bodily injury, sickness, mental or emotional 
distress, disease, or death when such events r esult from the administration of managed care health 
plans. In view of the fact that such plans are subj ect to ERISA, this is appropriate and, of course, 
represents a substantial exposure to employers sponsoring such plans. 
    Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
72 When the Managed Care Exception Endorsement Applies 
The two most common claim scen arios associated with the managed care exposures involve an 
injured employee-claimant suing an employer s ponsor of a managed health care plan, alleging: 
1. That the employer-sponsor of a managed health care plan negligently selected the managed 
health care plan provider; or  
2. that the employer-sponsor of a managed health  care plan wrongly denied or delayed medical 
benefits provided by the plan.  
In the first scenario, an employee could allege that  a physician's malpractice in treating a medical 
condition caused bodily injury and that the employer  was negligent in selecting a managed care plan 
that included an incompetent physician with in its roster of health care providers.  
An example of the second scenario might involve an employee who is denied an organ transplant and 
dies as a result of the denial. The employee's estate co uld allege that either the employer and/or the 
managed care organization wrongly denied medical tr eatment that was covered by the terms of the 
managed care plan. 
Why the Managed Care Exception Endorsement Is Necessary 
Absent a managed care endorsement that “excepts” bodily injury when it arises from managed care 
plan administration, coverage would be excluded for the scenarios noted ab ove, because as already 
mentioned, fiduciary liability policies exclude cove rage for bodily injury.  However, this exception 
wording is both appropriate and necessary since such plans are indeed subject to ERISA and therefore 
significantly expose the fiduciaries to personal liability , when they are responsible for administering 
such plans.  
Coverage Subject to a Sublimit 
One important aspect of managed care coverage endor sements is that they are normally subject to a 
sublimit, most often $1 million. Insurers usua lly impose a sublimit, because the exposure to large 
losses is substantial. Absent a sublimit, insurers would, in some instances, be required to charge a premium approaching that of the fiduciary liability policy limit itself.

1. Judas, one of the twelve Trustees of Benefit Plan , also serves as its treasurer. In exchange for 
thirty shares of stock in a silver mine, Judas leaks confidential insider information concerning 
the fund’s investment strategy that operates to the detriment of plan participants. Other 
fiduciaries are not involved in Judas’s actions a nd learn of them only later. Subsequently, all 
twelve trustees and the plan itself are named as defendants in a lawsuit resulting from this 
incident. The severability provisions of Benefit Plan’s fiduciary liability policy indicate that: 
a. Judas’s betrayal does not preclude coverage for other fiduciaries. 
b. Judas’s betrayal voids coverage for all fiduciaries. 
c. only Benefit Plan, not individual fiduciaries, is covered for this claim. 
d. only Judas is covered for this claim. Chapter 13—Fiduciary Liability Policy Conditions

75 Chapter 14 
Fiduciary Liability Policy Exclusions  
Exclusions contained in a fiduciary liability policy can have a significant effect on the scope of 
coverage it provides and are the subject of this chapter.  
Policy exclusions provide a meaningful basis for comparing two fiduciary liability policies. In 
situations where a decision is to be made rega rding which one of two or more policies should be 
selected, the presence or absence of certain exclusionary  language—or variation in the breadth of that 
exclusion—between two insurers, may serve as a key to selecting one policy over another.  The following exclusions will be discussed in this chapter: 
• Dishonesty 
• Personal profit 
• Contractual liability 
• Failure to collect contributions (owed to an employee benefit plan) 
• Claims from a subsidiary prior to acquisition 
• Failure to fund in accordance with ERISA 
• Failure to purchase or maintain insurance or bonds 
• Workers compensation, unemployment insura nce, Social Security disability benefits 
• Discrimination not related to ERISA law 
• Benefits payable to a beneficiary 
• Bodily injury and property damage liability 
• Exposures excluded by other professional liability policies  
Dishonesty 
Insuring fiduciaries for the individual liability that arises out of their intentional commission of illegal 
acts is not permitted as a matter of public policy a nd therefore excluded. (Public policy refers to 
attempts by the law, to discourage certain types of conduct. Accordingly, if insurance coverage were 
available for intentional, wrongful acts, such c onduct would actually be encouraged, something that 
would be undesirable for society as a whole.) However, nearly all fiduciary liability policies qualify the exclusion by stating that the exclusion applies only if a "judgment" or "final adjudication" establishes that the insured committe d the intentionally dishonest act. Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
76 In addition, since an insurer's duty to defend is ge nerally construed as being broader than its duty to 
indemnify, insurers typically provide defense covera ge to allegations of fraud or criminal acts, until 
such dishonest acts are actually prov en by means of a criminal conviction or an adverse judgment.  
The Practical Effect of the Dishonesty Exclusion 
In actual practice, a settlement is reached between the claimant and the insurer in the vast majority of 
cases when claims allege dishonest conduct. With in the settlement agreement, the insured rarely 
makes an admission of liability and the insurer then simply pays the settlement amount on the 
insured's behalf. Consequently, the practical effect  of the dishonesty exclusion is practically nil, 
because the exclusion is not usually enforced to deny  coverage for either defense costs or indemnity 
payments. 
Personal Profit 
Liability of fiduciaries who attain personal profit or  financial advantage to which they were not 
legally entitled is another exposur e considered to be uninsurable and therefore excluded (e.g., a 
trustee of a pension plan receives a portion of a broke r's commission in return for investing the plan's 
funds with the broker's company). However, most  fiduciary liability policies do not apply this 
exclusion unless the claim of personal profit is factua lly established. Therefore, it is important for an 
insured to ascertain that the polic y purchased does contain such exception language and to negotiate 
with underwriters for its inclusion in the event that it does not.  
Severability Provisions in Fiduci ary Liability Policy Exclusions 
As already explained, by virtue of what are known as severability provisions, for the purpose of applying fiduciary liability policy exclusions, the ac tions of one insured fiduciary will not be imputed 
to any other insured fiduciary. For example, assume that a claim alleges dishonest acts were committed by a group of pension plan trustees. If only one of these individuals was, in fact, proven guilty of the dishonesty, based upon the severability provision applying to the policy's exclusions, the 
non-culpable plan trustees would still have defense co verage available for them, despite the fact that 
all fiduciary liability policies contain exclusions for dishonest acts. Such coverage is available 
because the policy's severability provision states that the dishonest acts of the culpable insured will 
not be imputed to the innocent insureds, so as to bar coverage for these individuals. Severability provisions are also sometimes referred to as nonimput ation clauses, which, as already noted in this 
discussion, are sometimes found in sections of the policy that are outside of the exclusions section.  
Insurers typically include severability provisions with respect to the fraud/dishonesty and personal 
profit exclusions. 
Contractual Liability 
Nearly all fiduciary liability policies exclude covera ge for situations where an insured has held a 
third-party service provider harmless in conjunction with the operation of a pension or benefit plan. 
(There are two exceptions to this and they  are discussed later in this chapter.)  
The following scenario provides an example of how  a fiduciary might be required to hold a third-
party service provider harmless, in conjunction with an employee benefit plan. A CPA firm requests 
that an insured fiduciary hold the accounting firm harmless if the firm is sued in connection with auditing services it performs for the plan. Also assume  that the accounting firm certifies the plan's 
financial statements have been prepared acco rding to generally accepted accounting principles Chapter 14—Fiduciary Liability Policy Exclusions 
77 (GAAP) and fairly represent the plan's true financial condition. Six months later, the plan is declared 
insolvent by the PBGC. The benefici aries sue the CPA firm, which, in turn, seeks to be held harmless 
by the trustee of the plan. Given the contractual liability exclusion, no coverage would apply to hold 
the accounting firm harmless; that is, cover its defense costs and make indemnity payments on its 
behalf.  
Rationale for the Exclusion 
Contractual liability exclusions eliminate coverage for hold harmless agreements in situations such as 
in the above example, for two reasons. First, out side service providers should rightfully maintain 
professional liability coverage of their own and therefore not require clients to hold them harmless when they provide professional services. Second, insurers are averse to assuming liability for hold 
harmless agreements unless they can underwrite them at the inception of a policy—in which case 
some insurers may agree to modify the policy's contractual liability exclusion for a specific hold 
harmless agreement. 
Avoid Holding Other Parties Harmless 
As a general rule, it is a sound practice for a fiduc iary to avoid holding outside parties harmless for 
services that outside parties render in conjunction w ith the fiduciary’s benefit and pension plans. 
However, if an insured fiduciary must hold anothe r entity harmless, the underwriter should be advised 
prior to policy inception. This allows the insurer time to evaluate the nature of the exposure and 
assess an appropriate additional premium if the underw riter is willing to cover such an agreement. 
Exception Wording 
Within the contractual liability exclusion, there is  an exception that does provide coverage for two 
types of hold harmless agreements: (1) an agreemen t to assume liability that would have applied even 
in the absence of a contract and (2) an agreement in a trust agreement or in other documents establishing a corporate benefit plan, to assume  liability for another party’s negligence. 
Liability That Would Have Applied in the Absence of a Contract 
It is common for contractual liability exclusions to be worded so they provide an exception (and 
thereby provide coverage) for liability that would ha ve attached even in the absence of a contract. 
Assume that a contract with a pension actuary re quired an insured corporation to indemnify and hold 
harmless the actuary for claims resulting from the insured's sole negligence.  Also assume that the 
insured corporate trustee provided the actuary with e rroneous data regarding its  pension plan, and that 
as a result, the pension actuary committed an error.  Under these conditions, even in the absence of an 
agreement to hold the actuary harmless, the cor poration would still be re quired to indemnify the 
actuary for any claims made against the actuary. Th is is because such claims would have been the 
result of the trustee's negligence (not the actuary's).  In this instance, the policy would therefore cover 
the corporation's assumption of liability, because such liability (i.e., for the corporation's sole negligence) would apply even if the insured corpor ation never agreed to hold the actuary harmless. 
Liability Assumed in B enefit Plan Documents 
If, according to the documents governing an insured be nefit plan, an insured fiduciary is required to 
hold a benefit plan service provider, such as an investment manager, accountant, or attorney, harmless (even if a claim results from the service provider's negligence), most fiduciary liability policies 
contain exception wording stating that coverage a pplies under these circumstances (i.e., benefit plan Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
78 governing documents.). Underwriters are willing to cover hold harmless agre ements of this type 
because such requirements are stated in plan doc uments, which insurers presumably have had an 
opportunity to review during the underwr iting process, prior to binding coverage. 
Failure to Collect Contributions Ow ed to an Employee Benefit Plan 
The majority of, but not all, fiduciary liability policies exclude coverage for claims caused by a 
fiduciary's failure to collect contributions owed to a pension or benefit plan. This exposure typically 
arises in multi-employer, union-sponsored plans, but not in single-employer plans.  
Rationale for the Exclusion 
This exclusion appears in fiduciary liability po licies because the collecting of pension and benefit 
plan contributions from companies participating in  a multiemployer plan is an activity that is 
completely within an insured's control. Accordingly, insurers exclude this exposure because they do 
not intend to provide what would, in eff ect, serve as "financial guarantee insurance."  
However, many of the forms do provide key excep tion wording under two circumstances. A handful 
of forms afford defense coverage to allegations that the insured(s) failed to collect contributions owed to a benefit plan. In addition, a handful of insurers provide coverage if it is  alleged that failure to 
collect contributions was the result of the insured's ne gligence, rather than the result of an intentional 
act. The rationale for this exception to the exclus ion is that an insurer will cover an insured's 
unintentional failure to make such collections, but no t the deliberate failure to do so. For example, if 
this exception wording were found in a policy, c overage would apply (to the resulting $250,000 
shortfall) if an insured thought it needed to collect $500,000 in annual premiums from its employees 
to fund its self-insured medical plan, when it actually needed to collect $750,000 in a given year. 
Claims from a Subsidiary Prior to Acquisition 
The policies routinely exclude coverage for claims associated with a subsidiary that were the result of wrongful acts taking place prior to the date on which the insured corporation acquired the subsidiary. As was noted in Chapter 10 under “Coverage for Other Types of Status Changes,” claims against 
fiduciaries frequently result from such circumstances.  
Rationale for the Exclusion 
The rationale for this exclusion is that the underwrite r did not insure the subsidiary at the time of the 
wrongful act and, thus, should not be responsible  for covering claims associated with such acts. 
This exclusion is necessary because, absent such wording, claims from a subsidiary's pre-acquisition 
wrongful acts would otherwise be covered. Specifically, if such a claim were made against the insured during the term of the policy and the wrongful act took place on or after the policy's 
retroactive date, the insurer would not be able to deny liability for it. Although such claims can be 
precluded by manuscript exclusionary endorsements , these endorsements could become difficult for 
an underwriter to manage, especially in the case of  an insured that frequently acquires other 
companies. Accordingly, this "blanket" excl usion accomplishes what a number of individual 
manuscript endorsements would ot herwise be required to do.  
 
  Chapter 14—Fiduciary Liability Policy Exclusions 
79 Failure To Fund in Accordance with ERISA 
Exclusions for claims alleging failure to fund in  accordance with the ERISA law are contained in 
most fiduciary policies. The rationale for the excl usion is that covering losses would be contrary to 
public policy since, under such conditions, the insu rer would be providing c overage for intentional 
violations of federal law (although providing defense coverage to a llegations of legal violations 
would not be contrary to public policy). Accordingl y, many of the forms do provide defense coverage 
to allegations that the insured(s) failed to fund in accordance with ERISA. 
Failure To Purchase or Maintain Insurance or Bonds 
As noted earlier in this course, ERISA requires th at employee dishonesty coverage be arranged to 
protect the assets of an insured organization's pens ion and welfare plans. Claims arising from the 
insured's failure to purchase such coverage are uninsurable because avoidance of claims arising from 
this failure is within the insured's control.  
Workers Compensation, Unemployme nt Insurance, and Social 
Security Disability Benefits 
Nearly all fiduciary liability forms preclude cove rage for claims produced by obligations from 
workers compensation, unemployment insurance, a nd disability laws. The rationale for this exclusion 
is that other, more specific insurance is availabl e to cover such liabilities (i.e., workers compensation 
coverage).  
However, some versions of this exclusion prov ide an exception and, therefore, cover claims 
associated with Consolidated Omnibus Budget R econciliation Act (COBRA) plans and claims made 
under the Health Insurance Portability and Account ability Act (HIPAA). Such plans allow employees 
to purchase an extension of their health care insu rance coverage for an 18-month period following the 
end of their employment with an organization. The rationale for this exception is that separate 
insurance is not available to cover these exposures. 
Discrimination Not Related to ERISA Law 
A number of the policies contain an exclusion for clai ms alleging discrimination that is not related to 
the ERISA law. The rationale for this exclusion is that fiduciary liability policies are not intended to 
cover the types of discrimination typically addressed  by employment practices liability policy forms, 
including discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age,  or national origin under laws such as the Equal 
Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employ ment Act (ADEA) of 1967, the Americans With 
Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1992, and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. 
Exception and Coverage for Discrimination under Benefit-Related Laws 
On the other hand, this exclusion would not preclude  coverage if, for example, a claimant were to 
allege that he or she was discriminated against as respects the availability of or eligibility to receive 
benefits under an employee benef it plan covered by a fiduciary liability policy. As explained earlier 
in this course, section 510 of ERISA prevents employers from taking actions that might abridge or 
prevent an employee from collecting benefits or taking punitive action against a participant for 
exercising his or her rights under an employee benefit plan. Accordingly, such claims are "excepted" 
by this exclusion and therefore covered by fiduciary liability policies. Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
80 Benefits Payable to a Beneficiary 
Most fiduciary liability policies preclude coverage for payment of benefits owed to a claimant unless 
such benefits represent a personal obligation of an  insured fiduciary and such claim results from a 
specific wrongful act. For example, assume an em ployee's beneficiary is unable to collect a death 
benefit under a company's term life insurance program because the insurer that provided such coverage is insolvent. The fiduc iary liability policy will not pay such benefit unless it can be shown 
that one or more of the individual fiduciaries comm itted a wrongful act that caused the survivor to be 
unable to collect the benefit due. If it could be demonstrated that the fiduciary(ies) knowingly 
purchased the life insurance from a financially unsound insurer, and that soon after the purchase, the insurer was declared insolvent, the fiduciary liab ility policy would provide coverage for the benefit 
due.  
Rationale for the Exclusion 
The purpose of this exclusion is to prevent the fiduciary liability insurer from becoming a financial guarantor of benefits due under an insured corporation's benefit programs. Rather, coverage for 
benefits due will only apply when a wrongful act is committed by one or more of the insured fiduciaries and this specific wrongful act prevented the employee or dependent from collecting a benefit that was due him or her (such as in the example above).  
Bodily Injury and Property Damage 
As noted earlier in this section in the discussi on of managed care exception wording, fiduciary 
liability policy forms exclude coverage for bodily injury and property damage. However, as also 
explained, the forms except, and therefore cover, bodily injury and property damages claims when 
they result from the management or administrati on of managed health care plans. The two most 
common allegations associated with such plans are that (1) the administrators of the plan were 
negligent in including an incompetent professional with in its network of medical providers or that (2) 
the administrators of the plan wrongfully denied (o r delayed) treatment that was covered by the plan 
and that as a result of delay/denial of treatment , bodily injury or property damage resulted.  
Other than in cases such as these,  the policies preclude coverage for bodily injury and property 
damage. 
Exposures Excluded by Other Ty pes of Professional Liability 
Policies 
In addition to the exclusions al ready discussed that are particular to fiduciary liability insurance 
policies, a number of exclusions pertain to e xposures also excluded by other types of professional 
liability policy forms. These are noted in Exhibit 14.1 and discussed further in other courses within this series.

1. As the primary administrator for her firm’s  pension plan, Bea Sting allegedly committed 
illegal acts. If a claim based on this allegation shou ld be made against Bea, the strict terms of 
the policy provide that the sponsor’s fiduciary liability insurer would: 
a. Defend Bea until dishonest acts are proven by a criminal conviction or an adverse 
judgment. 
b. Defend Bea until dishonest acts are proven by a criminal conviction or an adverse judgment and then pay any damages awarded on her behalf. 
c. Deny coverage to Bea because the allegation involves dishonesty, which is not covered. 
d. Deny coverage to Bea despite the lack of an applicable exclusion, because the alleged 
acts are contrary to public policy. 
2. Nearly all fiduciary liability policies _________ _ coverage for most situations where an 
insured has held a third-party service provider harmless in connection with the operation of a pension or benefit plan. 
a. endorse 
b. exclude  
c. limit

3. Tonka Motors abruptly discharged a number of office employees in order to shave expenses. 
Mary, one of the discharged employees, had been responsible for collecting benefit plan 
contributions from the firm’s subsidiaries. It  took 6 months before anybody noticed that 
nobody had taken over Mary’s responsibilities. If a claim alleges that Tonka Motors was 
negligent in failing to collect these contributions: 
a. Coverage will be denied, because all fiduciary liability policies have a failure to collect 
contributions exclusion. 
b. Coverage will be denied because the act of collecting contributions is clearly within the 
control of the insured.  
c. Coverage will be denied because the failur e resulted from negligence rather than an 
intentional act. 
d. Some insurers’ fiduciary liability policies will provide coverage because the failure 
resulted from unintentional negligence. 
 
    Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
82 4. Some fiduciary liability claims allege a failure to fund a plan in accordance with ERISA law. 
Many fiduciary liability policies:  
a. Provide both defense and indemnity coverage for these claims. 
b. Provide defense coverage against unproven allegations but exclude coverage for 
intentional violations. 
c. Provide neither defense nor inde mnity coverage for these claims. 
d. Treat these claims the same as other claims unless a court finds payment to be contrary to public policy. 
5. Soon after her late husband’s unfortunate fall from a cliff, Miley Coyote files a claim against 
the fiduciaries of his employee benefit plans.  The husband’s employee handbook states that 
the company provides accidental death insuran ce under which an employee’s beneficiary is 
entitled to receive accidental death insurance be nefits equal to three times his annual salary. 
The employer purchased accidental death covera ge, but the insurer is now insolvent. Most 
fiduciary liability policies preclude  coverage for Miley’s claim against the employer’s 
fiduciaries:  
a. Because the fiduciaries lack any contractual relationship with Miley that would support a 
claim based on a statement in her late husband’s employee handbook. 
b. Because the fiduciary liability policy covers  only claims made directly against the 
insolvent insurer. 
c. Unless the claim results from a specific wr ongful act such as knowing the insurer was 
financially unsound. 
d. Unless the fiduciary liability insurer is al so a financial guarantor of the insured 
employer’s benefit programs.

83 Chapter 15 
Fiduciary Liability Policy Coverage Triggers  
This chapter will address the essential features of claims-made coverage triggers as they appear 
within fiduciary liability policies. Virtually a ll the major insurers' policy forms are written on a 
claims-made basis.   
Operation of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
To be covered under a claims-made policy, a claim must be:  
1. first made  against an insured during the policy period,  
2. result from a wrongful act that took place on or after the policy's retroactive date , and   
3. be reported to the insurer , prior to the expiration of the policy (or within 30 to 60 days 
following expiration).  
The italicized terms will be explained in the pages that follow. 
Operation of a claims-made coverage tr igger is illustrated in Exhibit 15.1. 
     
 
     
 
 Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage

Policy Period: 1/1/11–1/1/12

------x------------------x------------------x-----------------x------------------x-----------------x-------- 
In this example, coverage applies because: (1) the claim was first made against the insured 
during the 1/1/11–12 policy period, (2) the wrongful act that caused the claim took place after the policy's 1/1/10 retroactive date,  and (3) the claim was reported to the insurer prior to policy 
expiration. Had the wrongful act taken place prior to the policy's 1/1/10 retroactive date, coverage would not have applied. Similarly, t here would have been no coverage, had the claim 
been made against the insured prior to 1/1/11 or after 1/1/12. 
The Significance of "First Made" Language 
Use of the term "first made" is significant because it indicates that coverage will apply only when the 
claim has not already been made in conjunction w ith: (1) a previous policy written by the current 
insurer or (2) made under a policy written by a diffe rent insurer, covering the insured prior to the 
current insurer.  
Claims-Made and Reported Policies 
Under a minority of fiduciary policies, coverage a pplies only if the claim is both first made against 
the insured and reported to the insurer during the policy period. This is know n as a "claims-made and 
reported" policy. For example, under such a polic y with a January 1, 2010–11 term, no coverage 
would apply unless a claim was both made against the insured during the pol icy period and also 
reported to the insurer prior to January 1, 2011.  
Claims-Made Policies and Reported Policies with Post-Policy Reporting "Windows"  
In contrast, a majority of forms provide what are known as post-policy claim reporting "windows," 
under which claims made against the insured during the policy period can be reported to the insurer 
for either 30 or 60 days (depending upon the insurer) after expiration of the policy.  
Fiduciary liability forms containing post-policy repor ting "windows" are preferable to claims-made 
and reported policies not containing post-polic y reporting windows. This is because some 
circumstances could render it impossible for an insure d to report a claim made late in a policy period. 
For example, if a summons is delivered to an insu red pension trustee's office late in the day that a 
policy expires, the insured may be unable to notify the insurer within the policy period. This may be 
especially true if he or she is not in the office that day or if the summons were served late in the day at 
the start of a long, holiday weekend, as a result of which the insurer's office had closed earlier than 
usual. Under such circumstances, a claims-made po licy that contains a 30- or, preferably for the 
insured, a 60-day post-policy reporting window is adva ntageous for the insured compared to a claims-Chapter 15—Fiduciary Liability  Policy Covera ge Triggers 
85 made and reported policy, because it allows an insure d to report a claim to the insurer after the term 
of coverage has expired.  
Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates in fiduciary liability policies stat e that for coverage to apply, the wrongful act 
giving rise to a claim must have taken place on or after the retroactive date. Thus, retroactive dates 
preclude coverage for claims stemming from acts th at took place prior to a policy's retroactive date. 
Purposes of Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates have the effect of excluding coverage for possible wrongful acts committed in 
conjunction with some known event (i.e., known to the insured) that took place prior to policy inception. They also preclude coverage for wrongful acts that transpired in the distant past—even if 
unknown to the insured. 
Retroactive dates are generally included in fiduciary liability policies for organizations that are 
buying coverage for the first time. This is because underwriters are reluctant to offer "full prior acts 
coverage" (i.e., policies without retroactive dates) und er such circumstances. Th eir concern is that the 
insured's sudden desire to obtain a policy may have been prompted by the need to obtain coverage for 
circumstances they suspect could produce a claim in the future. For example, if a company began 
offering a full program of employee benefits on January 1, 2000, but did not seek to buy fiduciary 
liability coverage until January 1, 2010, an underw riter could have the impression that the company 
expects a claim to be made against it shortly, since it operated these plans for 10 years without 
purchasing fiduciary liability coverage. 
"Full Prior Acts": Coverage without a Retroactive Date 
However, for a firm that already has a fiduciar y liability policy in place with another insurer, 
inclusion of a retroactive date should be resisted  unless there is a specific underwriting reason, such 
as a complete change in the company's pension a nd benefit programs. By eliminating a retroactive 
date, a policy will provide what is known as "full prio r acts coverage" for all acts, going back to when 
the company's benefit programs were initiated. 
Retro date should be no later than the insured 's first fiduciary liability policy inception date.  
Ideally, an insured will have a policy written with full prior acts coverage. But at the very least, an 
insured should always require an insurer to offer a policy with a retroactive date that coincides with 
the date on which it first began buying fiduciary liab ility coverage (known as "prior acts" coverage), 
even if that date precedes the date on which its current insurer first began writing coverage. If an insured's retroactive date does not coincide with the date on which it first began buying coverage, a 
coverage gap will result since there will be no coverage for wrongful acts that took place between the inception date of the insured's first fiduciary liab ility policy it purchased and the retroactive date of 
the new insurer's policy.  
Always resist retroactive date advancements when replacing coverage.  At times, underwriters 
seek an "advanced" retroactive date when writing co verage for a new account. This has the effect of 
limiting the coverage they are willing to provide to th e start of the period of time this new insurer will 
be on the account. This approach is detrimental for an insured because it provides no coverage for 
acts that took place from the inception date of its first policy to the inception date of the new insurer's 
policy.  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
86 Accordingly, insureds under fiduciary liability polici es and their agents/brokers should always resist 
such advancements, even if additional premium is re quired to achieve "prior acts" coverage. If this is 
not possible, insureds can still purchase extended reporting periods (ERPs) from their current insurer. 
(ERPs are discussed later in this chapter.) Ho wever, as will be noted, there are a number of 
disadvantages inherent in ERPs, including the fact that  they are costly and usually apply for only one 
year. 
Discovery Provisions 
Circumstances often arise under which it is probable that an act, error, or omission will eventually 
cause a claim to be made against insureds under fiduciary liability policies—despite the fact that 
litigation may not be initiated for some time. Accord ingly, virtually all fiduciary liability policies 
provide, by means of what are called "discove ry provisions" (also known as "incident reporting 
provisions" or "notice of potential claim provisions"), that if the insured advises the insurer of "incidents" or "potential claims" during the policy, any actual claims arising out of such "incidents" 
will be considered to have been "made" during that policy period.  
Use of a Discovery Provision: An Example 
For example, the trustee of a corporation's defined benefit plan reveals in a report that the plan is 
seriously underfunded and might not be able to contin ue paying promised benefits in the future. After 
an announcement of this nature, and even before act ual claims have been filed, there is a strong 
possibility that beneficiaries of the plan will eventually initiate legal action against the insured fiduciaries. 
A discovery provision allows the insured to give notice of a potential claim under these and similar 
circumstances. When such notice is  provided to the insurer, coverage for claims arising out of 
reported incidents will apply regardless of how far in  the future actual claims are made. Exhibit 15.2 
illustrates the operation of a discovery provision.  
EXHIBIT 15.2 
HOW A DISCOVERY PROVISION FUNCTIONS  
Policy Term: 1/1/10–11 
Retro Date Incident Insurer 
Notified Policy 
Inception Claim Made Policy 
Termination 
1/1/10 7/1/10 8/1/10 1/1/11 7/1/11 1/1/12 
------x------------------x------------------x-----------------x------------------x-----------------x-------- 
In this example, coverage applies under the 1/1/10–11 policy term because the insurer was 
notified by the insured of an "incident" on 8/1/10. Although the claim associated with the 
incident was not made against the insured until after the 1/1/10–11 policy had expired, 
coverage applies nonetheless because the insure r was notified of the incident under the 
policy's discovery provision during the 1/1/10–11 policy period.  
Catch-22 Aspects of Discovery Provisions: To “Laundry List” or Not 
Despite the benefits they convey, discovery provisi ons are not without drawbacks. On the surface, it 
would appear to benefit an insured to notify his or her insurer of all possible, potential claims prior to Chapter 15—Fiduciary Liability  Policy Covera ge Triggers 
87 policy expiration— a practice known as “laundry listing.” There are, however, four problems that 
may result when an insured e ngages in this practice.  
Higher Premiums in Renewal Policies 
Although a claim may not yet have been made, an unde rwriter will be inclined to provide a somewhat 
higher premium in renewal policies, given the potenti al claim(s) that the underwriter could be called 
on to pay in the future. A safety margin of this kind will increase the cost of an insured’s renewal 
policy(ies). 
Possible Cancellation/Nonrenewal 
Many underwriters believe that “frequency breeds severity.” Therefore, if an insured reports 
numerous incidents, it could indi cate recurring problems associated with the insured’s professional 
practice or corporation which might, at some time, eventually produce a catastrophic loss. Accordingly, if, in the underwriter’s perception,  an insured begins to over-report incidents, the 
underwriter may question the wisdom of continuing to insure him or her—at any premium—and may be inclined to cancel or refuse to renew upon expiration. 
Problems When Changing Insurers 
Reporting numerous incidents under discovery provisions makes it more difficult for the insured to secure replacement coverage should he or she decide  to change insurers. This is because when an 
insured discloses circumstances surrounding possible clai ms to an incumbent insurer, he or she must 
also reveal these circumstances (on the application form) to an insurer who is providing a quotation for a replacement policy. This has two important implications. First, the replacement insurer will not cover claims that may eventually be made in conjun ction with such incidents. Second, if several such 
circumstances are revealed on the application, th e prospective replacement insurer might become 
wary of the insured and decline to provide coverage.  
Possible Admission of Guilt 
If an insured reports an incident to an insurer, and the incident eventually  gives rise to a claim, 
evidence of that report will be discoverable by the claimant’s attorney during the litigation process. While a report of this kind is not necessarily an ad mission of an insured’s culpability, it nevertheless 
provides evidence that the professi onal/executive was concerned about either the level of competence 
with which his or her services were performed or about the outcome produced by the performance of 
those services. Either way, evidence of the report— regardless of whether the insured’s conduct was 
not negligent and/or entirely justified under the circumstances—will make it more difficult to defend 
the insured against a claim.   
It is, however, always a good approach for insureds  to report all relevant information concerning an 
incident, especially any details that would absolve,  or at least mitigate the professional’s potential 
liability.  
When “Laundry Listing” Is Advantageous for the Insured 
A certain degree of selectivity is required when notifying an insurer of potential claims under a 
policy’s discovery provision. There is, however, one situation in which it is clearly advantageous to 
report every possible incident as a potential claim. This happens when an insurer will no longer be 
writing a specific line of coverage and therefore nonrenews or cancels all policies (of a certain 
coverage line, or in a specific territory, for example).  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
88 In this case, an insured may consider reportin g more possible circumstances under a policy’s 
discovery provision than he or she ordinarily would be inclined if the policy were being renewed. By 
laundry listing these circumstances, the insured would not be faced with higher renewal premiums or 
possible cancellation/nonrenewal by the incumbent in surer. Also important is the fact that a 
replacement insurer would tend to be more understanding of an insured who “laundry lists” under 
these conditions, recognizing that the measure is more justifiable because there is no guarantee that the insured will be able to secure a replacement policy. 
When “Laundry Lists”  Are Rejected 
On the other hand, “laundry lists” are often rejected by insurers. This is especially true if, as already noted, an insured merely compiles a list of all clie nts, cases, or projects conducted within the past 
several years, without providing specific details a bout the acts that could result in potential liability 
associated with services rendered. Therefore, unde r most circumstances, an insured should only 
supply information about circumstances that he or  she believes—on a “good-faith” basis—have the 
potential for producing a claim. 
Extended Reporting Provisions 
Extended reporting periods (ERPs), which are also known as extended discovery or "tail" provisions 
and are included in all fiduciary liability policies, gi ve an insured the right to present claims after a 
policy has expired or been canceled. Exhibit 15.3 illustrates how an ERP provision functions. 
 
EXHIBIT 15.3 
HOW AN EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD FUNCTIONS 
Insurer A’s Policy Term: 1/1/11–12 
Insured buys an ERP from Insurer A with an ERP term of 1/1/12–13 
Wrongful Act: 7/1/11 Claim Made and Reported: 7/1/12 
 Wrongful 
Act  Claim Made 
and 
Reported   
1/1/11 7/1/11 1/1/12  7/1/12 1/1/13  
------x------------------x------------------x-----------------x------------------x------------- 
Coverage applies under the ERP because the wrongful act took place during Insurer A's 
1/1/11–12 policy term and a claim associated with the act was made and reported during the 
term of Insurer A's 1/1/12–13 ERP. One final, key point regarding ERPs: no coverage would have applied in this example if both the wrongful  act took place and the claim were reported 
during the 1/1/12–13 ERP period. Rather, the wrongful act must take place during the expired/canceled policy period for coverage to apply during the ERP.   
ERPs Do Not Reinstate Remaining Policy Limits 
ERPs do not, however, increase or reinstate the policy's limit of liability. Thus, coverage during an 
extended reporting period is always subject to availa ble remaining limits under the original policy. In 
some instances, especially where one or more signifi cant claims are pending under an expiring policy, 
insurers will, at times, make additional lim its available under an ERP provision. However, Chapter 15—Fiduciary Liability  Policy Covera ge Triggers 
89 reinstatement of this type will almost always require substantial additional premium, over and above 
the scale provided for in the policy, and as discussed below. 
No Coverage for Wrongful Acts during the ERP 
Nor do ERPs cover claims from wrongful acts that took place during the ERP. In effect, they only 
extend the time period during which wrongful acts that took place during the expired (or in some 
instances, canceled) policy can be reported to the insu rer. Thus, for coverage to apply under an ERP, 
the alleged wrongful act giving rise to the claim must  have taken place on or after the retroactive date, 
if any, of the policy and before the policy's termination date. ERPs do not affo rd coverage for an act 
that took place during the extended reporting period itsel f, in spite of the fact that such a claim is 
reported during the ERP.  
Discovery Provisi ons versus ERPs 
Although these two provisions are often confused , the difference is actually straightforward. 
Discovery provisions allow insureds to obtain cove rage for incidents or potential claims that are 
reported during the policy period. In contrast, ERPs provide coverage for claims that are reported after a policy period has expired. 
Key Variations between ERP Provisions 
There are several important variations between the key provisions associated with ERPs as they are 
written by the different fiduciary liability insurers . These differences are described in the following 
paragraphs.  
Availability 
The vast majority of fiduciary liability fo rms permit the insured to purchase an ERP if 
cancellation/nonrenewal is at the insured's or the insurer's election. This is known as a two-way or 
bilateral tail. A few provide this option only in th e event that cancellation/nonrenewal is initiated by 
the insurer, termed a one-way tail. Clearly, fiduciary liability policy forms that contain bilateral ERPs 
are preferable to those offering only a one-way tail provision. The latter should be vigorously resisted when negotiating coverage with an insurer. 
Coverage for "Notice of Circumstances" or "Incidents" during the ERP 
A key variation between the ERPs in fiduciary lia bility forms is whether a report of circumstances 
that have the potential—but have not yet resulted in  a formal claim against the insured—are covered 
by an ERP. In effect, under some insurers' ERP wording, the policy's discovery provision (discussed 
earlier in this chapter) is operative, whereas in others, it is not.  
To illustrate: A fiduciary liability policy expires on January 1, 2010, at which time the insured firm 
buys a 1-year ERP. On August 1, 2010, the insured firm becomes aware of circumstances (from a wrongful act that took place during the expired policy) that could potentially materialize into a formal 
claim but have not yet. Under some insurers' policies, the report of such circumstances would trigger 
coverage. However, under other insu rers' ERP wording, no coverage  would apply until the insured 
has a formal claim made against it, even if these circumstances are reported to the insurer during the 
ERP. 
  Fiduciary Liability Exposures  and Insurance Coverage 
90 Given the above scenario, the insured would be comp elled to purchase (if available) another ERP at 
the expiration of the current ERP, if the potential claim had not yet been made against the firm but 
was expected at some point. In this situation, th e advantage of having a policy's discovery provision 
that is operative during the ERP provision is apparent.   
Duration 
In most instances, fiduciary liability insurers offe r ERPs of 1 year in duration, although in a few 
cases, ERPs of longer duration are offered, as well.  Multiple duration options (e.g. 1 year, 2 years, 
and 3 years) are occasionally available under fiduciary  liability policies written for privately-held and 
not-for-profit organizations. However, publicly-trade d companies are rarely offered anything other 
than a 1-year option.  
Premium Charge 
In nearly all instances, the polici es state the premium charge for th e ERP option. This is typically 
done by indicating that the ERP will cost a fixed percentage of the expiring policy's premium; 
normally 100 to 150 percent, depending upon the individual policy, for a 1-year ERP.  
Time in Which To Elect 
The policies allow the insured up to 30 days foll owing nonrenewal, expiration, or cancellation to 
purchase the ERP. A few allow as long as 60 days in wh ich to make this election, which is, of course, 
preferable since it is beneficial to maximize the time period in which the insured can make this 
election. 
Runoff Policies 
As an alternative to an ERP, there are certain  circumstances under which insureds should consider 
purchasing a runoff policy. 
Runoff Policies versus ERPs 
Like ERPs, runoff policies also permit an insured to report claims (that resulted from wrongful acts taking place during prior policy periods) for a specified period of time in the future. In contrast, the 
use of runoff policies is typically restricted to s ituations in which an insured merges with or is 
acquired by another organization, rather than when the insured replaces coverage with another 
insurer, as is usually the case when an ERP is purchased. Like ERPs, runoff policies are usually 
offered on a 1-year basis. However, unlike ERPs, they are generally offered on a renewable basis.  
Why Are Claims-Made Coverage Triggers Used for Fiduciary 
Policies? 
The key reason underwriters use claims-made triggers  to write fiduciary liability policies (rather than 
occurrence triggers) is that claims-made policies ma ke it easier to predict their ultimate liability on 
any given set of fiduciary liability policies they may write, which assists them in setting more 
accurate rates for succeeding policies. 
  
 Chapter 15—Fiduciary Liability  Policy Covera ge Triggers 
91 More Accurate Prediction of Ultimate Claim Liabilities 
Normally, there is a fairly long time lag between the commission of a wrongful act by a fiduciary and 
the making of a claim. As a result, if underwriters wrote an entire book of fiduciary liability business using occurrence triggers, at the expiration of an  occurrence policy term, the underwriter could still 
expect a number of claims to be made. For exam ple, under a book of business written with a January 
1, 2010–11 term, on an occurrence basis, any claim th at occurred within this time frame could still be 
made against the insured 5, or even 10 years later,  and would thus be covered by the policy. This time 
lag makes it difficult to set rates for succeeding policies, since the underwriter still doesn’t know 
his/her actual dollar claim exposure on the just-expired policies.  
Rate Setting under Occurrence versus Claims-Made Policies 
In contrast, under a book of fiduc iary liability business written with claims-made coverage triggers, 
virtually all claims under such policies will have al ready been made on the date of expiration (or, no 
later than 60 days after this date, if the polici es contained 60-day post-policy reporting windows). 
Accordingly, the underwriter is better able to assess his/her actual liability for ultimate claims 
payments under such policies than if they were written on an occurrence basis. This fact makes it much easier to set accurate premium rates fo r succeeding fiduciary liability policies.  
 
Chapter 15 Review Questions  
1. Chuck Little made a fiduciary liability claim against Blue Sky Company’s benefit plan 
administrators last year when Blue Sky was insured by Egg Insurance Company. Upon hearing that Blue Sky never reported the claim to  its insurer before it ch anged insurers and is 
now insured by Chicken Insurance Company,  he files another claim with the same 
allegations, which Blue Sky pr omptly reports to Chicken Insurance Company. Because both 
policies have claims-first-made language in th eir policy triggers, Chuck’s claims trigger 
coverage under: 
a. Egg Insurance Company’s policy. 
b. Chicken Insurance Company’s policy. 
c. Both Egg Insurance Company and Chicken Insurance Company policies. 
d. Neither Egg Insurance Company nor Ch icken Insurance Company policies. 
2. Mirror Company’s fiduciary liability policy has a January 1, 2009, retroactive date. Assuming 
all other conditions are met, coverage applies under the policy for claims resulting from 
wrongful acts that take place: a. After the policy expires on January 1, 2009. 
b. Before January 1, 2009.  
c. Before the policy expires on January 1, 2009. 
d. On or after January 1, 2009.

92 3. When investigators broke the news that Daniel had made off with millions of dollars invested 
in his Ponzi scheme, trustees of the Gopher-Broke  defined benefit plan revealed that plan 
funds had been heavily invested in Daniel’s worthless scheme and the plan might now be 
unable to pay promised benefits. Trustees predic t that plan beneficiaries will bring actions 
against them for years to come and regret ha ving made such bad investment decisions. If the 
trustees utilize their fiduciary liability policy’s di scovery provision and report this incident to 
the insurer during the current policy period, 
a. Any resulting claims will be treated as though th ey were made before the retroactive date 
expires. 
b. Any resulting claims will be treated as though  they are made during the current policy 
period.  
c. The trustees enable the insurer to allocate policy limits among the resulting claims. 
d. The trustees preserve their rights to renew the policy despite this incident. 
4. Wyatt’s fiduciary liability policy has a policy term of July 1, 2011 – July 1, 2012 and an ERP 
term of July 1, 2012 – July 1, 2013. A wr ongful act took place on October 1, 2012, and a 
claim was made and reported to the insurer on February 1, 2013. In this situation:  
a. Coverage applies because the event occurre d and the claim was made during Wyatt’s 
ERP. 
b. Coverage applies because the event occurre d and the claim was made during Wyatt’s 
policy period. 
c. Coverage does not apply because the event occurred after the policy period. 
d. Coverage does not apply because the claim was made after the policy period. 
   
Answers to Chapter 15 Review Questions 
1. d. Coverage applies under neither policy. No coverage applies under the Egg Insurance Company 
policy, because the claim was never reported to the insurer. No coverage applies under the Chicken Insurance Company policy because the wrongful act giving rise to the claim took place during the 
Egg Insurance Company’s policy term. But despite having knowledge of the claim, the insured never 
reported it to Egg Insurance Company. Therefore, the Chicken Insurance Company would be able to deny coverage for late reporting of a claim about which the insured had prior knowledge. 
2. d. for coverage to apply, the wrongful act giving rise to a claim must have taken place on or after the retroactive date. 
3. b. If the insured advises the insurer of “incidents” or “potential claims” during the policy period, any 
actual claims arising out of such “incidents” will be considered to have been made during that policy 
period. 
4. c. No coverage applies if both the wrongful act ta kes place and the claim is reported during the ERP 
period; rather, the wrongful act must take place during the expi red/canceled policy period for 
coverage to apply during the ERP.
