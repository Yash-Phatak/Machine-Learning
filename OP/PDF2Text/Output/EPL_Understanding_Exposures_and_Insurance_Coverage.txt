1 Introduction 
This course is designed to give a moderately experienced insura nce person a detailed look at (1) the 
liability exposures that give rise to employment-related claims  and (2) the insuran ce policies that have 
been developed to cover these exposures. 
The first part of the course begins by describing the most impo rtant common law (i.e., law based on 
judicial decisions) exposures to employment litigation and cont inues by discussing the leading statutory 
exposures to such claims. Next, t he underwriting of employment practices liability (EPL) insurance is 
analyzed, followed by a description of methods to control emplo yment claims. The first part of the course 
concludes by examining the various sources of EPL insurance (EP LI) coverage. 
The second part of the course takes a detailed look at the spec ific coverage terms within EPLI policy 
forms, including covered persons /organizations and covered acts  provisions. Next, it discusses third-party 
liability coverage, along with “ damages” and “claim” definition s. Claims management, defense cost, and 
“special conditions” are also described. The course concludes w ith an analysis of exclusions and coverage 
triggers contained within the policies. 
 Chapter 1 discusses three of the five most important common law  exposures to EPL claims: 
discrimination, wrongful termi nation, and sexual harassment. 
 Chapter 2 continues with the d iscussion of common law exposures  to EPL claims and examines 
the other two prominent common law exposures to employment clai ms: retaliation and 
inappropriate employment conduct.  
 Chapter 3 discusses the statutor y liability sources of discrimi nation claims. The most important 
statutes include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the  Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act (ADEA) of 1967, the Ameri cans with Disabilities Act (ADA) o f 1992, and the Family and 
Medical leave Act (FMLA) of 1993.  
 Chapter 4 explores the key factors that insurers use to price a nd underwrite EPL coverage, 
including jurisdiction, industry, number of employees, profitab ility, mix of exempt/nonexempt 
employees, and claim history. 
 Chapter 5 describes ways to reduce the exposures to EPL claims,  including effective hiring, using 
protective legal documents, reducing risks associated with term inations, correct ways to provide 
references, and methods of preven ting sexual harassment claims.  
 Chapter 6 describes the three s ources of EPL coverage: (1) stan d-alone EPL forms, (2) 
management liability package po licies, and (3) endorsements to businessowners policies (BOPs).  
 Chapter 7 begins the course’s d etailed discussion of EPL polici es, examining the covered 
organizations, covered persons, a nd covered acts provisions in the policies. 
 Chapter 8 analyzes the third-pa rty liability, covered damages, and covered claim definition found 
in EPL policies. 
 Chapter 9 discusses the claims m anagement, defense cost, and sp ecial conditions provisions 
within EPL policies. 
 Chapter 10 describes the exclusi ons contained in EPL policy for ms and explains the significance 
of exception language within these exclusions.  
2  Chapter 11 analyzes the manner in  which an EPL policy’s coverag e triggers apply. Concepts such 
as claims first made, retroactiv e dates, discovery provisions, and extended reporting provisions 
are discussed. 
A glossary, which follows Chapter 11, provides definitions of m any terms and acronyms used in this 
course. Refer to the glossary if  you have difficulty understand ing any of the terms or remembering what 
the various acronyms stand for.

employment-related exposures such statutes create; 
 identify the key factors used to price EPLI coverage and recogn ize the importance of such factors 
within the underwriting process; 
 given relevant case information , identify effective methods of reducing exposures to employment 
liability claims and recognize how  such methods can also lower claim settlement amounts; 
 compare the various methods of obtaining EPLI coverage; 
 recognize how the covered persons/c overed organizations/covered  acts provisions function within 
EPL policies; 
 recognize the scope of coverage provided by (a) third-party lia bility provisions, along with the (b) 
“claim” and (c) “damages” definiti ons included within the polic ies; 
 recognize the function of the (a)  claims management, (b) defens e cost, and (c) special conditions 
provisions within EPL policies; 
 identify the most important exclusions found within EPL policie s and recognize the operation and 
significance of the key “exception” wording commonly found with in these exclusions; and

coverage.  
3 Chapter 1 
Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 1) 
Overview 
Employment liability claims made under common law (i.e., law ba sed on judicial decisions, as opposed to 
statutes) typically arise from one of the following five broad categories of conduct: (1) discrimination, (2) 
wrongful termination, (3) sexual harassment (although legally, sexual harassment is a form of 
discrimination), (4) retaliation , and (5) inappropriate employm ent conduct (also sometimes referred to as 
“miscellaneous workplace torts”), a “catchall” term that includ es but is not limited to such perils as 
constructive discharge, invasion of privacy, failure to promote , and defamation.  
Chapter 1 discusses the first thr ee of these common law claim s ources: discrimination, wrongful 
termination, and sexual harassme nt. Chapter 2 examines the latt er two common law exposures (retaliation 
and inappropriate employment conduct).

 recognize the characteristics of discrimination, wrongful termi nation, and sexual harassment 
claims and 
 identify potential defenses agai nst discrimination, wrongful te rmination, and sexual harassment 
claims. 
Discrimination 
Lawsuits alleging employment-rela ted discrimination can be grou ped into one of two broad categories: 
(a) disparate treatment discrimination claims and (b) disparate  impact discrimination claims. 
Disparate Treatment Di scrimination Claims 
Disparate treatment discrimination claims involve illegal, deli berate discrimination against an individual, 
such as failing to promote an ot herwise qualified employee base d on race.  
Disparate Impact Discrimination Claims 
Disparate impact discrimination claims involve seemingly neutra l company policies that have the actual 
effect of discriminating against a certain class of persons —rather than against an individual (as is the case 
with disparate treatment discrim ination). For example, if a cit y required all police officers to be at least 5 
feet 10 inches tall, a female applicant might allege that this requirement unfairly discriminated against 
females because the average woman is considerably shorter than 5 feet 10 inches tall.  
A claimant who successfully alleges disparate impact must also demonstrate that, in addition to 
disproportionally impacting a certain class of persons, the pol icy must bear little or no relationship to the 
ability to actually perform the job in question. The example be low illustrates this point.   
4 The Policy Must Impact the Ability  to Perform the Job: Two Key Examples 
A notable example of disparate im pact discrimination was the US  Supreme Court case of Griggs v. Duke 
Power Co.,  401 U.S. 424 (1971). Here, an empl oyer’s requirement that all job applicants have a high 
school education or pass a standardized intelligence test, whil e racially neutral, was found to constitute 
disparate impact discrimination. This was because it had a disp roportionately negative impact on 
minorities and, importantly, was unrelated  to actual job performance for the positions to which the 
requirement pertained.  
A different result was reached in a more recent case heard by t he US Supreme Court in 2009. In Ricci v. 
DiStefano (557 U.S., 129 S. Ct. 2658, 174 L . Ed. 2d 490 (2009)). Here, th e court found that a promotional 
exam, used by the New Haven, Conn. Fire Department to select li eutenants and captains, was not racially 
discriminatory. This was despite the fact that 22 of the test-t akers were African American, yet none 
scored high enough to qualify for promotion to either type of p osition. In a 5–4 vote, the court ruled that 
(1) the exam was job-related and that (2) no equally valid—but less discriminatory—exam existed.  
In the first case, Duke Power’s r equirement that all job applic ants have a high school education was held 
to be discriminatory because a hi gh school education was not re levant to perform many jobs within the 
company. On the other hand, i n the second case, the New Haven F ire Department’s exam for lieutenants 
and captains was not held to be discriminatory, because it did test areas that were important to these jobs.  
Exceptions to Laws Barring Disp arate Treatment Discrimination 
In a small handful of circumstan ces, courts have allowed employ ment practices that would otherwise be 
considered discriminatory under both common and federal employm ent laws. For example, in a 2012 
ruling in the case of Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC,  132 S. Ct. 394 
(2012), the US Supreme Court held, 9–0, that a church had a rig ht to terminate a lay teacher, despite the 
fact that the termination violated the Americans with Disabilit ies Act (ADA), as well as other federal and 
state laws barring discrimination. By means of the doctrine kno wn as the “ministerial exception” to the 
ADA, the court ruled that church es have wide latitude in determ ining which persons they choose to 
employ and retain, even if otherwise discriminatory practices a re used in making such decisions.  
Wrongful Termination 
Wrongful termination is the act of terminating an employee in a  manner that is against the law. 
Wrongful termination also encompasses so-called constructive discharge . In these situations, the 
employee retains his or her job. However, the employee’s work e nvironment is intentionally made so 
difficult that he or she is for ced to resign to protect his or her financial or physical and emotional well-
being (e.g., an employee is forced to work excessive hours in p hysically unsafe conditions or for 
substantially less money than he or she was previously earning) . 
Two key factors have triggered a marked increase in claims alle ging wrongful termination: (1) the 
restructuring of corporate Amer ica (i.e., mergers and acquisiti on in which large-scale layoffs result, 
especially among employees of the acquired firm) and (2) the er osion of the employmen t-at-will doctrine. 
Corporate Restructuring 
Beginning in the 1970s, the large-scale restructuring of corpor ate America has taken a number of forms, 
including downsizing (much of which resulted from increased use  of automation), outsourcing, mergers 
and acquisitions, plant closings , and the transfer of manufactu ring to non-US locations. In combination, 
such activities have resulted in substantial elimination of job s, which, in turn, has produced allegations 
that employees were wrongfully terminated.  
5 Employment-at-Will Doctrine 
Historically, in the absence of a written employment contract, employment relationships in the United 
States were “at will”—that is, either the employer or employee was free to terminate the employment 
relationship at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at a ll. The majority of the states continue to 
follow the at-will doctrine, although the employment-at-will ru le has eroded somewhat due to modern 
trends in the courts and legislatures that have expanded employ ees’ rights to sue for wrongful termination. 
There are, however, three lega l grounds upon which wrongful dis charge claims can be made and which 
can therefore be considered “ex ceptions” to the employment-at-w ill doctrine. These legal grounds include 
(1) violation of public policy , (2) breach of an express or imp lied contract to discharge only for good 
cause, and (3) breach of an implie d covenant of good faith and fair dealing. These bases are discussed as 
follows. 
Violation of Public Policy 
Under this theory, which is rec ognized in more than two-thirds of all states, an employee can pursue a 
wrongful discharge cla im when his or her discharge affects a pu blic right. Public policy claims often stem 
from refusal to participate in illegal activities (e.g., paddin g the cost of services delivered under a 
government contract), refusal to perform a lawful act (e.g., no t consenting to undergo alcohol or drug 
testing where such refusal is protected by law), reporting empl oyer wrongdoing (e.g., “whistleblowing”), 
or refusing to perform an act that public policy condemns (e.g. , lying under oath).  
Breach of an Express or an Implied Contract 
An employee allegedly terminated in violation of a contract mus t be able to prove that (1) the employer 
and employee had entered into an agreement sufficiently definit e and certain regarding the conditions of 
employment; (2) the employer breached the contract; (3) the emp loyee performed his or her side of the 
bargain; and (4) the employee h as suffered injury as a result o f the employer’s breach. (In most breaches, 
the nature of the alleged injury will be financial. That is, te rmination caused the ex-employee to lose 
income; although, in a minority of  claims, the alleged injury i s damage to the ex-employee’s reputation.) 
If an employee proves that he or she is entitled to damages und er breach of contract, the employee is still 
obligated to mitigate the poten tial damages by actively seeking  comparable employment.  
Even in the absence of a written contract of employment, courts  have found non-written employment 
contracts to exist under certain circumstances. Employment manu als or handbooks have been found to 
create an implied contract between an employee and the employer  in cases where the employer sets out 
grievance procedures for employ ees, either before or after term ination. For example, in Toussaint v. Blue 
Cross & Blue Shield , 408 Mich. 579 (1980), the Michiga n Supreme Court held that, b y establishing 
personnel policies and practices with respect to termination, t he employer had created legitimate 
expectations by its employees that they would not be dismissed without cause. Other factors that a court 
may look at to find an implied c ontract for employment include (1) material contained in a job offer letter, 
(2) outstanding praise of an employee’s work, (3) favorable per formance reviews, and (4) length of 
employment with the company.  
Breach of an Implied Covenant of Good Faith 
Even in the absence of an implied contract of employment, a han dful of states have found that there exists 
an implied covenant within the employee-employer relationship. This covenant serves to prevent the 
employer from unjustifiably enga ging in conduct that would deny  an employee the reasonably anticipated 
benefits of an employment relati onship. An example of such a cl aim would include one for which there 
was no basis for terminating an e mployee, other than to replace  the terminated worker with a relative of 
the supervisor.  
6 Sexual Harassment 
Sexual harassment includes a variety of conduct such as unwelco me sexual advances, requests for sexual 
favors, and verbal, visual, and/ or physical conduct of a sexual  nature. There are two types of sexual 
harassment that occur within a  workplace context: (1) quid pro quo sexual harassme nt and (2) hostile 
environment sexual harassment.  
It should also be mentioned that, while sexual harassment is ac tually a form of discrimination, it has 
become such a common employment-related cause of action that it  is usually considered a separate 
category unto itself. 
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment 
Quid pro quo sexual harassment  occurs when sexual contact is ma de a condition of emp loyment, meaning 
that an employee is required to p rovide sexual favors in return  for keeping a job or receiving certain 
benefits or privileges. Case in point: A supervisor commits qui d pro quo sexual harassment when he or 
she obtains sexual favors from one of his or her employees in r eturn for a promotion or a raise. If proven, 
employers are almost always strictly liable  (i.e., automatically liable, a nd, thus, the employer would hav e 
no valid defense) for quid pro quo sexual harassment.  
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment 
Hostile environment sexual harass ment, which is far more common ly alleged than quid pro quo sexual 
harassment, is conduct of a sexua l nature that creates an intim idating, hostile, or offensive working 
environment or impedes an individual’s work performance. Commen ts, threats, jokes, and pictures are 
frequently the basis on which such claims are made.  
Factors in Assessing Whether an Environment Is Hostile 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) examines the  following six factors in 
assessing whether a working envir onment is hostile: (1) whether  the conduct was verbal or physical or 
both, (2) the frequency of the  conduct, (3) whether the conduct  was hostile or potentially offensive, (4) 
whether the offensive conduct w as by a coworker or supervisor, (5) the number of persons involved in the 
harassment, and (6) whether the harassment was directed at more  than one individual.  
The following points also characterize sexual harassment liabil ity.  
 A Single Event Can Constitute Ho stile Environment Sexual Harass ment.  Some courts have 
held that a single incident, i f sufficiently egregious, can cre ate a hostile environment. For 
example, in Radtke v. Everett , 442 Mich. 368, 501 N.W.2d 155 (1993), the Michigan Supreme 
Court held that a sexual assault created a hostile environment.  The case involved a veterinary 
technician who was in a situation where she was working alone w ith a veterinarian, who 
attempted to seduce her in a hospital lounge.  
 Employer Failure to Protect an Em ployee from Sexual Harassment by a Nonemployee. One 
subcategory of hostile environmen t sexual harassment claims inc ludes those arising from an 
employer’s failure to protect an employee from sexual harassmen t by a nonemployee. Typically, 
sexual harassment claims arise when one employee alleges that a nother employee harassed him 
or her. However, employees sometimes make claims charging haras sment by nonemployee third 
parties such as customers, client s, vendors, or independent con tractors.  
For example, in Powell v. Las Vegas Hilton Corp ., 841 F. Supp. 1024 ( 1992), a casino worker 
claimed hostile work environmen t sexual harassment because cust omers repeatedly told her that 
she had a “nice body,” stared at her, and made suggestive remar ks. She contended , and the court 
agreed with her, that her employer was liable because her emplo yer knew of the harassment and 
failed to promptly take necessary steps to stop it. As a genera l rule, once an employer has  
7 knowledge that an employee is being harassed by one or more thi rd parties, the business has an 
obligation to put a stop to suc h harassment and protect the emp loyee. Failure to take such 
actions—once it is aware of the problem—increases the probabili ty that the employer will be 
found liable. 
 Employer Liable for Harassment Despite Lack of Knowledge If Adv erse Action Occurs. In 
June 1998, the US Supreme Court issued an important ruling rega rding sexual harassment in 
Farragher v. City of Boca Raton,  524 U.S. 775 (1998). The pla intiff, Beth Ann Farragher, 
brought a claim asserting that h er supervisors had created a se xually hostile atmosphere in which 
she and other female lifeguards were offensively touched. In ad dition, Ms. Farragher stated that 
one of her supervisors said that he would never promote a woman  unless she dated him. The 
ruling in this case established that a company will be held lia ble for sexually harassing actions 
taken by its employees—despite the company’s lack of awareness of such actions—if these 
actions result in an “adverse tangible employment action,” whic h, in this case, involved a 
requirement that the plaintiff date the supervisor to secure a promotion.  
 But, a Defense Is Available under Certain Circumstances. On the other hand, the court in 
Farragher  did indicate that, when no “adverse tangible employment action ” has taken place, 
employers do have a defense to liability if they can show that a well-publicized and effectively 
implemented sexual harassment policy was in place.  
In effect, Farragher  indicates that a company will be held liable for sexual harass ment if the 
harassment is accompanied by an “adverse tangible employment ac tion.” But, in the absence  of 
sexual harassment that includes an adverse employment action, a  company does have a valid 
defense to liability if it can show the existence of an effecti ve and well-publicized sexual 
harassment policy. 
 No Need to Prove Psychological Harm.  The US Supreme Court held in Harris v. Forklift Sys., 
Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993), that a  plaintiff does not have to prove 
that he or she suffered permanen t or long-term psychological ha rm as a result of harassment to 
recover damages. Eliminating this requirement greatly increases  the chance that a plaintiff will be 
able to successfully establish a hostile environment sexual har assment claim. 
 Jury Trials and Monetary Recoveries Permitted.  The Civil Rights Act of 1991 amended the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which previously contained significan tly fewer remedies for sexual 
harassment. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 now allows (1) jury tr ials in hostile environment sexual 
harassment cases and (2) punitive damages.  
An Employer Is Not Strictly Liabl e for Harassment by Non-Superv isor  
In Vance v. Ball State Univ. , 133 S. Ct. 23 (2012), by a 5–4 majority, the US Supreme Court  found that an 
employer is not “strictly liable” for the acts of a non-supervi sor when an employee asserts a claim for 
workplace harassment. In contrast, an employer is subject to st rict liability when a supervisor harasses an 
employee.  
The court found that since the offending employee did not have the power to “hire, fire, demote, promote, 
transfer, or discipline” Ms. Vance, she was therefore not Ms. V ance’s “supervisor.” As a result, unless 
Ms. Vance could prove that BSU was negligent in preventing the alleged harassment (i.e., that BSU was 
aware of the ongoing harassment  and did nothing to stop it), it  was not liable for Ms. Davis’s actions.  
The issue of whether a business could be held strictly liable f or a non-supervisor’s  conduct was an open 
question—until this case. Now, as a consequence of this ruling,  where a coworker is the harasser, an 
employer is liable for the harassment only if the employer was negligent in not preventing the coworker’s 
offensive behavior. (The court’s ruling in Vance  mirrors the current federal standard that was already  
8 applicable in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massach usetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, North Dakota, R hode Island, South Dakota, and Wi sconsin.)  
Affirmative Defenses to Hostile  Environment Sexual Harassment C laims 
The case of Madray v. Publix Supermarkets , 208 F.3d 1290 (2000), established that if an employer has 
developed, communicated, and enfo rced a sexual harassment polic y but an employee fails to avail him or 
herself of that policy by not reporting sexual harassment, the company has a valid defense to a hostile 
environment sexual ha rassment claim.  
Sexual Harassment Policy—by Itself—Not a Defense 
The Madray ruling does not, however, hold that a comprehensive sexual hara ssment policy, in itself, is 
sufficient to defend against all hostile work environment claim s. Therefore, employers not only must 
create, communicate, and enforce sexual harassment policies and  procedures but also must act promptly 
and appropriately to investigate all harassment claims. The extent to which an em ployer takes each of 
these actions will add to the stre ngth of its defense in any se xual harassment claim. 
Superior-Subordinate Sexual Harassment: The Ultimate Taboo  
Although allegations of sexual ha rassment can arise in any rela tionship, a business is especially 
susceptible to claims when these allegations result from a supe rior-subordinate relationship. Serious 
liability exposure is more likely  to arise when office romances  involve a disparate power relationship .  
Sexual Harassment Claims  Alleging “Favoritism” 
Office relationships have also b een the source of claims allegi ng a hostile work environment based on the 
assertion that a person who is rom antically involved with a sup erior will receive unduly favorable 
treatment  relative to his or her peers a nd coworkers. Accordingly, these  kinds of circumstances have been 
the source of so-called favoritism claims. 
 
 
    
 
     
  
9 Costs Associated with Sexual Harassment Claims 
The law firm of Littler Mendelson , P.C., and Employment Law Lea rning Technologies conducted a study 
in which they developed a list of both “hard” (i.e., quantifiab le) and “soft” (i.e., nonquantifiable) costs 
associated with sexual harassment claims. These costs are outli ned in Exhibit 1.1. 
 
Exhibit 1.1 
Sexual Harassment Claims Costs 
Hard Costs   
 Attorneys’ fees, settlement c osts, or jury awards (if the 
case is not settled) 
Soft Costs   
 Employee distraction and reduced morale  
 Management time expended in the claim resolution 
process 
 Employee time expended in the claim resolution process 
 Employee time spent investigating the claim  
 Employee time spent p reparing for trial  
 Increased future insurance premiums 
 Increased future insurance deductibles/retentions  
 Lowered stock price and damage to corporate reputation  
 Potential of copycat lawsuits due to internal and external 
publicity  
 Increased difficulty in attr acting top employees given 
negative publicity

12 Chapter 2 
Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 2) 
Overview 
Chapter 2 discusses the two add itional common law claim sources  of employment-related claims: 
retaliation and inappropria te employment conduct.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the characteristics of retaliation and inappropriate employment conduct claims and 
 identify potential defenses agai nst retaliation and inappropria te employment conduct claims. 
Retaliation 
The number of employment-relate d claims alleging retaliation ha s exploded over time. Such claims 
usually consist of two distinct pa rts. The first part of the cl aim will allege that an employee was 
discriminated against based on a protected status, such as race , gender, or disability. The second portion 
of the claim will assert that, in retaliation for making such a claim , the employee was treated adversely. 
For example, after receiving a poor performance review, an empl oyee is demoted. Following the 
demotion, she makes a claim alle ging that the demotion was base d on racial discrimination. Shortly after 
the claim is filed, the employee is retaliated against by being  actively “shunned” by her boss and co-
workers.  
One especially problematic aspect  of retaliation claims is that  they can remain viable even after a court 
rejects the first portion of the employee’s complaint alleging discrimination or another “standard” 
employment practices allegation. Thus, in the example above, a court could rule that there was no 
discrimination on the basis of r ace in making the decision to d emote the employee but that the “shunning” 
did constitute retaliation for having made the discrimination clai m.  
Retaliation can also occur under a variety of other circumstanc es, such as an employee being retaliated 
against for making a workers compensation claim, whistleblowing , or criticizing management.  
Elements of a Retaliation Claim  
A successful claim of retaliation must prove three elements: (1 ) that the employee engaged in a protected 
activity; (2) that the employee suffered an adverse action; and  (3) that there was a causal connection 
between the adverse action and the protected activity. 
Protected Activities 
Examples of protected activities include alleging employment di scrimination; opposing employment 
discrimination; threatening to file a formal complaint concerni ng illegal corporate practices; requesting a 
religious or disability accommodation; or making a complaint to  a manager, union official, or newspaper 
reporter about discrimination against oneself or others.  
13 Adverse Actions 
Examples of obvious types of adve rse actions include denial of a promotion, refusal to hire, demotion, 
suspension, and discharge. Other examples of adverse action inc lude threats, reprimands, negative 
evaluations, harassment, and cha nge in hours. Adverse actions a re not limited to situations in which a 
person is currently employed by a  given organization. In additi on, adverse actions can take place after  an 
individual is no longer with a c ompany. Examples of post-employ ment retaliation include giving an 
unjustified negative job referen ce, refusing to provide a job r eference, or informing an individual’s 
prospective employer about the individual’s protected activity (e.g., having made a complaint to a 
manager).  
Causal Connection 
To establish a causal connection between the protected activity  and the adverse action, an employee may, 
for example, provide evidence th at the day after she testified against her employer in a racial 
discrimination case, she received a demotion and was transferre d to a new location. 
Important Court Decisions  on Retaliation Claims 
Exhibit 2.1 lists a number of important court decisions address ing whether a specific employer action 
constitutes retaliation. Based on these and numerous other stat e and federal courts’ rulings, it becomes 
apparent that what, exactly, c onstitutes retaliation often come s down to a close analysis of case-specific 
facts. Indeed, retaliation for legal purposes is often difficul t to determine.  
 
Exhibit 2.1  
What Constitutes Retaliation? Key Court Decisions  
Issue and Court Ruling  Case Citation

357 (7th Cir. Dec. 8, 2009) 
“Whistleblower” Claims 
Retaliation claims can also be bro ught independently by people who are not in a protected category, based 
on an assertion that the person w as penalized for complaining o f or opposing certain employer actions 
(e.g., billing practices on a government contract), refusing to  engage in illegal or unethical conduct, or 
exposing such conduct via testimony  at a trial or administrativ e hearing. Such claims are a subcategory of 
retaliation claims and are sometimes called “whistleblower” cla ims.  
14 Inappropriate Workplace Conduct 
In some instances, work-related claims are made that do not all ege discrimination, wrongful termination, 
sexual harassment, or retaliation.  
Claims alleging inappropriate w orkplace conduct sometimes produ ce even larger damages awards and 
settlements than do claims of wrongful termination, discriminat ion, sexual harassment, or retaliation. This 
is because compensation is not mer ely based on the plaintiff’s loss of salary (as is the case with these four 
types of claims) but also on th e extent of personal injury resu lting from the inappropriate conduct, usually 
including emotional distress damages, which in some claims is a lleged to have caused actual physical 
injury, such as a heart attack o r a stroke. Additionally, in so me states, punitive damages can be awarded 
for successful claims of inappropriate workplace conduct.  
Exhibit 2.2 provides a listing of the most common allegations t hat constitute inappropriate workplace 
conduct. They are discussed in more detail in the pages that fo llow. 
 
Exhibit 2.2 
Representative Inappropriate Workplace Conduct 
 Unlawful requests for social media access 
 Defamation  
 Invasion of privacy 
 Fraud, misrepresentation 
 Negligence 
 Intentional/negligent infliction of emotional distress 
 Bullying 
 Breach of an employment contract  
 Coercion  
 Wrongful failure to employ  
 Wrongful failure to promote  
 Wrongful discipline  
 Wrongful deprivation of a career opportunity  
 Wrongful failure to grant tenure  
 Wrongful failure to grant a partnership 
 Negligent evaluation  
 
The term “miscellaneous workplace torts” is also sometimes used  as a synonym for the variety of acts 
referred to as “inappropriate workplace conduct.”  
Unlawful Employer Request s for Social Media Access 
Corresponding with the rise of soc ial media, a number of employ ers have asked both employees and job 
applicants for their Facebook p asswords. For example, in April 2012, a teacher’s aide in Michigan was 
suspended after refusing to p rovide access to her Facebook acco unt following complaints over a picture 
she posted. 
As reported in “Six States Outlaw Employer Snooping on Facebook ,” an article by Dara Kerr that 
appeared in CNET News on January 2, 2013, six states have passed laws barring request s for social media 
passwords. These states include California, Delaware, Illinois,  Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey. 
Numerous cases have been brought before the National Labor Rela tions Board involving employer  
15 workplace policies pertaining to s ocial media. Courts and legis latures will increasingly dictate and clarify 
the extent to which employers have a right to access or monitor  employees’ social media activity or to 
limit employees’ speech on social media.  
Defamation  
Defamation, which is an untrue statement about a person, can be  written (libel) or oral (slander). A 
defamatory statement must be co mmunicated to a third person to give rise to a claim. A statement (written 
or oral) made by one person to  another does not constitute defa mation unless at least one other person 
becomes aware of the statement.  
Defamation claims most commonly arise during disputes following  employee terminations. In this 
situation, the employee will a llege that his or her professiona l reputation was damaged as a result of false 
comments made to colleagues by supervisors or managers followin g the termination.  
Defamation claims also arise when the former employer is asked to give a reference about the ex-
employee, and the former employer  provides derogatory informati on. (It is therefore recommended that 
employers only provide objective reference information that con firms the employer’s wage rate, dates of 
employment, and job requirements.)  
Less common are defamation claims that result when an employee is demoted or sanctioned in some other 
way on the basis of a false accusation by another employee. (Wh ile it should be recognized that truth can 
be a defense to defamation claims , even true statements or info rmation, if disclosed with malicious intent, 
can be valid grounds for a defamation claim.) 
Invasion of Privacy  
A number of situations produce invasion of privacy claims. Thes e include (a) intrusion into non-work-
related personal affairs; (b) intrusion into employee electroni c communications; (c) divulging of private 
information; (d) unreasonable sear ch of personal property/premi ses; and (e) negligent release of financial, 
identity-related data.  
Intrusion into Non-Work-Related Personal Affairs 
An employee can recover damages if an employer unreasonably int rudes into his or her personal affairs or 
when his or her termination is  based on lawful conduct that occ urred away from the workplace and had 
nothing to do with the employment itself. An employer could, ho wever, legally terminate an employee for 
a felony conviction if it could show that the conduct producing  that conviction was related to the nature of 
the employee’s job. For example, a school could likely terminat e a teacher who was convicted of 
indecency with a minor but not  necessarily if the conviction wa s for writing a bad check. 
Intrusion into Employee Electronic Communications   
In City of Ontario v. Quon , 130 S. Ct. 2619 (2010), a SWAT officer in Ontario, California , sued the city 
for invading his privacy by read ing personal e-mail messages on  his city-issued pager. Many of the 
messages were sent and received  during work hours. The plaintif f brought suit, despite having received 
the city’s “Computer Usage, Int ernet and E-Mail Policy” that ga ve the city “… the right to monitor and 
log all network activity includi ng e-mail and Internet use, wit h or without notice. Users should have no 
expectation of privacy or conf identiality when using these reso urces.” 
By an 8–1 majority, the US Supreme Court ruled that the City of  Ontario had a valid justification for 
searching Mr. Quon’s messages and had not violated his privacy.  However, the court declined to offer 
any specific guidelines as to w hat, exactly, constitutes a viol ation of an employee’s privacy as regards 
electronic communications.   
16 Divulging of Private Information 
Invasion of privacy claims can also arise if an employer divulg es information concerning the employee to 
third parties, even though the information is true. For example , employers may be found liable for 
providing information contained in an employee’s personnel file , medical records, or drug or polygraph 
test results.  
Unreasonable Search of Per sonal Property/Premises  
Other claims can involve unreasona ble searches of an employee’s  possessions or places where the 
employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Such claims a rise if the intrusion would be highly 
offensive to a “reasonable pers on.” In one case, an employer se arched an employee’s locker, which was 
secured with a personal lock. T he search was held to constitute  an invasion of privacy because the 
employer did not maintain a policy allowing access to the emplo yees’ lockers.  
Negligent Release of Financia l, Identity-Related Data  
One of the least considered sources of the data needed to commi t identity theft is records kept by 
corporate human resources (HR) departments. The misuse of such information creates a significant 
exposure for employers because victimized employees can claim t hat their privacy was violated and/or 
that the employer committed a b reach of confidentiality in allo wing such information to be accessible and 
subsequently misused. Liability for invasions of employee priva cy may also apply in situations where 
confidential employee data are obtained by electronic hacking. This is especially true in situations where 
it can be proven that the employer’s failure to take reasonable  preventive measures wa s the direct cause of 
the privacy breach.  
Fraud/Misrepresentation  
An employer may incur liability for unfounded promises made in forming the employment relationship.  
When Fraud/Misrepresentation Occurs 
A misrepresentation claim typically arises in two cases: (1) wh en an employee is rejected for a position 
with a new employer based on mi srepresentations made by his or her current employer during the 
reference checking process and (2 ) when an employee changes emp loyers based on the 
misrepresentations made by a pro spective employer, thereby leav ing an otherwise advantageous position.  
How Fraud/Misrepres entation Occurs 
Promises made during hiring nego tiations may form the basis for  a fraud or misrepresentation claim. To 
prevail under this cause of action, the employee must prove tha t (1) the employer made a false 
representation to the employee, (2) the employer knew that the representation was false or had the means 
or duty to know that it was false, and (3) the employee justifi ably relied on the misrepresentations to his 
or her detriment. In addition, as noted above, fraud/misreprese ntation may occur when statements or 
promises (e.g., a specific salary increase or promotion) are ma de to an existing employee as an 
inducement to remain with an orga nization, when, in fact the em ployer did not intend to honor such 
promises.  
Negligence  
Negligence is now a common claim type in the employment arena. Workplace-related negligence claims 
(as is true of all negligence cl aims) are based on the followin g four elements: (1) a duty owed, (2) a 
breach of that duty, and (3) dama ges (4) directly caused by a b reach of that duty. For instance, if an 
employer steadfastly refuses to provide an employee with protec tive equipment and the employee is 
injured as a direct result of such refusal, the employee (in ce rtain states) would have a valid claim of  
17 negligence against the employ er, because the employer breached a common law duty to provide a safe 
workplace and the employee was injured as a result.  
Negligent Hiring, Training, or Supervision 
Negligence claims often seek to  impose liability on an employer  for wrongful acts of supervisors or other 
employees, alleging that the employer negligently hired, traine d, or supervised an employee. Several 
negligent hiring cases have held th at employers have an affirma tive duty to investigate an applicant’s 
employment history to determine whether there is any reason not  to hire the applicant. These suits have 
usually arisen following incidents of violence or harassment, w herein the injured employee maintains that 
the employer knew—or should have  known—that another employee ha d a history of violence or sexual 
harassment in the workplace but failed to protect the other emp loyees.  
Negligent Retention 
Negligent retention cases arise wh en an employer fails to disch arge an employee who management knew 
or should have known had a propens ity toward violence or sexual  harassment, and that employee causes 
injury to another person. 
Intentional or Negligent Inflic tion of Emotional Distress  
Allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are  difficult to prove, because most states 
require the plaintiff to show extreme and outrageous conduct on  the part of the employer. States vary, 
however, on what constitutes “out rageous conduct,” so employers  should avoid any unnecessary behavior 
that would humiliate or embarrass an employee. 
Bullying 
Bullying is considered to involve  one person harassing another and is characterized by a pattern of 
deliberate, hurtful, and menacing behaviors repeated over time.  It can have the two following aspects. 
Physical —making intimidating physical t hreats, pushing, shoving, invadi ng an individual’s 
personal space 
Psychological —psychological violence that is mostly covert, including joking  or initiation rites 
that may mask sadistic behavior 
Other examples of bullying include the following. 
 Staring or glaring in a hostile manner  
 Treating another in a rude, demeaning, or disrespectful manner  
 Interfering with or sabotaging work activities  
 Shunning or otherwise giving someone the “silent treatment” 
 Failing to give or giving little  professional feedback on perfo rmance  
 Withholding of critical information necessary for work performa nce  
 Lying or misrepresentation rega rding workplace assignments, eve nts, or opportunities  
 Preventing or impeding an indi vidual from expressing himself or  herself 
Breach of an Employment Contract  
Employee allegations that an employer has breached the terms of  an employment agreement are of two 
basic types.   
18 Breach of a Written Employment Contract 
Claims asserting breach of a written contract are generally tri ggered by an employee’s termination, in 
which it is alleged that (a) the terms of the contract prohibit  termination without cause and (b) the 
employee’s termination was without sufficient cause. Such contr acts are almost always for a specific 
number of years, and compensation for that period is specifical ly indicated. 
As will be noted in the coverage  section of this course, virtua lly no EPL policies cover damages 
associated with written employment contracts, and only a handfu l cover defense costs involving 
assertions that an employer breach ed a written employment contr act. 
Breach of an Implied Employment Contract 
Claims asserting breach of an implied contract of employment us ually assert that a contract was 
established by an offer letter, s tatements in an employee handb ook, statements made by a 
manager/supervisor (often during an annual review), or as a res ult of an employee’s tenure with a 
company.  
As will be noted in the coverage  section of this course, most b ut not all EPL policies cover damages 
associated with implied employment contracts, and virtually all  cover defense costs involving such 
claims. 
Coercion  
Claims alleging coercion are those in which an employer attempt s to force an employee to engage in 
knowingly illegal conduct. For exa mple, this might involve a de mand that an employee provide testimony 
in a court of law that the employee knows to be false. Or coerc ion could take the form of pressuring an 
employee into intentional overb illing on a government contract.   
Wrongful Failure to Employ  
Such claims (which are also some times combined with discriminat ion claims) allege that an employer 
refused to hire an applicant who is qualified to perform a spec ific job.  
Wrongful Failure to Promote  
Claims alleging wrongful failure t o promote (which, again, are often combined with discrimination 
claims) assert that a qualified employee was denied a promotion . 
Wrongful Discipline  
Claims of wrongful discipline assert either that (1) an employe e was disciplined for an infraction that did 
not occur or, (2) if the employee did commit the infraction, th at the discipline meted out for the infraction 
was excessive.  
Wrongful Deprivation of a Career Opportunity  
Claims alleging wrongful deprivation of a career opportunity mo st often involve a failure to provide 
specific types of training that  will advance an employee’s care er. For example, if a first-line supervisor is 
not permitted to enroll in a cour se for managers, this could gi ve rise to such a claim.  
Wrongful Failure to Grant Tenure  
Wrongful failure to grant tenure claims are typically made in c ollege or university settings, whereby a 
professor claims to have been den ied tenure, despite having met  all of the requirements for tenure.   
19 Wrongful Failure to Grant a Partnership 
A similar type of allegation ma y be made against law, accountin g, or other professional firms, in which a 
claimant asserts that he/she w as wrongfully denied a partnershi p, despite having met all of the 
qualifications required for such  a position. (Note that coverag e for failure to make partner under EPLI 
policies, especially those written to cover professional firms,  is not always included within such policy 
forms and must therefore be adde d by endorsement if required.) 
Negligent Evaluation  
Negligent evaluation claims ass ert that an employee’s performan ce evaluation was excessively negative 
and therefore did not reflect the employee’s actual level of pe rformance.

23 Chapter 3 
Statutory Law EPL Exposures 
Overview 
Chapter 3 examines the key statut es that form the basis for a s ubstantial number of employment-related 
claims. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify key statutes that form the basis for many employment-r elated claims; 
 recognize the protections provide d to employees by various stat utes; and 
 given case information, determine the likely outcome of an EPL claim. 
In the United States, a great deal of employment-related litiga tion is brought under the federal statutes 
enacted to protect against discriminatory acts in the workplace , most significantly Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 (amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991), t he Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). All egations under these acts are often 
coupled with numerous individual state civil rights laws.  
A majority of states have also passed legislation similar to th ese federal laws. But for the sake of 
simplicity, this chapter will foc us on the federal statutes. Th e most important ones, noted below in Exhibit 
3.1, are discussed in the pages that follow. 
 
Exhibit 3.1 
Federal Statutes Relating to Workplace Discrimination 
 The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 
 The Equal Pay Act of 1963  
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  
 Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967) 
 The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978  
 The Worker Adjustment and Retrai ning Notification (WARN) Act o f 1988 
 The Civil Rights Act of 1871 (a s amended by the Civil Rights A ct of 1991)  
 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1992  
 Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA)  
 The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993  
 The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 
 The Genetic Information Nondisc rimination Act (GINA) of 2008 
  
24 The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
The FLSA requires most employers in the United States to comply  with minimum wage and hour 
standards. Often, comparable st ate laws apply requirements that  are even more str ingent. The FLSA’s 
basic requirements (1) govern the payment of overtime wages for  nonexempt employees (i.e., employees 
eligible for overtime pay) wor king more than 40 hours per workw eek, (2) specify employment limitations 
for children, and (3) mandate record keeping by employers. 
The two types of claims made under the FLSA are 
 misclassification claims and 
 pay practices claims. 
Both types of claims are referre d to as “wage and hour” claims.   
Misclassification Claims 
The FLSA established two broad classifications of employees, as  follows. 
 Exempt employees:  those ineligible for and, thus, “exempt” from receiving overti me pay  
 Nonexempt employees:  those not exempt from and, thus , eligible to receive overtime pay  
Misclassification claims center around one central question: wh ether an employer wrongly failed to pay 
overtime because the employer mistakenly classified an employee  as “exempt” and thus erroneously 
considered the employee inelig ible to receive overtime pay unde r the FLSA. 
Exempt versus Nonexempt Employees 
To be exempt from eligibility for overtime pay, employees must meet certain tests regarding job duties 
and responsibilities. They must a lso be compensated “on a salar y basis” at not less than stated amounts 
(according to individual state laws). Such tests, however, are highly confusing, and even workers paid on 
a salary basis can sometimes be eligible for overtime pay. Gene rally, salaried workers in managerial 
positions who earn more than the current federal threshold of $ 23,660 are exempt from receiving 
overtime pay. The Obama administr ation attempted to raise the t hreshold to $47,476 effective December 
1, 2016, but a federal judge blocked its implementation just be fore it was to take effect. As of this writing, 
the Labor Department is appealing the injunction. 
In addition, the following five categories of employees are “ex empt” from receiving overtime pay. 
1. Executives  
2. Administrative personnel  
3. Professionals  
4. Computer-related employees  
5. Outside sales employees  
A detailed explanation of these classifications is beyond the s cope of this course. To obtain such an 
explanation, go to the US Depa rtment of Labor’s website at ht tps://www.dol.gov .  
 
 
  
25 Pay Practices Claims 
One of the most pervasive misc onceptions regarding wage and hou r claims is that they are solely confined 
to “failure to pay overtime“ situ ations based on “exempt” versu s “nonexempt” misclassification errors (as 
explained above). In fact, the re are numerous additional causes  of wage and hour claims, which are 
termed “pay practices claims.” E xhibit 3.2 provides examples of  these claims.  
 
Exhibit 3.2  
Types of Pay Practices Claims  
 Misclassifying employees as  independent contractors  and not paying them overtime 
(since independent contractors ar e ineligible for overtime pay)   
 Not properly paying employees for overtime:  not paying compensation for hours worked 
in excess of 8 hours in a given day (the California standard, f or example) or more than 40 
hours in a week  
 Miscalculating the amount of wages owed:  applying the wrong rate, 
improperly/inaccurately crediting tips  
 Allowing employees to work “off the clock”:  not paying for time s pent for opening tasks 
or closing duties, before and a fter the official workday, or fo r time spent donning/doffing 
uniforms or equipment, or for attending seminars  
 Not allowing employees to take meal or rest breaks.  Notably, some state laws require 
an unpaid, 30-minute, uninterrupt ed meal period whenever the em ployee works 5 or more 
hours (with a second meal period  for workdays of 10 hours or lo nger). Such laws also 
mandate a paid 10-minute rest per iod for each 4 hours of work.  
 Not paying employees on a timely basis:  such as when an employer falls far behind in 
paying wages earned and thus owed  
 Not paying all wages due and owing at the time of termination. These delays could 
result in “waiting time” penalties so that the employee’s wages  continue to accrue each day 
he or she is paid late—up to 30 additional days.  
 Docking exempt employees’ salaries for absences

“Working off the Clock”: For What D uties Must Employees Be Paid ?  
One issue that frequently arises in conjunction with pay practi ces claims is the question whether 
employers are required to pay workers for tasks that do not dir ectly involve their actual job functions and 
yet are undeniably related to the nature of their work.  
The case of Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk,  135 S. Ct. 513 (U.S. 2014), which was decided by 
the US Supreme Court in December 2014, examined the question of  whether Integrity Staffing, a 
contractor for Amazon that supp lied workers who fulfilled order s at Amazon’s warehouses, was required 
to pay those workers for the tim e they spent waiting in line to  go through security screenings before going 
home. Because workers were sometimes required to wait for as lo ng as 25 minutes, counsel for the 
workers argued that they should be paid for such time. The US S upreme Court did not agree. Justice 
Clarence Thomas, writing for the Court’s 9–0 majority, noted th at “The screenings were not an intrinsic 
element of retrieving products from warehouse shelves or packag ing them for shipment,” which was the 
essence of the workers’ jobs.   
26 Despite the holding in this case , the question of whether an em ployer is required to pay its employees for 
activities not directly related to but nevertheless involving t heir work remains a situation/fact-based, 
rather than a rule-based, issue.  
In short, the problem for busin esses created by wage and hour e xposures is twofold. First, the provisions 
of the federal (FLSA) wage and ho ur law are extremely complex. Second, individual state variations on 
federal law make it even more di fficult to comply with the maze  of regulations that may be applicable in 
any given situation. 
Independent Contractor or Employee? 
Another type of pay practice claim may arise when an employer c lassifies its workers as independent 
contractors rather than employees. This “gig economy,” or “1099  economy,” named for the tax forms that 
independent contractors file in place of the W-2, has risen to prominence across many industries, with 
statistics from the US Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Divi sion showing that 10 percent to 30 
percent of employers may misclassify their workers as a result of their jobs being structured in this way. 
When workers are classified as em ployees rather than independen t contractors, additional costs for 
employers may include (a) income taxes, (b) Social Security and  Medicare taxes, (c) unemployment 
taxes, (d) workers compensati on, and (e) employee benefits, amo ng others. Additionally, an employer 
may be able to pass maintenance , insurance, gas, and other “upk eep” expenses on to workers that are 
classified as independent contractors rather than employees.  
When determining what makes a wo rker an employee or an independ ent contractor, the degree of control 
and independence between the empl oyer and worker is a crucial f actor. Different state and federal 
agencies have different tests to determine this, but a webinar from Strafford broke the control and 
independence factor into three general divisions: (1) behaviora l control, (2) financial control, and (3) 
relationship of parties.  
Court cases involving Uber, Lyft, FedEx, and Instacart have all  demonstrated how growth of the 1099 
economy will give rise to increasing numbers of misclassificati on allegations. 
The High Cost of Wage and Hour Claims 
Two key points should be recognized with regard to wage and hou r claims.  
First, they are, from a pure dollar standpoint, the costliest o f all types of employment-related claims. 
According to the Seyfarth Shaw Annual Workplace Class Action Li tigation Report (2016 Edition), the 
monetary value of the top 10 private plaintiff wage and hour cl ass action settlements entered into or paid 
in 2015 was $463.6 million, a significant increase from the top  10 settlements in 2014, which totaled 
$215 million, and in 2013, which  totaled $248.45 million. 
Second, coverage for wage and ho ur claims is excluded by standa rd EPLI policy forms. A handful of such 
policies do offer defense-only c overage for wage and hour claim s but only at relatively small limits 
($100,000 to $250,000) and on a sublimited basis. Several insur ers have begun writing wage and hour 
indemnity coverage, but they require high self-insured retentio ns, with $250,000 representing the lowest 
self-insured retention available and $1 million the most common  figure required by the small group of 
insurers that write wage and h our indemnity coverage. (The topi c of coverage for wag e and hour claims is 
addressed in more detail in Chapter 8 of this course.)  
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 
The Equal Pay Act prohibits pay discrimination against employee s because of their gender. The Act 
compels businesses to pay equal wa ges to employees performing “ substantially equal jobs,” regardless of 
the sex of the individual employ ees. “Substantially equal jobs”  means jobs that require equal skill, effort,  
27 and responsibility and that are p erformed under similar working  conditions. Pay differentials may be 
based on merit, seniority, or a ny lawful factor other than sex.   
Equal Pay Act Application 
The Equal Pay Act applies to a ll businesses regardless of the n umber of workers they employ.  
Damages Recoverable under Equal Pay Act  
The Equal Pay Act provides for the recovery of the difference i n pay, back pay, attorneys’ fees, and costs, 
had there not been a violation of the Act. If the court finds t hat the employer’s conduct was willful, it may 
double the damages award, unless the employer demonstrates that  it acted in a sincere and reasonable 
belief that its conduct was lawful . Also, awards generally are limited to 2 years’ back pay, but if the court 
determines that the violation w as willful, then the back pay aw ard may be extended to 3 years. 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act  of 1964, which was amended by  the Civil Rights Act of 1991, prohibits 
discrimination by private sector employers. The Civil Rights Ac t of 1991 broadened Title VII to allow 
aggrieved employees the right to a jury trial and the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages. 
Prior to the Civil Rights Act of  1991, successful claimants wer e entitled only to awards of back pay and 
benefits but not punitive damages or a jury trial. 
Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating on the basi s of race, color, religion, sex, or national 
origin in hiring, discharge, or compensation and with regard to  any terms, conditions, or privileges of 
employment.  
Title VII Application 
An “employer” is defined under Title VII as any person “engaged  in an industry affecting commerce who 
has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or 
preceding calendar year.” An “employer” can be a sole proprieto r, partnership, or corporation. A partner 
is not considered an employee un der Title VII. (Although Title VII only applies to employers with 15 or 
more workers, state or local laws against discrimination, depen ding on jurisdiction, may apply to 
employers of fewer workers.) 
Definition of “Agent”: Indivi dual Supervisor Liability  
The Title VII definition of “employer” also includes any “agent ” of the employer. For years, a debate has 
raged as to whether the inclusion of the term “agent” in the de finition of “employer” was meant to impose 
individual liability on supervisor s, including directors and of ficers. 
The Majority Rule 
The majority of federal courts, following the case of Miller v. Maxwell’s Int’l Inc. , 991 F.2d 583 (1993), 
do not interpret the term “agent” as creating individual liabil ity on the part of supervisors and directors 
and officers. Rather, the courts following Miller  have concluded that the term “agent” was included to 
ensure that an employer could be held liable for the acts of it s agents.  
The Minority Rule 
A minority of federal courts hol d that a supervisor may be pers onally liable for discriminatory acts. The 
leading case is Cross v. Alabama , 49 F.3d 1490 (11th Cir. 1995), w here the court ruled that sup ervisors 
who engage in discriminatory acts and who have actual authority  to hire and fire employees are 
“employers” themselves under Title VII and therefore are subjec t to personal liability.   
28 Religious Discrimination 
The federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as well as ma ny state and local laws and ordinances, 
prohibits discrimination against employees (or potential employ ees) because of their religion. This 
prohibition includes hiring, firing, and other terms and condit ions of employment (e.g., job assignment, 
compensation, etc.). Thus: 
 Employers may not treat employees or applicants more or less fa vorably than other employees 
because of their religion.  
 Employees cannot be forced to par ticipate in a religious activi ty as a condition of employment.  
 Employers must reasonably accommodate employees’ sincerely held  religious beliefs unless 
doing so would impose an undue burden on the company. 
 Employers must allow employees to  engage in religious expressio n if employees are permitted to 
engage in other personal expression at work unless the religiou s expression would impose an 
undue hardship on the employer.  
 Employers must take steps to pre vent religious harassment of th eir employees.  
“Reasonable Accommodation”: A Case Study 
The case of Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc.,  135 S. Ct. 2028 (U.S. 
2015), involved Samantha Elauf, a 17-year-old practicing Muslim , who applied and interviewed for a 
sales position at an Abercrombie store while wearing a head sca rf. 
At no time during the interview was she asked about either her religion or whether s he would wear a head 
scarf while working on the job (if she were to be hired). Ms. E lauf was later turned down for the position 
because the head scarf that she w ore to the interview conflicte d with Abercrombie’s Look Policy, which 
prohibited its salespeople from wearing “caps” or anything that  covered their heads. The EEOC brought a 
lawsuit on Ms. Elauf’s behalf, c laiming that she had been the v ictim of religious discrimination in 
violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
In finding for the plaintiff by an 8–1 majority, the US Supreme  Court held that it was not necessary for 
the plaintiff to prove that Abercrombie had actual knowledge  of the need to grant Ms. Elauf a religious 
accommodation. Rather, to make a v alid claim for religious disc rimination under Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, a plaintiff must only show that her need fo r an accommodation was a motivating 
factor  in a prospective employer ’s decision not to hire. 
Exceptions to the Law: When Religio us Discrimination Is “Legal”  
Despite the prohibition against religious discrimination in emp loyment, courts have recognized that 
religious organizations themsel ves, under the doctrine known as  the “ministerial exception,” do have the 
right to make employment decisions that conflict with local, st ate, and federal law prohibiting religious-
based discrimination (see Chapter 1). 
Gender Discrimination 
Under Title VII, it is unlawful to  discriminate against any emp loyee—or applicant—for employment 
because of his or her sex in rega rd to hiring, termination, pro motion, compensation, job training, or any 
other term, condition, or priv ilege of employment. Title VII al so prohibits employment decisions based 
on stereotypes and assumptions about abilities, traits, or the performance of individuals on the basis of 
sex. In addition, Title VII bars both intentional discriminatio n and neutral job policies that 
disproportionately exclude individuals on the basis of sex and that are not job related. 
There have been several important gender discrimination cases b rought against major corporations, 
including Home Depot, Morgan Stan ley, Boeing, Novartis, and Wal -Mart.  
29 The Home Depot Case  
On September 19, 1997, Home Depot agreed to pay $65 million in order to settle a class action gender 
discrimination case involving more than 25,000 women who worked  in or had applied to its West Coast 
Division stores. 
The Morgan Stanley Case  
On July 12, 2004, Morga n Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to c urrent and former female employees, all 
of whom were victims of sex discrimination. 
The Boeing Case  
On July 14, 2004, Boeing made an agreement, on similar grounds,  to pay up to $72.5 million. The 
ultimate size of the Boeing settlement is a function of the num ber of women who eventually submit 
claims. 
The Novartis Case  
On May 19, 2010, in Velez v. Novartis Corp. , No. 04 Civ. 9194 (S.D.N.Y.) , a federal jury in New York 
rendered what was, at the time, t he largest-ever verdict in a g ender discrimination case. The case against 
Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, which was originally filed  as a class action in 2005, was brought on 
behalf of 5,600 potential female  claimants. The verdict called for $250 million in punitive damages, along 
with $3.37 million in compensator y damages, payable to 12 forme r female sales representatives, the lead 
plaintiffs in the case. Following the jury’s verdict, a settlem ent was reached between the plaintiffs and 
Novartis in the amount of $152 million, plus approximately $22 million in special programs aimed at 
changing the employment practices and cultural attitudes at the  company to eliminate gender 
discrimination. About $60 million of the settlement was earmark ed to cover back pay. The verdict was 
also noteworthy because it marked  the first time that a class a ction gender discrimination claim was tried 
to a verdict. 
The Wal-Mart Case: The Largest G ender Discrimination Case to Da te  
The case of Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , 603 F.3d 571 (2010), is the largest sex discrimination class 
action suit of all time. It began in 2000, when Betty Dukes, a 54-year-old Wal-Mart hourly worker in 
California, brought a sex discrim ination claim against the comp any. She alleged that, after 6 years of 
favorable job performance, she was denied the training she need ed to advance to a higher, salaried 
position. In June 2001, Ms. Dukes became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought before the US District 
Court in San Francisco that sought to represent 1.6 million wom en, including all those who currently 
work or had previously worked in  a Wal-Mart store since Decembe r 26, 1998. The suit claimed that Wal-
Mart discriminated against women  in promotions, pay, and job as signments, all of which violated Title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
After the Ninth Circuit Court had twice affirmed the (lower) fe deral district court’s initial decision in 
favor of the plaintiff-workers, Wal-Mart appealed to the US Sup reme Court. In June 2011, the Court held 
that the nationwide class of 1.6 million women who had worked f or Wal-Mart and alleged gender 
discrimination against the reta iler was unsustainable. Rather t han assess the extent to which they were 
subjected to gender discrimination, in a 5–4 ruling, the Court rejected the claim based on the finding that 
the class action format was invalid on two major grounds. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 131 S. Ct. 
2541 (2011). 
First, whatever discrimination may have been committed was eith er store and/or manager-specific  and 
therefore did not emanate from specific direction  provided by the company’s top management. In the 
Court’s view, this disqualifie d the case from fitting within th e requisite class action format.  
30 Second, the Court found that, since the plaintiffs held widely varying positions requi ring very different 
job duties (i.e., from cashiers to store managers), they did no t suffer a common injury  as is required under 
the rules for bringing class actions. 
Procedural Hurdles to Future Empl oyment Class Actions: The Wal-Mart 
Precedent   
The effect of the Wal-Mart case, in terms of procedural hurdles  inherent in class actions, has been so 
significant that the 2013 editi on of the “Annual Workplace Clas s Action Report,” published by the law 
firm of Seyfarth Shaw, had the following to say about its conse quences. 
... Wal-Mart  influenced settlement strategies in workplace class actions in  a profound way. 
Employers settled fewer employment discrimination class actions  than at any time over the past 
decade and at a fraction of the  levels as in 2006 to 2011. This  reflected the impact of Wal-Mart , 
and the notion that difficulties in certifying nationwide, mass ive class actions impaired the ability 
of the plaintiffs’ bar to convert their case filings into block buster settlements. It also manifested 
the ability of defendants to dis mantle large class cases, or to  devalue them for settlement 
purposes. Simply stated, Wal-Mart  aided employers to defeat, fracture, and/or devalue 
employment discrimination class actions, and resulted in fewer settlements at lower amounts. 
The Report went on to note that the monetary value of the top 1 0 private plaintiff discrimination 
settlements agreed to or paid in 2012 totaled $48.65 million. T his represents a substantial drop from 
2011—the year in which the Wal-Mart case was decided—during which th e top 10 settlements totaled 
$123.3 million. 
Expansion of Gender Discriminati on Expanded to Include Sexual O rientation 
Discrimination 
On March 1, 2016, the EEOC published a press release announcing  the filing of its first two 
gender/sexual discrimination cases (under Title VII) based on s exual orientation. Although lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender issues had already been established a s a priority in the EEOC’s Strategic 
Enforcement Plan for fiscal years 2013–2016, the filing of thes e two lawsuits represents a significant 
development and reinforces the EEOC’s stated agenda with concre te legal action.  
These two lawsuits might also indicate that the EEOC could furt her extend the scope of its gender 
discrimination allegations to in clude discrimination on the bas is of sexual orientation (although no cases 
of that nature have yet been filed).  
Race Discrimination 
Title VII protects employees against employment discrimination on the basis of race and color, as well as 
national origin, sex, or religion. 
It is unlawful to discriminate against any employee—or applican t for employment—because of race or 
color in regard to hiring, termi nation, promotion, compensation , job training, or any other term, condition, 
or privilege of employment.  
Title VII prohibits both intentional discrimination and neutral  job policies that disproportionately exclude 
minorities and that are not job related. 
   
31 Potential Damages  
Successful Title VII claimants can receive reinstatement or fro nt pay (i.e., future wages); back pay (i.e., 
past wages); attorneys’ fees; an injunction against the prohibi ted discrimination; damages for pain, 
suffering, and mental anguish; and punitive damages. 
Damages for pain, suffering, men tal anguish, and punitive damag es are available only to victims of 
intentional discrimination and are subject to the following cap s, based on the size of the employer’s 
workforce.  
15 to 100 employees $50,000 
101 to 200 employees $100,000 201 to 500 employees $200,000 
501 employees or more $300,000 
In cases involving multiple claimants, each successful claimant  is subject to a separate cap. The above 
caps do not affect the amount of back pay, front pay, attorneys ’ fees, or interest on back pay that a 
successful claimant may collect. 
Effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 
This Act broadened claimants’ rights under Title VII. While pre viously limited to a bench trial (i.e., a trial 
before a judge), as a result of this law, plaintiffs now have t he right to have their case heard by a jury. 
Jury trials potentially increase an employer’s exposure, becaus e most juries tend to identify with and, 
thus, favor the employee and generally award larger verdicts th an do judges. 
ADEA of 1967 
The ADEA of 1967 bars employers from discriminating against emp loyees over the age of 40 on the basis 
of age with regard to hiring, d ischarge, compensation, and othe r terms, conditions, or privileges of 
employment. Under the ADEA, empl oyers are prohibited from (1) f ailing or refusing to hire, discharging, 
or discriminating in the compensation of an individual because of age; (2) depriving an individual of 
employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affecting the e mployee’s status because of age; or (3) 
reducing an individual’s wages to eliminate a wage discrepancy that might violate the ADEA. Employers 
may not retaliate against an employee for asserting rights prot ected by the ADEA or publish any notice or 
advertisement that expresses any age preference or limitation. As with Title VII and the ADA, a majority 
of courts hold that there is no individual personal liability f or supervisors under the ADEA.  
ADEA Application 
The ADEA protects workers employed in a business that has 20 or  more employees for each working day 
for 20 or more calendar weeks in the year. One exception to the  ADEA is the compulsory retirement of 
bona fide executives or “high policy makers” at age 65 or over.  A “high policy making position” is 
limited to upper-level employees who are “individuals with litt le or no line authority but who play a 
significant role in developing corporate policy.  
Potential Damages  
Successful plaintiffs under the ADEA are entitled to back pay, benefits, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs, 
and front pay if they are not reinstated. If the employer is fo und to have willfully violated the ADEA, the 
wronged employee is also entitled to liquidated damages in an a mount equal to the award for back pay 
and benefits. In this instance, liquidated damages refers to th e actual amount of wages lost from the time  
32 of the wrongful termination based on age discrimination until a djudication of the claim by a court or by a 
settlement.  
“But for” Causation: The Require d Standard of Proof under the ADEA 
The key case establishing the all- important standard of proof i n age discrimination cases was the US 
Supreme Court’s decision in Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs. Group, Inc., 200 U.S. 321, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. 
Ed. 2d 119 (2009).  
The plaintiff in this case, Jack Gross, alleged that he was dem oted on account of his age in violation of the 
ADEA. In a 5–4 decision, the US Supreme Court held that a plain tiff bringing an ADEA claim must 
prove that age was the “but-for” cause of the challenged advers e employment action—not merely one 
factor among many that motivated the adverse employment action.  In other words, unless a plaintiff could 
prove that age was the overriding cause for an adverse employer  action, the claim would not be actionable 
under the ADEA. For example, an employer would still have a val id defense to an ADEA claim if the 
employer could prove that the employee’s poor performance—rathe r than his age—was the overriding 
cause of his termination—despite the fact that a plaintiff prov ided evidence that derogatory comments had 
been made about his age.  
PDA of 1978 
In a 1978 amendment to Title V II, the PDA brought “pregnancy, c hildbirth, or related medical 
conditions” within the purview  of “sex” as a characteristic pro tected by Title VII. This legislation created 
a new “protected class”—pregnant  women—and gave them the right to bring claims for discrimination 
under Title VII. The PDA allows a p regnant woman to recover equ itable (i.e., job reinstatement following 
termination) and compensatory r elief (and, at times, punitive d amages) to remedy acts of discrimination 
on the part of her employer. 
Protections Included Within the Act 
The following are included w ithin the Act’s protections. 
1. Hiring. An employer cannot refuse to hire a pregnant woman beca use of (1) her pregnancy; (2) a 
pregnancy-related condition; or (3) the prejudices of coworkers , clients, or customers. 
2. Pregnancy and Maternity Leave. An employer may not single out p regnancy-related conditions 
for special procedures to determi ne an employee’s ability to wo rk.  
3. Health Insurance. Any health insurance provided by an employer must cover expenses for 
pregnancy-related conditions on the same basis as costs for oth er medical conditions. 
4. Fringe Benefits:  Pregnancy-Related Benefits Canno t Be Limited to Married Employ ees. In 
an all-female workforce or job classification, benefits must be  provided for pregnancy-related 
conditions if benefits are provi ded for other medical condition s. 
5. Anti-Retaliation. It is also unlaw ful to retaliate against an i ndividual for opposing employment 
practices that discriminate based on pregnancy or for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or 
participating in any liti gation under Title VII. 
Accommodations for Pregnant Workers 
The issue in Young v. UPS , 135 S. Ct. 1338 (U.S. 2015), involved the question of whether , under the 
PDA, employers must afford the same job accommodations to an em ployee with a pregnancy-related 
work limitation as they do to the ir employees with similar but non-pregnancy-related work limitations. 
When plaintiff Peggy Young, a de livery driver employed by Unite d Parcel Service, became pregnant in 
2006, she was advised by her medi cal practitioner not to lift m ore than 20 pounds. Yet, because her job  
33 required her to lift up to 70 pounds, she sought a lighter-duty  accommodation from her employer. The 
request was denied, and she was placed on unpaid leave. 
By a vote of 6–3, the Court concluded that the PDA did intend t o prohibit employers from treating 
pregnant workers less favorably than nonpregnant workers. Thus,  when the pregnant workers have similar 
limitations in their ability to perform certain types of work ( as nonpregnant workers), an employer is 
obligated under the PDA to provi de accommodations at least as f avorable as those ordinarily offered to 
other workers. 
The Worker Adjustment and Retr aining Notification (WARN) Act of  
1988 
The WARN Act requires certain employers (any private-sector or not-for-profit employer with 100 or 
more full-time employees) to provide their employees with writt en notice of a planned mass layoff or 
plant closing, so that workers may seek alternative employment prior to the layoff. In addition, a number 
of individual states have laws w ith a similar intent that super sede the WARN Act, typically in a more 
liberal fashion. 
The law applies to both hourly and salaried employees, includin g those in managerial and supervisory 
positions. However, it does not appl y to employees who have wor ked for less than 6 months and those 
who work less than 20 hours per week. 
What Events Trigger a Requirement to Notify Employees? 
Three events trigger the requirement to provide employees with a 60-day notice period prior to an 
“employment loss”: a plant closi ng, a mass layoff, or a cumulat ive layoff. 
 Plant Closing.  An employer is required to give 60 days’ notice if an employme nt site will be shut 
down, resulting in the loss of employment for 50 or more worker s, during any 30-day period. 
 Mass Layoff.  An employer is required to giv e 60 days’ notice if there will be a mass layoff that 
does not involve a plant closing but will result in (1) the los s of jobs at an employment site during 
any 30-day period for 500 or mor e employees or (2) the loss of employment for 50 to 499 
employees if they comprise at least 33 percent of the employer’ s workforce. 
 Cumulative Layoff.  An employer is required to give workers 60 days’ notice if, du ring a 30-day 
period, the number of jobs lost for 2 or more groups of workers , each of which is less than the 
minimum number needed to trigger notice, would reach the minimu m threshold if they were 
combined during any 90-day peri od. Job losses with in any 90-day  period will count together 
cumulatively. 
What Are the Exceptions to the Law? 
The three major exceptions to th e 60-day notice requirement are  as follows. 
 Faltering Company.  In situations where a company  has sought new capital or new bu siness in 
order to stay open and where gi ving notice of mass layoffs woul d prevent the firm from obtaining 
the new capital or business, the notice requirement is waived. 
 Unforeseen Circumstances.  This exception applies when the re are business circumstances t hat 
were not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice would otherw ise have been required. For 
example, if the firm’s largest c ustomer from which it generates  one-third of its annual sales 
suddenly transfers all of its business to a competitor, such a situation would fall under the 
unforeseen circumstances exception. 
 Natural Disaster.  This exception applies where a plant closing or mass layoff is  the direct result 
of a natural disaster, such as a  hurricane, flood, or earthquak e.  
34 The ADA 
The ADA forbids employers from discriminating against a “qualif ied individual” with a “disability” when 
the discrimination is based on the individual’s disability. A “ qualified individual” is “an individual with a 
disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can p erform the essential functions of the 
employment position that such individual holds or desires.”  
ADA Application 
The ADA applies to employers with 15 or more employees who are employed for the current or 
preceding year for 20 or more cal endar weeks. As with Title VII , the majority rule is that there is no 
individual liability under the ADA. 
The ADA imposes two broad requirements: (1) equal opportunity a nd (2) reasonable accommodation.  
Equal Opportunity 
Equal opportunity compels an empl oyer to hire a job applicant, regardless of any disab ility, provided he 
or she possesses the requisite sk ills, education, and experienc e to handle the duties of the position. 
Definition of “Disability” 
The ADA defines “disability” as (1) a physical or mental impair ment that substantially limits one or more 
of the major life activities of an individual, (2) a record of such an impairment, or (3) the perception that 
an individual has an impairment . The ADA extends the term “disa bility” to diseases such as epilepsy, 
tuberculosis, and AIDS but does not protect individuals with ad dictions to controlled substances. 
Employers, however, may bar i ndividuals with specified contagio us diseases (not including AIDS) from 
handling or preparing food. 
Reasonable Accommodation 
An employer is obligated to pr ovide “reasonable accommodation” that will allow disabled employees to 
perform essential job functions. An employer is required to mak e “reasonable accommodations” for a 
disabled employee or applicant if doing so imposes no “undue ha rdship” on the employer.  
These accommodations must be provided in three areas: (1) to pe rmit an employee to perform the 
essential functions of the job, ( 2) to create fairness in testi ng and applications procedures, and (3) to 
permit a disabled individual to enjoy the benefits and privileg es of employment that are at least 
substantially equal to those bene fits and privileges afforded t o similarly situated nondisabled individuals.  
Examples of “Reasonable Accommodation” 
Examples of “reasonable accommodation” include making offices a ccessible to persons with disabilities, 
modifying job descriptions, providing flexible work schedules, reassignment, or other workplace 
adjustments that the employer can accomplish without undue hard ship.  
Potential Damages  
A plaintiff filing suit under the ADA has the right to demand a  jury trial. A successful claimant under the 
ADA may obtain reinstatement; b ack pay and benefits; attorneys’  fees; expert witness fees; damages for 
pain, suffering, and mental anguish; and punitive damages. Comp ensatory and punitive damage awards 
are subject to the same caps as Title VII claims. However, if t he employer, in good faith and in 
consultation with the disabled employee, attempts to identify a nd make a reasonable accommodation, the 
court may not award compensatory and punitive damages. In its d iscretion, the court may order an 
employer to afford an employee a reasonable accommodation. 35 The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) 
In an effort to clarify questions regardin g what co nstitutes a “disability,” effective January 1, 2009, a 
number of chan ges to the ADA were en acted b y a law known as the ADAA A. Two  of the more imp ortant 
changes inv olve mitigatin g measur es and expan sion of major life act ivities.  
Mitigating Measures 
The changes brought by the ADAAA reject recent Supreme Court p recedent, which ho lds that “mitig ating 
measures” (e.g.,  medications, pro sthetics, corrective surgery, hearing aids) are to be considered in  
assessing wheth er an individual is cov ered under the ADA. Rather, the ADAAA holds that impairments 
are to be evaluated in their unm itigated state when determining whether the individual is substantially 
limited in a majo r life activity  (except th at ord inary eyeglass es and con tact lenses may be considered).  
Expansion of Major Life Activ ities 
ADAAA also added several new activ ities to th e list of major li fe activities covered by the statute, 
including: “sleeping, . . . concentrating, thinking, [and] co mmunicating.” Also included as major life 
activities are “the operatio n of major bodily fu nctions” such as the “immu ne system, normal cell growth, 
digestive,  bowel, bladder, neuro logical, brain, respirato ry, ci rculatory, endocrine and reproductive 
functions.” All of these new major life activities create additional factors that employers will have to 
consider when making employment decisions.  
The FMLA of 1993 
The FMLA of 1993 allows employees , in certain circumstan ces, to take unpaid leave from work to care 
for themselves or clo se family members (i.e., parent, child, bu t not first cousin). 
Application of FMLA  
The Act requires businesses with 50 or more employees to provid e up to 12 week s of unpaid, job-
protected leav e to eligible employees for qualified family and medical emergencies. An employee is 
eligible only if (1) th e employer has at least 50 employees wit hin a 75-mile radius of the employee’s 
worksite; (2) he or she has worked for any  covered employer for a min imum of 1 year; and (3) the 
emplo yee has worked  for his or her current employer for a minim um of 1,250 hours during the p receding 
year. 
An employee seeking leave is required to prov ide 30 days’ advance notice to his or her employer wh en 
the leave is foreseeable, such as for childb irth or adop tion. T he employer can ask  that the employee 
comply  with t he compan y’s standard procedure for obtaining leave, although medical leave may not be 
denied because th e employee fails to follow the pro per p rocedur es. 
The Problem of Intermittent Leave 
Under the law, emplo yees are allowed to take what is known as intermittent leave. According to 
Department of Labor regulations , an employee can potentially  take leave in increments as brief as 1 5 
minutes per day. HR professionals ro utinely cite this as one of the greatest challenges under the Act—
first, because tracking intermittent leave is so tedious and, s econd, because it has the poten tial to  disru pt 
scheduling and work flow within  a business if employees take re peated leaves of such short du rations.  
Chronic Conditions 
Anoth er intermittent leave challe nge is dealing  with chronic co nditions such  as diabetes, migraine 
headaches, depression, and  asthma, whereby an emp loyee typicall y requests leave without prior notice 
and for only a brief p eriod of time (e.g., a h alf hour to  lie d own during a migraine h eadache).   
36 Many HR executives have purchased software programs that track FMLA leave time or have such 
programs built into their HR management systems.  
Damages Recoverable under FMLA  
Employees may enforce their rights under the FMLA in federal co urt or through the US Department of 
Labor and, if successful, may recei ve money damages and attorne ys’ fees and cash, as well as equitable 
relief, including reinstatement a nd promotion. Even an employee  who has not suffered any lost wages 
because of a violation may recover monetary damages sustained a s a direct result of the violation, such as 
child care or nursing care up to a sum equal to 12 weeks of pay . The court may double damages if it finds 
that the employer intentionally violated the FMLA. 
USERRA of 1994 
USERRA, which was signed into law on October 13, 1994, is inten ded to minimize the disadvantages to 
an individual that occur when tha t person needs to be absent fr om his or her civilian employment to serve 
in this country’s uniformed services. Specifically, USERRA prov ides for a cumulative 5-year time period 
during which a person may be absent from work for uniformed ser vices duty and retain reemployment 
rights.  
USERRA Application 
A key point associated with USERRA is that all employers are su bject to it—regardless of their size.  
What Is the Magnitude of the Exposure? 
Admittedly, a low percentage of situations involving the assert ion of USERRA rights ends up in court. 
Nevertheless, given the fact t hat, since 2001, roughly half a m illion people have served in Middle East 
military operations, and given th e sheer number of potential pl aintiffs such operations have created, the 
magnitude of the exposure cannot be ignored.  
The Purpose of USERRA 
The law attempts to encourage noncareer uniformed service (i.e. , in the National Guard and Reserves), so 
that America can enjoy the pr otection of those services, staffe d by qualified people, while balancing the 
needs of private and public employers that also depend on these  same individuals.  
Who Is Covered by USERRA? 
USERRA potentially covers every individual in the country who s erves or has served in the uniformed 
services. The Act applies to employers in the public and privat e sectors, including federal employers. The 
term “uniformed service s” means the Armed F orces, the Army Nati onal Guard, and the Air National 
Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty t raining, or full-time National Guard duty; 
the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service; and any ot her category of persons designated by the 
president in time of war or emergency. 
    
  
37 Employee Eligibility 
To be eligible for USERRA rights, employees must 
1. have held a civilian job prior to their service in the uniforme d services,  
2. have given notice to their employer that they were leaving the job for uniformed service,  
3. have been in uniformed service for no longer than a cumulative total of 5 years during their 
employment,  
4. not be released from uniformed ser vice under dishonorable or ot her punitive conditions, and  
5. apply for reemployment within specified time limits after retur n.  
Advance Notice Requirements 
The law requires all employees to  provide their e mployers with advance notice of military service. This 
advance notice includes a reasonable time period with which to leave for home to prepare for service.  
An Employee’s Rights upon Returning to Work 
The rights to which returning employees are entitled under the USERRA are subject to the “escalator 
principle.” This principle requires returning employees to be t reated as if they had been continuously 
employed. They must be reemployed in the job that they would ha ve attained had they not been absent for 
uniformed service. This may require that the employer train the  returning employee to enable him or her 
to function in a new position. Ret urning employees must also re ceive the seniority, status, pay, and other 
benefits to which they would hav e been entitled had they not go ne on leave. 
An employer is not required to reemploy a service man or woman when (1) the employer experiences 
“changed circumstances” that would make reemployment impossible  or unreasonable (such as layoffs that 
would have included the employee , for example) and (2) when the re is “undue hardship.”  
GINA of 2008 
The GINA is designed to prohibit the improper use of genetic in formation in health insurance and 
employment. The Act, which became effective November 21, 2009, prohibits group health plans and 
health insurers from denying cove rage to a healthy individual o r charging that person higher premiums 
based solely on a genetic predi sposition to developing a diseas e in the future. The legislation also bars 
employers from using individuals ’ genetic information when maki ng hiring, firing, job placement, or 
promotion decisions. The law applies to all employers, regardle ss of size of the workforce.  
GINA: A Claim Scenario 
A company requires preemployment physicals as a condition of em ployment. The results of a prospective 
employee’s physical indicate that s he is healthy and fully capa ble of performing the job duties of the 
particular position for which she applied. However, during the course of the examination, it is also 
revealed that she has a genetic predisposition to developing br east cancer. As a result of the law, the 
employer would not be able to deny the person the job, despite such a predisposition.  
Confidentiality of “Genetic Information” 
Under GINA, it is also unlawful for a business to disclose gene tic information about applicants, 
employees, or members. Businesses must keep genetic information  confidential and in a separate medical 
file. There are six narrow excep tions to the confidentiality ru le, as follows.  
 Inadvertent Acquisition of Genetic Information . (E.g., a manager or supervisor overhears 
someone talking about a family member’s illness.)   
38  As Part of Health or Wellness Programs . Genetic information may be acquired by the 
employer if it is offered by the employee on a voluntary basis.   
 Certification for FMLA Leave . Family medical history may be obtained in the event an 
employee is asking for leave to care for a family member with a  serious health condition.  
 Commercially and Publicly  Available Documents . Genetic information may be acquired 
through sources like newspapers, provided the employer is not a ctively searching those sources 
(e.g., websites and online discussion groups that focus on issu es such as genetic testing of 
individuals and genetic  discrimination).  
 Genetic Monitoring Programs.  Genetic information may be acqui red if such information is use d 
to monitor the biological effects of toxic substances in the wo rkplace and where such monitoring 
is required by law.  
 Forensic Testing Programs . Genetic information of employees may be obtained by employers  
that engage in DNA testing for law enforcement purposes (e.g., as a forensic lab) or for purposes 
of human remains identification . But the genetic information ma y only be used for analysis of 
DNA markers for quality control an d detection of sample contami nation. 
Liability under State and Local Statutes 
Aggrieved employees also can seek protection under state and lo cal antidiscrimination statutes similar to 
the federal statutes discussed above, including fair employment  practices laws and whistleblower statutes. 
Fair Employment Practices Laws  
Every state has enacted fair employment practices legislation, which bars discrimination by private 
employers against defined categories of individuals. The fair e mployment practices laws are broader than 
their federal counterparts but are not uniform in their protect ion. For example, several states protect 
marital status, and a small but growing number of states protec t sexual orientation. Since local fair 
employment laws are typically broader than corresponding federa l statutes, they have the effect of 
subjecting small businesses to lo cal laws, even though federal statutes do not bind them. Therefore, 
aggrieved employees may be more inclined to bring claims under local laws.  
Whistleblower Statutes  
The federal government protects employees from retaliatory acti ons by their employers when the 
employees report violations of any law on the part of their emp loyers. Many states also have passed laws 
prohibiting an employer from firing or otherwise retaliating ag ainst an employee for disclosing an unfair 
or illegal practice by the employer.  
Public Policy Protection 
Many state courts have created common law remedies that protect  employees from termination or 
retaliation for exercising their legal rights. Employees discha rged or retaliated against for exercising their 
rights may sue their employer for damages. Courts generally jus tify this exception to the at-will 
employment rule on the basis of “public policy,” holding that a n employee should not be discharged for 
exercising rights under other laws that were enacted to protect  the employee.

42 Chapter 4 
Rating and Underwriting EPL Coverage 
Overview 
Chapter 4 discusses the factors that are considered in developi ng rates for EPLI coverage. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify and prioritize the fact ors used in developing rates fo r EPLI policies,  
 recognize the characteristics of an EPLI applicant that underwr iters consider desirable and those 
that are considered undesirable, and  
 identify the rationale behind EPLI underwriting evaluations.  
The Rating Basis for EPLI Policies 
EPLI policies are generally rated on a cost “per employee” basi s. To develop a total premium, 
underwriters first determine a “per employee” rate and then mul tiply it by the number of covered 
employees under the policy.  
The factors used in developing rates for EPLI policies are note d in Exhibit 4.1 and explained in the pages 
that follow. In addition, these fa ctors are used as modifiers t hat are applied to such rates in determining a 
final premium.  
Exhibit 4.1 
EPL Rating and Modification Factors 
 Jurisdiction  
 Number and Dispersion of Locations 
 Industry  
 Number of employees  
 Leased employees 
 Union employees 
 Profitability  
 Mix of exempt/nonexempt employees  
 Claim history  
 Written HR procedures  
 Termination and turnover rates  
 Plans for staff reductions and layoffs  
 Corporate culture   
43 Jurisdiction 
Location is the single most im portant factor affecting premiums , given the disparity in claim 
susceptibility and severity from stat e to state. (Accordingly, application forms almost always request a 
breakdown of the number of emplo yees in each state of operation .) Substantial jury verdicts have been 
recorded in California (where more than one-third of all EPL cl aims are made), Illinois, Michigan, New 
Jersey, and Texas. In contrast, states such as West Virginia, K ansas, and New Hampshire exhibit 
relatively low EPL claim frequency and severity.  
In addition to charging rates re flecting varying potential freq uency and severity, underw riters also require 
differing minimum retentions/deductibles, depending on the spec ific jurisdiction involved. For example, 
one leading insurer applies a mi nimum $75,000 per claim retenti on/deductible to Southern California-
based risks, a figure reflecting the higher severity of EPL cla ims in this jurisdiction. 
Number and Dispersion of Locations 
Underwriters also consider the number and dispersion of locatio ns at which an insured operates. This is 
an important factor because the g reater the geographical disper sion of its operations, the more difficult it 
is for a business to implement and monitor loss prevention and control policies. Therefore, geographically 
dispersed firms pose a greater risk of claim frequency and seve rity (than do single-location businesses) 
and are surcharged accordingly.  
Industry 
Industry is another important factor affecting EPL policy premi ums. Firms in certain industries are more 
susceptible to being sued and subjected to substantial judgment s. For example, restaurants pay a higher 
premium rate per employee, compa red with most other industries,  given the restaurant industry’s higher-
than-average rate of se xual harassment claims. 
Number of Employees 
Not only does the number of emplo yees working at a business pro vide an indication of the number of 
potential plaintiffs, but the si ze of a company’s workforce is also significant because larger organizations 
are more likely to be sued than smaller ones. There are three r easons for this.  
Higher Standards of Claim Prevention 
First, courts tend to hold larger  firms to higher standards of claim prevention, compared to smaller 
organizations. The thinking is that such firms have greater fin ancial ability to implement fair employment 
practices and should therefore be  held to a higher standard, co mpared to smaller, less financially solid 
companies.  
Deeper Pockets 
Second, plaintiff’s attorneys often target larger firms when th ey file lawsuits for two reasons: first, 
because they are more likely than  smaller companies to be insur ed, thus providing a source of settlement 
proceeds, and, second, even if not  insured (or insured with a h igh retention), larger companies have the 
kinds of deep pockets that enc ourage juries to award sizeable s ettlements or verdicts. 
Similarly Situated Employees 
Third, larger firms have greater numbers of similarly situated employees. For example, a Fortune 500 
firm is more likely to employ 1,000 workers in a single plant, doing the same or similar job, than will a 
smaller firm. This makes larger firms more vulnerable to class- action (i.e., multiple plaintiff) claims, 
which have historically yielded a number of large settlements a nd judgments against m ajor corporations.   
44 Leased Employees 
Underwriters are also interested in knowing the number of lease d employees maintained by a company. 
Depending on the terms of the lease(s) under which leased emplo yees work, an insured may or may not 
be responsible for maintaining EPLI on such personnel. In cases  where the insured must purchase such 
coverage according to the terms of a leasing agreement, the und erwriter will add leased employees to the 
“head count” used to develop a premium for the policy. (Typical ly, the rate per leased employee is one-
third the rate per regular employee.) 
Union Employees 
The number of union employees working at a business is also an important underwriti ng consideration. 
This is because union workers are more likely to make a claim t han nonunion workers are, since the 
former are more “sensitized” to  possible causes of action, base d upon input from union shop stewards. 
However, this factor is somewhat offset by the fact that most E PL forms exclude claims associated with 
grievances related to union cont racts. In addition, agreements between union representatives (i.e., shop 
stewards) and the employer often resolve many minor disputes—wi thout lawsuits.  
Profitability 
An employer’s profitability is a key underwriting consideration . Since employees are frequently 
terminated for financial rathe r than performance reasons (as is  the case during layoffs), firms in 
questionable financial condition are much more susceptible to w rongful termination claims compared to 
companies that have strong earnings. Thus, financially weaker c ompanies often have to pay more for 
EPLI coverage than do those on firmer financial footing.  
When evaluating a company’s pr ofitability, underwriters conside r a number of specific factors.  
 Working Capital.  A firm with ample working cap ital is typically in a better pos ition to avoid 
layoffs, compared to one with less available cash, particularly  during economic downturns. Firms 
lacking such capital may be forced  to lay off workers when earn ings drop significantly, despite 
the fact that they intend to rehire them when conditions improv e. In contrast, better capitalized 
companies are not necessarily forced into layoffs during slack periods.  
 Financial Ratios.  Underwriters also look at key f inancial ratios (e.g., return o n equity ratio, 
current ratio, profit margin). S uch data also enable an underwr iter to assess a firm’s likelihood of 
experiencing financial distress a nd consequent layoffs. This is  especially true if the trends of such 
ratios are analyzed. (I.e., are the ratios improving or deterio rating?) 
 Age of Firm.  In situations where an insured or applicant for coverage does not show a profit for 
its most recent year, the underwr iter often considers the numbe r of years the company has been in 
business. In the case of a relatively “young” firm (i.e., less than 5 years of operating history), if 
losses have been decreasing, this is a positive sign, which enh ances the firm’s insurability. In fact, 
providing coverage for an establis hed firm that is beginning to  lose money is often more 
problematic than offering coverage to a newer company that has been experiencing losses for 
some time but is starting to stabilize financially and therefor e does not anticipate future layoffs. 
Mix of Exempt and Nonexempt Employees 
A high percentage of exempt employees (i.e., those exempt from being eligible to receive overtime pay) 
increases the potential severity a nd frequency of claims and th us the rate per employee. Exempt 
employees are likely to earn higher salaries than are nonexempt  employees (i.e., those eligible to receive 
overtime pay), thus producing larger income loss following term ination. (Sometimes, underwriters apply 
a separate rate for exempt and nonexempt employees.) In additio n, since exempt employees tend to be  
45 more educated and thus more aware of their rights, they are als o more likely to bring claims than are 
nonexempt workers. 
Exempt Employees and the “Reemployment” Factor  
Exempt employees (especially those who are highly compensated) also have an increased likelihood of 
bringing a lawsuit, because it is generally more difficult for them to find jobs following termination, 
compared to nonexempt personnel (given the stigma associated wi th having been dismissed from a high-
level position). Furthermore, such employees, given the conditi on of their finances, can often hold out 
longer than rank-and-file employees can and are therefore able to resist accepting initial (and even 
subsequent) settlement offers by their former employers. The st ate of their finances allows well-
compensated former employees to continue the litigation process , which ultimately increases both 
eventual settlements and defense costs.  
Claim History 
Underwriters often surcharge (or  even reject) firms with a hist ory of employment-related litigation. 
However, prior claims are not necessarily grounds for rejection , especially if an organization has 
addressed the causes of such claims and has taken meaningful, e ffective action to prevent similar 
allegations in the future. On th e other hand, an underwriter wo uld, for example, be leery about a company 
applying for EPL coverage in wh ich one of its officers was sued  for sexual harassment and still remained 
with the organization following the settlement. 
A frequency of prior claims is a lso a particular concern of mos t underwriters, compared with a single 
large claim. This is because mu ltiple employment-related claims , incidents, and complaints often indicate 
management and/or employee morale  problems. In contrast, a sing le, isolated catastrophic claim is 
generally perceived by insurers as a “one-off” occurrence that is not likely to happen again. 
Written Procedures 
Underwriters carefully evaluate a company’s written procedures regarding employment practices.  
Written HR Procedures Are Helpful in Defending Claims  
Although written HR procedures may not necessarily prevent clai ms, they are nevertheless helpful in 
defending against claims (provided the organization has followe d those procedures). Take the case of a 
company that has written procedures requiring both yearly, deta iled performance reviews and warnings 
for poor performers. If a terminated employee brings a discrimi nation claim, but her file contains several 
negative performance write-ups a nd ample written warnings, the existence of such documents—as 
required by the company’s HR procedures—will make it easier for  the employer to defend the case. 
Critical Policy Areas to Address 
HR policies should address the fo llowing areas: salary administ ration, employee benefits, employment-at-
will statements, performance appraisal, discipline, discharge, interviewing, hiring, work assignments, 
postemployment offers of medical  coverage, providing references , grievance procedures, discrimination 
policies, and sexual harassme nt. Of course, the effective enforcement  of these policies is a factor in which 
underwriters will also be interested.  
Turnover and Termination Rates 
Underwriters carefully assess turnover and termination rates si nce unfavorable trends could indicate 
employee morale and/or managemen t problems. High turnover and t ermination rates also create a large 
potential plaintiff group that could bring claims against the i nsured in the future after coverage is bound.   
46 Nevertheless, these rates must be evaluated in light of two mit igating factors: (1) the rate of voluntary 
versus involuntary turnover and te rmination and (2) the extent to which the “seasonal” nature (if any) of 
the business affects turnover and termination rates.  
Management Stability 
One important consideration as it relates to turnover and termi nation rates is the extent to which a 
company’s senior management has changed in recent years. Manage ment stability is usually a sign of a 
well-run and typically profitable company. Conversely, rapid tu rnover of company executives often 
signals profitability problems that sometimes manifest themselv es in claims. 
Plans for Staff Reductions and Layoffs 
A firm’s immediate plans for la yoffs and staff reductions must be ascertained. If a company does plan 
layoffs within the near future, t he underwriter may exclude cla ims from such layoffs within a policy or, 
alternatively, impose a surcha rge, based on the clear increase in exposure caused by these plans.  
Corporate Culture 
Although impossible to quantify, a  company’s culture plays a cr ucial role in determining the likelihood of 
employee claims. For example, firms in which there is a high le vel of trust and communication are rarely 
sued. Despite its importance, a n underwriter’s assessment of an  organization’s culture remains a 
subjective exercise and is difficult to evaluate.  
Renewal Underwriting: Assessing Change 
When an EPL policy is up for renewal, the key factor that an un derwriter considers is the extent to which 
the insured and its operations h ave changed since the inception  of the soon-to-expire policy. Among the 
key items that an underwriter re views include whether there are /is: 
 New acquisitions 
 Spin-offs of subsidiaries 
 Higher-than-usual termina tion rate of employees 
 Turnover in the company’s HR management group 
 Changes in financial statements 
 Changes in written HR policies 
 Any imminent or planned layoffs

49 Chapter 5 
EPL Loss Prevention 
Overview 
Chapter 5 explains how to control the exposures to employment l itigation. In addition to preventing 
claims, these approaches will redu ce the size of claims made ag ainst an insured. The chapter addresses the 
following topics. 
 Effective hiring 
 Using protective legal documents 
 Reducing risks associated with terminations  
 Preventing claims from providing references 
 Preventing sexual harassment claims  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify measures that can mitigate EPL loss exposures and,  
 given case information, recognize deficiencies in an organizati on’s current employment practices 
and identify steps the organization can take to reduce its loss  exposures. 
Effective Hiring 
A significant percentage of all employee lawsuits are a direct result of hiring the wrong person for a 
particular job. Unfortunately, e ven companies with elaborate pe rsonnel policies and procedures hire the 
wrong people. However, if a company (1) tests for skills, (2) a ssesses the candidate’s 
character/personality, and (3) does a thorough interview and ba ckground check, the risk of hiring the 
wrong person will be vastly reduced. 
Test for Skills  
Companies should not underestimate the value of skills testing.  For example, an administrative assistant 
who types 60 words per minute, with mistakes, will be less effe ctive than one who types 90 words per 
minute without mistakes. However, if a company fails to test fo r typing skills, it will never be aware of a 
prospective employee’s level of a bility to perform a specific t ask.  
Avoiding Discrimination Allegati ons Associated with Skills Test ing 
A high percentage of jobs have a well-defined skill set that ca n be formally tested. To avoid allegations of 
discriminatory testing, the law only requires that skills tests  be “objective,” “reasonably related to the 
job,” and “validated.” Admittedl y, there have been lawsuits cla iming that preemployment tests were 
discriminatory because they had t he effect of excluding a parti cular class of persons from a job (known as 
disparate impact discriminati on, a concept discussed earlier). However, such cases are rarely filed, 
especially against private-sector employers and then typically against only large organizations.   
50 Weighing the Risk of a Discrimin ation Lawsuit versus Hiring the  Wrong Employee 
Ultimately, a company must weigh the substantial risk of hiring  a poorly qualified worker against the 
relatively low probability of a lawsuit alleging discriminatory  testing procedures. Indeed, the damage an 
underqualified workforce can cause a company is much greater th an the low probability of lawsuits the 
firm faces when it uses objective and validated tests that asse ss the skills and abilities required for a 
particular job. 
Test for Personality/Character 
A wide range of character assessment tools are available on the  market today, a number of which have 
been specifically oriented to hir ing. As is also the case with skills testing, there have been occasional 
lawsuits against firms that ha ve used psychological tests. Agai n, such risks must be weighed against the 
potential costs associated with h iring the wrong person for a j ob—lost productivity, reduced morale, 
missed business opportunities—in addition to the person’s salar y.  
Personality Assessments: How  High Are the Stakes? 
One indication of the high stakes associated with evaluating pr ospective management/professional 
employees is provided in Hiring Smart , by Dr. Pierre Mornell, in which he estimates that the cost of  
hiring the wrong employee is two-and-a-half times the person’s annual salary—provided the person is 
replaced within 6 months.  
In “Talk About Bad Company: The True Cost of a Bad Hire,” (Apri l 27, 2014; Small Business Trends ), 
Curt Finch states the following. 
 In a recent Career Builder survey, 42% of companies reported th at a bad hire cost them at least 
$25,000 in the past year, and 25% reported a loss of at least $ 50,000 
 For small companies, where every  employee often juggles many im portant responsibilities, the 
cost of a bad hire was as high as $190,000, according to a repo rt by the Association of Certified 
Fraud Examiners 
 CFO’s reported that supervisors waste 17% of their time managin g under-performing employees 
Do Not Use Personality Assessmen t Scores as the Sole Hiring Cri terion 
One means of reducing the risk s associated with lawsuits is to not use a candidate’s scores on personality 
assessments as the sole source  of hiring decisions. Rather, such tests should be used as only  one of 
several sources  of information in evaluating a candidate but not as the only d ecision-making factor.  
The one exception to this rule i s where the company has establi shed predictive validity for the particular 
position under consideration. For  example, assume an auto deale rship has used a certain personality 
assessment for the past decade. B ased on such use, the dealersh ip has found that every successful sales 
person received a specific minimum score on the segment of the test that measures extraversion (i.e., the 
extent to which a person enjoys interacting with others). If a candidate for a sales position failed to reach 
this minimum score, it would be  both appropriate and nondiscrim inatory to not offer this person the sales 
job.  
Interviewing and Background Checking  
Thorough preemployment interviews and background checks (includ ing criminal, credit, and driving 
histories), performed in compliance with state and federal laws , should be conducted. The information 
obtained from such procedures will be valuable in assessing a p rospective employee’s track record of 
previous problems with managemen t and history of job turnover d uring his or her career.  
51 Powerful Interview Questions 
Three powerful interview questi ons can spot problem employees b efore they are hired. Each can be an 
important “tell” in evaluating a job candidate. The questions a re as follows. 
 What was it in your last job  that felt most unfair?  
 What was it in your last job t hat excited you the most?  
 What were the three biggest cha llenges in your last job, and ho w did you overcome them?  
The first question provides insight into whether the applicant is a “self-created” victim who has problems 
accepting responsibility for his or her actions and their resul ts. The answer to the second question 
indicates what the potential employer can hopefully recreate in  the job for which the candidate is being 
considered. Finally, the last question provides insight into th e person’s problem-solving style, yet another 
key factor in evaluating prospective employees. 
Obtaining References on Prospective Employees: Secure Releases from Former 
Employers 
Employers are often reluctant to  provide detailed, subjective i nformation about former employees. 
Therefore, when checking the background of a prospective employ ee, attempt to obtain a “post-
employment release of employment information” request. When sig ned by the prospective employee, the 
release authorizes that person’s former employer to provide det ailed information about that person’s 
tenure with the organization. Even more important, this form re leases the former employer from liability 
claims associated with providing t his information. Such a form,  a standard feature found in HR software 
packages, will make it easier to obtain meaningful reference in formation from prospective job candidates. 
Ask the Rehire Question 
Many firms, when asked to provide information about former empl oyees, refuse to release any more than 
“name, rank, and serial number” (despite receiving a release fr om a former employee). However, they 
will sometimes answer the follo wing question, the response to w hich is very telling: “Was the employee 
eligible for rehire at the time he or she left your company?” A lthough a number of HR directors refuse to 
provide subjective information about an ex-employee’s tenure, t hey will occasionally provide an answer 
to this all-important but seemingly less-intrusive rehire quest ion, the answer to which provides an 
interviewer with a significant piece of information. 
Verify Academic Backgrounds 
The potential for degree fraud is becoming ever more likely, gi ven the proliferation of Internet-based 
diploma mills that not only print authentic-looking diplomas fr om reputable, nationally respected 
universities but also provide tra nscripts of supposed coursewor k completed at these institutions.  
The problem of counterfeit diplomas and transcripts is easily s olved. All colleges and universities 
routinely offer students “transcript request forms” that should  be completed by the applicant and marked 
so that the requested transcript will be sent directly to a company’s HR manager —rather than to the 
former student who is requesting the transcript. This simple st ep will eliminate virtually all possibility of 
degree fraud. Accordingly, a com pany should never accept as ver ification of an academic credential or 
degree a diploma or even a transcript—no matter how official lo oking—if a job candidate furnishes them 
directly.  
 
  
52 Online Searches of Job Candidates 
Increasingly, employers are using the Internet to gather inform ation about job applicants, using online 
social networking websites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and othe rs. There is no federal law expressly 
prohibiting online searches of j ob candidates, and only a few s tates do not allow it. There are both 
advantages and disadvantages associated with this practice, the  nature of which are summarized in 
Exhibit 5.1.  
Exhibit 5.1  
Should You “Google” Job Applicants?  
Why You Should  
 
In-Depth Information.  An employer can potentially obtai n more detailed, candid infor mation about 
the applicant’s background, experie nce, articles the person has  written, or professional reputation 
than it may learn during a  “scripted” interview. 
 
Uncovering Relevant Negative Information.  The employer may obtain personal details that could 
indicate a lack of professionalis m or maturity, such as drug us e or use of inappropriate or 
discriminatory language on a Facebook page. 
 
Why You Shouldn’t  
 
Information an Employer Would Rather Not Have . An employer could, for example, learn that an 
applicant is gay, is a member of a particular religious or poli tical group, is disabled, has children, or 
has some other protected char acteristic. If the applicant is no t hired and is then able to show that 
such information was uncovered in an Internet search, the candi date could allege that the 
impermissible criterion was the reason he or she was not hired.   
 
Possible Invasion of Privacy.  An electronic search of an applic ant may result in an invasion  of 
privacy claim.  
 
State Statutes.  Some states, such as New York , have enacted statutes prohibiti ng discrimination 
based on lawful off-duty activi ties. Therefore, if, through an Internet search, an employer learns that 
an applicant is a member of a certain religious sect and ends u p not hiring the candidate, the 
employer must be able to articulate a legitimate reason not related to his/her rel igious activities for 
rejecting the person. 
 
Reliability Issues.  A search may disclose informa tion about someone else with the same name  as 
the applicant. Moreover, informa tion about an applicant could h ave been posted by a third party and 
may be untruthful or defamatory.  
 
Possible Negligent Hiri ng/Retention Claims.  An employer regularly Googles all of its job 
applicants yet fails to discover negative information about an applicant who is hired and 
subsequently assaults a customer. Here, it could be asserted th at, despite its established practice of 
Googling applicants, the employer  failed to discover readily ob tainable information concerning the 
employee’s prior conviction for assault. 
  
53 Online Search Precautions 
When conducting online searches, s everal basic steps can limit potential liability associated with this 
process. 
 Create and Follow a Written Online Search Policy.  If a business is going to Google applicants, 
it must have a written policy stating both the logic and the me chanics behind it. If all applicants 
will be Googled, the policy shoul d so state. Or, if only certai n positions within a company require 
candidates to undergo a search, the policy should note this acc ordingly.  
 Tell Applicants They Will Be Googled and Secure Their Permissio n. If a company decides to 
conduct online candidate searches , applicants should be told th at as a condition of potential 
employment, the company will do so. Then, if a candidate agrees  to this practice, he or she can 
have no expectation of privacy.  
 Only Google “Finalists.”  Given the potential legal lia bilities and other assorted pitfa lls 
associated with online searches, it is a good idea to use them selectively. Thus, companies should 
only conduct searches of people w ho are (1) “qualified” and are  (2) being seriously considered 
for the job in question. 
 Document Rejections Based on Google Searches.  If a company rejects/does not make an offer 
to a candidate otherwise qualifie d for a job, based on informat ion gleaned from an Internet 
search, the company should documen t the specific information fo und, as well as the reason why it 
disqualified the candidate.  
Using Protective Legal Documents 
Despite the publicity garnered by large employment-related verd icts, many firms still fail to use 
protective legal documents that might have prevented or mitigat ed these large damage awards. Some of 
the more important protective legal documents include “at-will”  employment agreements, management 
rights statements, agreements in which employees assent to arbi trate (rather than litigate) employment-
related claims, and agreements barring employees from bringing class action litigation. In addition, 
outside counsel with employment law expertise should be asked t o review all employer-produced, HR-
related material. 
Have Employees Sign “At-Will” Employment Agreements 
Both new and current employees s hould be required to sign a sta tement acknowledging that their 
employment is on an “at-will” basis, meaning that they can be t erminated for cause or for no cause, at any 
time, and with no advance notice . The “at-will” doctrine is rec ognized in most jurisdictions.  
Avoid Implied Promises of “Permanent” Employment 
Businesses must avoid making statements at the time of hire or during an employee’s tenure that could be 
construed as promises of permanent employment. In addition, the  employer should make sure that 
employees clearly understand (through either signed statements or contract provisions) that no oral 
understandings or promises are incorporated into the employment  relationship. Employee handbooks 
should also be audited to ensure that they contain no statement s that could be interpreted to guarantee 
permanent employment. 
Include a “Management Rights” Pr ovision in Written Material  
Any written material given to em ployees, both new and existing,  should include language reserving the 
right of the organization to modify and interpret HR policies a nd practices without advance notice and at 
management’s sole discretion. This is known as a “management ri ghts” provision and will help to defeat  
54 claims alleging that the company promised to notify employees o f any future changes to the employee 
handbook. 
Require Employees to Sign Mandato ry Arbitration Agreements  
Employers should consider asking employees to sign binding arbi tration agreements, which preclude an 
employee from suing an employer and instead require that employ ment disputes be settled by binding 
arbitration. There have, howev er, been numerous legal challenge s brought against mandatory arbitration 
agreements, some of which have been successful. Accordingly, de pending upon both the state in which a 
business is located or headquartered, along with other particul ars, mandatory arbitration agreement may 
not be enforceable. 
Advantages of Mandatory A rbitration Agreements 
Observers agree that the advantages of arbitration to employers  outweigh the potential disadvantages. 
These advantages are noted as follows.  
 Avoids the Unpredictability of Juries. Employers and defense counsel prefer arbitration 
because it avoids the risk of a so-called runaway jury. Since t he majority of jurors identify more 
with an individual employee than with an employer, juries somet imes have a tendency to 
dispense their own brand of justice in the form of an astronomi cal award. In contrast, arbitrators 
usually have a better ability tha n most jurors do to understand  the reasoning behind legitimate 
business decisions made by an employer.  
 Has Lower Costs Than Litigation. Compared to a trial, an arbitr ation proceeding involves less 
discovery and fewer motions than a typical lawsuit, producing c onsiderable savings in legal fees.  
 Affords Earlier Resolution. The time between the filing of an employment claim and the 
arbitration hearing is usually much shorter than the time from the filing of a lawsuit to the trial 
date. The benefit of achieving an  early final resolution of emp loyment cases, where emotions 
often run high and tension in t he workplace lingers for some ti me, is extremely important to any 
company. 
 Removes the Dispute from Public Scrutiny. Employers want to keep their workplace disputes 
out of the public fishbowl known as the courtroom. Private arbi tration achieves that goal. 
Have Employees Sign Agreements Barri ng Employment-Related Class Action 
Lawsuits 
One variation of mandatory arbitr ation agreements includes agre ements prohibiting employees from 
bringing employment-related cl ass action litigation against the ir employers. Yet, as is also the case with 
mandatory arbitration agreements, agreements prohibiting class actions have been met with resistance by 
employees and again and may not  be universally enforceable. On one hand, the 2nd, 8th, and 9th US 
Circuit courts of appeal have he ld such agreements enforceable.  On the other hand, the National Labor 
Relations Board (NLRB) in Murp hy Oil USA, Inc., 361 NLRB No. 72  (2014), reaffirmed an earlier 
decision in which the NLRB found that requiring employees to wa ive their right to bring class actions 
against employers violated the National Labor Relations Act (NL RA). As a consequence, considerable 
legal expense may be incurred if  an employee brings an action d isputing such a provision. Thus, 
employers should recognize the risks of including class action waivers within mandatory arbitration 
agreements. 
Use Legal Counsel to Review Employer-Produced Material  
Both internal and external coun sel should review all employer-p roduced written material (e.g., employee 
handbooks, “at-will” state ments, arbitration agreements, benefi ts descriptions, and HR policies) for 
possible misleading statements regarding the employer-employee relationship.   
55 Preventing Wrongful Termination Claims 
A number of steps can help to minimize both the incidence and s everity of wrongful termination claims. 
These are noted in Exhibit 5.2 a nd discussed in the paragraphs that follow. 
 
Exhibit 5.2 
Preventing Wrongful Termination Claims 
 Conduct periodic performance evaluations.  
 Avoid knee-jerk terminations.  
 Consider alternatives to termination.  
 Be consistent in making termination decisions. 
 Educate and assist managers in the termination process.  
 Terminate at the right time and place.  
 Use counseling, employee assistance, and outplacement programs .  
Conduct Periodic Performance Evaluations  
Conducting periodic performance evaluations that honestly note deficiencies but give the employee 
opportunity for remedial action is  the initial step in preventi ng wrongful termination claims. Directly 
addressing performance deficiencies is critical because it is d ifficult to justify termination or demotion 
when a person has received ostens ibly adequate ratings for an e xtended period of time. Performance 
evaluations should be conducted on a regular basis (at least on ce yearly, and quarterly for employees who 
are experiencing difficulties) and follow written procedures de veloped by management.  
To the extent possible, it is advisable to evaluate employees u sing objective and quantifiable performance 
standards—for example, in the case of a customer service repres entative, on the basis of the number of 
customers with which he/she interacts per day or the number of customer complaints received. (However, 
a quantitative assessment is adm ittedly easier to accomplish fo r some positions than others.)  
Record Derogatory Information Carefully 
When performance has been unsatis factory, managers and supervis ors should be instructed on how to 
properly document personnel files so that especially embarrassi ng or disparaging remarks do not appear 
in writing, since these documents a re fully discoverable in emp loyment-related litigation. 
Record the Need for Remedial Steps 
After providing fair warning, cou pled with a plan for performan ce improvement, if progress is not 
forthcoming, a manager must cons ider termination. However, by h aving documented the need for 
remedial action, the organization is in a position to have demo nstrated its good faith. This will make it 
easier to defend against claims. Honest, timely evaluations, co upled with an opportunity for the employee 
to improve performance, will make  it easier to assert that the company opted for justifiable termination 
only as a last resort. 
Document, Document, Document 
Judges and juries expect to see documentation of poor performan ce. Make sure the employee signs any 
performance evaluations or warnings. Thorough and objective doc umentation of poor performance guards 
against claims of ulterior motiv es such as harassment or discri mination.  
56 Avoid Knee-Jerk Terminations 
While most employers, as a gene ral rule, fire “too slowly,” som etimes there are circumstances where an 
owner or a manager engages in a “ knee-jerk” termination. Not su rprisingly, many of these terminations 
end up as lawsuits. Rather than firing an employee during a hea ted argument, employers should take 5 
minutes and go for a walk to cool off.  
Moreover, knee-jerk terminations o ften violate the terms of a c ompany’s disciplinary procedure, whereby 
the employee is first entitled to  the opportunity  to remedy uns atisfactory performance, making room for 
affirmative arguments by a savvy  plaintiff’s counsel. If there is a company procedure for terminations, it 
should be followed. 
Consider Alternatives to Termination 
Alternatives to termination include restructuring the person’s job, moving that person to another 
department or location, or demoting the employee to a lower pos ition on a temporary or permanent basis. 
But, as already discussed, many employees have filed lawsuits n ot just for wrongful termination but also 
for wrongful demotion. Alternatively, consider giving the emplo yee leave without pay so that he or she 
can think over whether he or she w ants to continue working for the company.  
Be Consistent in Maki ng Termination Decisions 
If there is a company termination policy, employers must follow  it consistently and make sure that any 
action taken is consistent with t he manner in which the company  has previously treated other employees 
under similar circumstances. 
Educate and Assist Managers in the Termination Process  
A firm’s termination procedures should be established by manage ment, committed to writing, reviewed 
by legal counsel, distributed and explained to supervisors, and  implemented in the event that an employee 
must be terminated. By having su ch guidelines in place and then  adhering to them, a company reduces the 
possibility that the employee will prevail in a wrongful termin ation claim. 
Involve Additional Persons 
Have more than one person review a termination decision. This p erson can be an HR executive or other 
company manager. The reviewer should inquire into the immediate  supervisor’s true motivations and 
check any other concerns. (I.e., does the employee have a contr act that controls this decision?) In 
addition, it is highly recommended that the organization’s dire ctor of HR approve all terminations. 
Obtain an Independent Review o f the Decision to Terminate 
It may also be prudent to cons ider obtaining an independent, ou tside review by an employment attorney 
when confronted with a termination decision that appears proble matic.  
Terminate at the Right Time and Place 
Being terminated is a highly emotional experience. Studies have  found that employees who recover the 
most quickly are those who focus on pursuing new opportunities,  as opposed to those who dwell on their 
past circumstances. As a result of these studies, the consensus  is that employees should be terminated on 
Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday so that they do not have the enti re weekend to dwell on their 
misfortune. It is also suggested  that the termination decision be done in the morning, when everyone is 
less tired and has the energy necessary to deal with the decisi on. Lastly, seek “neutral grounds” for 
communicating the termination decision, one not regularly used by any of the parties involved in the 
termination. A conference room t hat is private or even an off-s ite location is therefore preferable to the 
manager’s or the employee’s office.  
57 Have the Appropriate Paperwork Ready 
In most states, an employer is required to give an employee his  or her final paycheck at the time of 
termination. This includes all accrued vacation pay, sick pay, commissions, and other benefits. Depending 
on the size of the company and the state in which it is located , an employer may also be required to give a 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Rec onciliation Act notice for conti nued medical coverage, an 
unemployment insurance benefits notice, information on transfer ring the employee’s health insurance, 
and 401(k) plan details. 
Addressing Severance Pay Issues 
If the employer is considering o ffering any form of severance p ackage, a release of all claims against the 
company should also be presented at the time of the termination  meeting. It should be explained to the 
employee that he or she is not required to sign the agreement a t that moment but that he or she has the 
opportunity to speak with an attorney of his or her choosing. H owever, a response to the release should be 
requested no later than 14 calendar days from the date of the d ocument. 
Handling the Exit Interview 
A witness should be present when an employee is notified of ter mination. This requirement will assist in 
corroborating what was said during the exit interview so that s omeone will be able to refute a claim of 
defamation if one is made. 
What to Say, How to Say It 
The reason(s) for termination should be stated sensitively but candidly. Acknowledge the emotional and 
financial loss an employee will suffer as a result of being ter minated. Managers should choose their words 
carefully, as if the exit interview were being taped, since cla ims are more likely to result when employees 
are treated in an unduly harsh manner.  
Use Counseling, Employee Assistan ce, and Outplacement Programs  
The separation of almost any relationship is accompanied by emo tional upheaval. Recognize that the 
employee, even if he or she is “at fault” for the termination, will be facing uncertainty, fear, anger, 
resentment, and a host of other e motions. Anything that the emp loyer can do to ease the transition will not 
only reduce the employer’s liability exposure but also send a m essage of true caring to the remaining 
workforce.  
Unless an employee was dishonest  or deceitful, it is often a go od idea to make an effort to help him or her 
find new employment. A willingness to expend funds for outplace ment services shows a company’s 
concern for and sincere efforts to help a terminated employee. These kinds of programs sometimes reduce 
an employee’s incentive for maki ng a claim and will assist in d efending a claim if one is made. 
Other techniques to avoid wrongful termination suits (or at lea st mitigate their effect if they do arise) 
include counseling and employee assistance programs (for employ ees with performance, personal, or 
substance abuse problems) and outplacement services.  
Preventing Claims from Providing References 
Providing references about former employees has the potential t o produce two types of claims.  
 The Defamation Exposure. First, they can result in claims by ex-employees alleging that their 
former employer provided untrue , defamatory references that pre vented the ex-employee from 
obtaining a new position. 
  
58  The “Wrongful Hiring” Exposure. Second, references sometimes result in lawsuits against 
firms that provide favorable references concerning former emplo yees when, in fact, such ex-
employees were known to have been incompetent, dishonest, or da ngerous. This is known as 
“wrongful hiring.” For example , Employer “A” gives a positive r eference to Employer “B” about 
a former employee who was fired for embezzling. Company “B” hir es the ex-employee, who 
embezzles from Company “B.” As a result, Company “B” sues Compa ny “A” for providing a 
knowingly false reference.  
Obtain Releases as a Condition of Providing References 
Given these potential problems associated with references, comp anies should obtain signed agreements 
from ex-employees that will preven t the kinds of claims discuss ed above.  
Specifically, companies should secu re a signed “post-employment  release of employment information” 
statement that absolves a form er employer from liability when t hey give reference information to 
prospective employers. Such a form will provide legal protectio n when a former employer releases 
subjective information about a former employee that goes beyond  “name, rank, and serial number.”  
Such agreements reduce the former  employer’s legal exposure for  providing unduly negative references 
(i.e., the defamation exposure) a nd lowers the chance that it c ould be alleged by another employer that the 
former employer failed to provide candid but derogatory informa tion about a potential employee (i.e., the 
wrongful hiring exposure).  
Preventing Sexual Harassment Claims 
A number of actions can help an  organization reduce the frequen cy and severity of claims alleging sexual 
harassment. These steps are noted  in Exhibit 5.3 and discussed in the paragraphs that follow. 
 
Exhibit 5.3 
Preventing Sexual Harassment Claims 
 Develop a written policy against sexual harassment.  
 Communicate the policy.  
 Train supervisors, managers, and employees on how to implement  the policy.  
 Develop a complaint procedure that protects the employee makin g the complaint.  
 Promptly, thoroughly, and confid entially investigate complaint s.  
 Carefully document investigations.  
 Take timely, effective action s following investigations.  
 Continuously review the program.  
Develop a Written Sexual Harassment Policy  
The most important measure in pr eventing sexual harassment clai ms is for an organization to prepare, 
distribute, publicize, and enforce a written policy against sex ual harassment.  
Contents of an Effective Sexual Harassment Policy 
An effective policy should include the following. 
 A definition of sexual harassme nt, along with specific examples  of sexual harassment  
 Strong wording prohibiting sexual harassment and outlining disc iplinary action 
 A confidential complaint-reporting mechanism   
59  A statement that all complaints and investigations will be held  confidential  
Communicate the Policy 
The policy must be communicated to all employees and supervisor s, preferably in direct meetings. It 
should be placed on bulletin boards, in the HR office, and in e mployee manuals or handbooks. US 
Supreme Court decisions have held  that the existence and commun ication of a corporate sexual 
harassment policy can sometimes p rovide an affirmative defense when confronted with such claims. 
Train Supervisors in I mplementing the Policy 
Training of all supervisors can substantially reduce an employe r’s legal liability for sexual harassment. 
Persons who know the laws prohib iting sexual harassment should administer training. During training, 
managers and supervisor s should be given guidance regarding the  types of conduct that constitute sexual 
harassment.  
Develop a Confidential Complaint Procedure  
Developing a confidential compla int procedure is another key el ement of a corporate sexual harassment 
policy. However, unless a complaint can be made outside  of the normal organizational chain of command, 
the complaining employee is exposed to the risk of retaliation.  For example, assume that a female 
administrative assistant alleges harassment by her male supervi sor. If, under her employer’s complaint 
procedure, she must report such  harassment to her supervisor, t here will be obvious disincentive to make 
such a complaint, given the high probability of retaliation aga inst her. Accordingly, sexual harassment 
complaint procedures should provide that employees must file gr ievances with appropriate individuals 
who work in different departmen ts (e.g., HR) within the company .  
Investigate Complaints  
Once complaints are made, they must be promptly and thoroughly investigated. At least two employees 
should investigate complaints. S uch persons should be well-rega rded members of the company, and, 
preferably, one should be of the same gender as the complaining  employee. 
Consider Using Outside Investigators 
Given the emotionally charged na ture of sexual harassment alleg ations, it is somet imes appropriate to 
retain the services of an outside firm to investigate sexual ha rassment complaints. Using such a service 
can often assist in maintaining independence and objectivity du ring the investiga tion process, which 
might otherwise be impossible if a company employee is charged with this responsibility.  
Document Investigations with Care 
It is important to recognize that internal documents pertaining  to sexual harassment investigations are 
discoverable in legal actions. For this reason, those responsib le for investigating allegations must use 
caution when or if they make subjective or derogatory remarks, either verbally or in writing. Of course, 
such cautions apply whether they  are evaluating the person maki ng the complaint or the alleged harasser. 
Take Prompt, Appropriate Actions  Following Investigations  
Following the investigation, all parties involved should be cou nseled. Appropriate discipline, including 
termination, if warranted, should follow. It is important to no te that executives and managers who are 
harassers must not be treated any  differently than nonmanageria l/nonexecutive personnel.   
60 Continuously Review the Policy  
By continuing to review the policy, modifications can be made t hat reflect the changing conditions of the 
company. Confidential exit inter views can ensure compliance wit h the policy, allow the company to 
assess its usefulness, and, ultimately, make improvements to en sure its continued effectiveness.

EPL Coverage Options 
Overview 
This chapter begins by explaini ng why EPL coverage is not provi ded under commercial general liability 
(CGL) policy forms. It then di scusses the various sources of EP L coverage.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the EPL coverage gap created by CGL forms;  
 recognize the extent of coverage available under  
o stand-alone EPLI policies,  
o management liability policies, and  
o businessowners policies (BOPs); and, 
 given relevant information, select an appropriate method of pro viding EPL coverage. 
The Lack of EPL Coverage under CGL Policy Forms 
Since the early 1990s, CGL policy forms are increasingly restri ctive as respects the extent of EPL 
coverage they provide. As the frequency and severity of EPL cla ims began to rise in the late 1980s, CGL 
insurers became reluctant to c over such claims under their poli cies. In addition, the proliferation of stand-
alone EPL forms beginning around t his time made it apparent to CGL insurers that EPL-specific policies 
were better suited to covering employment-related claims.  
The Employment-Related Practices Exclusion: CG 21 47 (12/07) 
By 1998, CGL insurers had devel oped a standardized exclusionary  endorsement that significantly 
restricted the scope of EPL cove rage available under their poli cies. Accordingly, nearly all CGL policy 
forms are currently being writte n with endorsement CG 21 47 (12 /07), known as the “Employment-
Related Practices Exclusion,” wh ich bars coverage of employment -related claims.  
As a result of this exclusion , stand-alone EPLI policies that f ill this significant coverage gap have become 
increasingly available, as has EPL coverage under management li ability package policies and BOPs.  
Stand-Alone EPLI Policies 
Buying a stand-alone EPLI policy has become a popular option be cause approximately 50 insurers, as 
well as Insurance Services Offi ce, Inc. (ISO), offer such forms . The following discussion addresses the 
pros and cons of this option. 
Pros  
The two advantages of this appro ach include (1) added coverage breadth and (2) availability of risk 
management and claim prevention advice.  
64 Added Coverage Breadth 
EPL exposures are “specialty” risk s, much like directors and of ficers (D&O), intellectual property 
infringement, media liability, and other exposures that typical ly are addressed with coverage-specific 
insurance products. Stand-alone EPLI  policy underwriters better  understand these risks and continuously 
update their policies to address evolving claim causes in favor able ways, as they vie for a greater or more 
profitable share of the EPLI market. For this reason, stand-alo ne EPLI policies tend to offer somewhat 
broader coverage tha n do management liability package policies or BOPs (discussed later in this chapter). 
However, the difference in cove rage breadth between stand-alone  forms and the scope of EPLI coverage 
available under management liab ility package policies has been narrowing substantially in recent years.  
Risk Management and Claim  Prevention Advice 
The availability of risk managem ent advice and practical loss p revention tools (often at no cost or low 
cost) are also significant advantages offered by a stand-alone EPL policy. Examples include providing a 
hotline for labor and employment lawyers, assisting in writing employee manuals, making online loss 
control assessments available, a nd giving advice on potentially  volatile situations. 
Cons  
Although stand-alone EPLI policies are a viable coverage option , there are nevertheless some cons, 
including higher premium cost and added risk management program  complexity.  
Higher Premium Cost 
The cost of a stand-alone policy is higher than the premium cha rged for EPL coverage made available 
under a management liability pack age policy or (especially) a B OP. 
Added Risk Management Program Complexity 
Stand-alone EPLI policies add complexity to the process of admi nistering an insurance program. More 
specifically, with the exclusion of EPL exposures by CGL insure rs and, thus, the need to buy separate 
EPL coverage, insureds must now maintain yet another “tower” of  insurance (i.e., a primary EPL policy 
and perhaps an excess EPL policy) for a risk that CGL forms onc e covered.  
Management Liabilit y Package Policies 
Management liability package po licies afford another alternativ e for obtaining EPL coverage. 
Basic Structure 
As the name indicates, such polic ies “bundle” EPL coverage alon g with several other lines of insurance, 
including D&O, fiduciary liability, special crime coverage (als o known as kidnap/ransom insurance), and 
cyber and privacy coverages. More specifically, management liab ility package policies consist of (1) a set 
of common policy provisions applicable to all of the coverage lines addressed b y the policy (pertaining to 
matters such as cancellation, subr ogation, and cooperation with  the insurer in the event of a claim) and (2) 
individual policy forms that apply only to one of these indi vidual coverages.  
Flexibility  
Usually, an insured must only select two of these five types of  coverage to be eligible to purchase EPL 
coverage under a management lia bility package policy. In other words, an insured seeking EPL coverage 
need only buy one other  of the following coverages in o rder to obtain EPL coverage wit hin a 
management liability policy: D&O, fiduciary, special crime, or cyber and privacy coverage.  
65 Cost Advantage 
Management liability policies afford meaningful premium discoun ts compared to what would be charged 
if an insured were to purchase th e aforementioned coverages sep arately. This is because an insurer uses 
much of the same data to underw rite EPL coverage as it does for  D&O, fiduciary, special crime, and 
cyber and privacy insurance. Although the exact discount will v ary, the premium for EPLI coverage 
purchased within a management lia bility package policy will be roughly 10–20 percent lower than if 
equivalent coverage were obtained under a stand-alone EPLI poli cy. 
Somewhat More Limited Eligibility 
At one time, management liabilit y package policies were made av ailable only to privately held firms, not-
for-profit organizations, and re latively small publicly traded companies (i.e., those with annual sales of 
under $25 million). 
Since that time, though, even in surers writing coverage for lar ge, publicly traded businesses (i.e., those 
with annual sales exceeding $1 b illion) have been increasingly offering management liability package 
policies.  
Coverage Breadth Nearly Equivalent to Stand-Alone Forms 
Management liability policies typically offer a scope of covera ge for EPL exposures that is nearly 
equivalent to what is availabl e under stand-alone forms. The ma jor difference is that stand-alone policies 
tend to provide a somewhat more e xtensive list of covered peril s under the “inappropriate workplace 
conduct” category. Another diffe rence is that stand-alone forms  frequently offer more  favorable extended 
reporting period (ERP) options, suc h as ERPs of more than 1 yea r. A final difference is that a handful of 
stand-alone forms offer defense- only coverage (in amounts rangi ng from $100,000 to $250,000) of wage 
and hour claims. 
Separate Limits (Per Coverage) versus Combined Single Limits  
Most management liability packag e policies are written with sep arate limits for each of the coverages 
selected. However, a minority of  policies, and especially those  for small firms, are written with a 
combined single limit. This appr oach is almost always less cost ly than one in which separate limits are 
provided and may be adequate for small insureds that have very low claim frequency. For such 
companies, the probability of sustaining both an EPL and either a D&O, fiduciary, special crime, or cyber 
and privacy claim in a single year is unlikely. Thus, for such organizations, a policy containing a separate 
EPL limit may not justify the additional cost.  
EPLI Coverage under BOPs 
BOP policies provide yet another source of EPL insurance. Cover age is provided by attaching the 
“Employment-Related Practices Liability Endorsement,” form BP 0 5 89 (01 10), to a BOP. This 
endorsement is part of the portf olio of coverage forms offered by ISO, an organization that develops 
standard policy forms and files information with state regulato rs on behalf of insurance companies that 
purchase its services. 
What Are BOPs? 
BOPs are “package policies” for small businesses. ISO BOPs comb ine several different coverages under a 
single form, most often general liability insurance and propert y insurance. As already explained, a key 
feature of package policies—and one that significantly impacts the pricing structure of the employment-
related practices liability endorsement—is that package policie s usually afford meaningful premium 
discounts. This is because, as is also the case with management  liability package policies, there are cost  
66 efficiencies inherent in the underwriting process when more tha n one coverage line is provided under a 
single policy. 
Eligibility 
Eligibility for a BOP policy is based on the type and size of a business. 
Specifically, there are two basic requirements that a business must meet to be eligible.  
 None of its locations can exceed  35,000 in square  footage (excl uding basements not open to the 
public).  
 Its gross annual sales must not exceed $6 million.  
The following types of businesse s, among others, are ineligible , regardless of whether they meet the 
requirements noted above. 
 Manufacturers  
 Auto repair or service stations; auto, motor home, mobile home,  and motorcycle dealers; parking 
lots or garages  
 Bars and pubs  
 Places of amusement  
 Banks and other financial institutions  
 Self-storage facilities that provide outdoor storage of motoriz ed vehicles of any type  
How EPL Is Covered under BOPs 
BOPs do not automatically cover EPL exposures. Rather, the poli cies cover EPLI exposures by means of 
an employment-related practices liability endorsement, form BP 05 89 (01 10). This endorsement is a 
seven-page coverage form, wr itten on a claims-made basis.  
No EPL Coverage Endorsement Ava ilable under ISO,  Non-BOP Polici es 
Interestingly, there is no sim ilar EPLI coverage endorsement fo und within the ISO CGL or property 
insurance endorsement portfolios. In other words, if an insured  is covered by a “standard” ISO property or 
ISO CGL policy (i.e., the busin ess is not eligible for a BOP), ISO offers no comparable endorsement that 
can be attached to either  the CGL policy or property policy to also afford  EPLI coverage. Therefore, if a 
company is ineligible for a BOP form, it must obtain EPLI cover age by means of either a stand-alone 
EPLI policy or a management lia bility package policy. (ISO does  offer a stand-alone EPLI policy of its 
own, although an analysis of the form is beyond the scope of th is course.)  
Premium Determination 
The premium for an EPL endorsement to a BOP policy is determine d by applying a state-specific rate for 
the $10,000 basic limit of covera ge provided by the endorsement . The premium for coverage is 
determined by multiplying the rate per employee (based on the t ype of business being covered) by the 
number of covered employees. Alt hough the basic limit available  under the ISO EPLI coverage 
endorsement is $10,000, a limit of up to $100,000 is available.  
The basic deductible available under the ISO EPLI coverage endo rsement is $500. However, a deductible 
of up to $25,000 is available, for  which commensurate premium c redit is granted.   
67 Coverage Aspects 
The coverage afforded by the e ndorsement contains similar provi sions found within stand-alone and 
management liability package policy EPLI forms.  
Positive Features 
In some respects, the endorsement  actually offers an even broad er scope of coverage than do standard 
EPLI forms (e.g., a more liberal counsel selection provision an d an ERP limit reinstatement, coverage 
areas that will be discussed later in this course).  
Negative Features 
Conversely, there are a  few areas in which the coverage falls b elow the breadth found within customary 
stand-alone policies, including the following: (1) constructive  discharge and breach of 
confidentiality/privacy are not covered perils; (2) a lack of c overage for certain special categories of 
employees including leased, temporary, part-time employees, and  for other persons, such as independent 
contractors, applicants, and volunteers; (3) no coverage for th ird-party liability; and (4) the absence of a 
discovery provision. (Such provi sions are discussed in Chapter 11 of this course.)  
Need for Higher Limits 
In addition to the coverage defic iencies noted, the largest pos sible limit that can be purchased under ISO’s 
BOP program is $100,000. This is insufficient to address the ki nds of EPL exposures faced by even the 
small employers for which the p rogram is designed. (At times, h owever, insurers do file state exceptions 
to these maximum limits, and regulators typically approve them. )

71 Chapter 7 
Covered Organizations, Covered Persons, and Covered Acts Provisions in Stand-Alone EPL and Management Liability Package Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 7 discusses the (1) cove red organizations, (2) covered persons, and (3) covered acts provisions 
contained in stand-alone EPLI and management liability package policy forms.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the coverage available to the corporate entity in sta nd-alone EPL policies and 
management liability package policies; 
 given relevant information, deter mine whether a particular pers on or group of people is covered 
by a stand-alone EPL policy or a management liability package p olicy; and 
 recognize the types of acts that  are covered and not covered by  a typical stand-alone EPL policy 
or a management liability package policy. 
Covered Organizations 
EPL policies provide explicit c overage for the corporate entity . This is critical because virtually all EPL 
lawsuits name both the corporate entity and specific individuals as defendants. Accordingly, if a lawsuit 
were filed naming an employee su ch as a manager or supervisor a s well as “XYZ Corporation” as 
defendants, the policy would also cover XYZ Corporation. 
Coverage of Subsidiaries 
The policies also cover subsidia ries of the named insured organ ization. Typically, a subsidiary is defined 
as a company in which the named i nsured organization holds a ma jority interest.  
Most underwriters are also amen able to providing coverage for e ntities in which the named insured holds 
a minority interest. This is done by way of an endorsement for additional premium. 
Coverage for Newly Acquired/Newly Formed Organizations 
Most, but not all, EPLI policies provide what is known as “auto matic coverage” (coverage that is 
immediately applicable) for newl y acquired and newly formed ent ities as long as (1) the covered 
organization holds a majority int erest in the new organization and (2) the size of the newly acquired or 
newly created organization is at or below a specific threshold,  typically based on its number of employees 
relative to the covered organization.  
72 Size Thresholds 
Usually, this threshold states that automatic coverage applies,  provided the new organization has less than 
10 percent to 35 percent (depending upon the individual policy)  of the number of the covered 
organization’s employees. This is appropriate, since automatic coverage is provided for no additional 
premium. 
Applicable Period of Coverage 
The period of time during which automatic coverage applies vari es from 30 to 90 days, depending on the 
individual policy form. For coverage to apply after  this period, the insurer requires (1) submission of 
information about the new entit y and (2) additional premium. 
Coverage Only Applies Post-A cquisition/Creation Acts 
It is important to note that au tomatic coverage only applies to  wrongful employment acts that take place 
after,  rather than prior to, acquisition/creation of the new entity. Coverage of preacquisition events needs 
to be addressed by the acquired entity’s own EPLI policy, usual ly by means of an ERP endorsement (a 
topic that will be discussed later in this course).  
Covered Persons 
Under nearly all of the policies, officers, directors, partners , managers, and employees are “covered 
persons.” In addition, the forms  typically cover (1) personal r epresentatives of insureds such as heirs, 
administrators, and executors and (2) spouses but only for thei r “status” as spouses. Thus, if an insured’s 
spouse is also named in a lawsu it but did not commit any actual  wrongful act, coverage would 
nevertheless apply to this indi vidual. Specifically, coverage w ould apply only to the spouse’s interest in 
assets held jointly (to which cla imants’ attorneys frequently s eek access). In contrast, the employee’s 
spouse would not have coverage i f, for example, the spouse was accused of committing sexual 
harassment at the insured company’s Christmas party. 
Definition of “Employee” 
While all of the policies cover “employees,” there is some vari ation between the exact definitions of the 
term “employee.” The following categories of “employee” are usu ally covered. 
 Full-time employees (including management/supervisory employees  and former employees)  
 Part-time employees  
 Leased employees  
 Temporary employees  
 Seasonal employees  
 Interns  
 Volunteers  
 Students 
 Independent Contractors 
Firms employing personnel not falling within any of these categories should review their poli cies’ 
definitions of “employee” and request modifications to secure c overage for such persons.  
73 Coverage for Former Employees 
Most but not all of the leading forms provide coverage for “for mer employees.” The rationale for this 
extension is that, by virtue of being granted coverage, it ensu res that the former employee will cooperate 
with the insurer and thereby assi st in defending a claim in whi ch the former employee is named as a 
defendant.  
Coverage of Leased Employees 
For coverage to apply to leased w orkers, all three of the follo wing requirements need to be met: (1) The 
insured must agree to provide legal indemnification to the leas ed worker as if the worker were an actual 
employee of the insured corporation. (Absent an agreement to in demnify leased workers, the insured 
company would not be legally ob ligated to indemnify the leased worker for his or her conduct. This is 
because, legally, such workers are the employees of the leasing  firm.) (2) The firm that leases the worker 
to the insured must be scheduled as an insured under the policy . (3) The insured must pay an additional 
premium to cover the leased workers. Typically, the per-leased- worker premium is one-third of the usual 
per-employee premium.  
Coverage of Independent Contractors (ICs) 
About half of all EPLI policy fo rms provide coverage for ICs. T here are three qualifications that must be 
met for coverage to apply under the insurers’ policies that cov er ICs. First, the insured company must 
agree, in writing, to indemnify the IC for employment-related l iability claims incurred while working for 
the insured company. Second, the insured’s policy must be endor sed to provide IC coverage. Third, 
additional premium is required. 
Cover Small ICs under Your Policy 
In an ideal world, ICs with which  a business engages should be required to purchase and provide evidence 
of their own EPLI coverage. Howev er, when dealing with small IC s, it may not be realistic or even 
possible to actually enforce such a requirement. Thus, when eng aging small ICs, it is best if your business 
simply purchases coverage under its  own EPLI policy, using the process noted in the preceding 
paragraph. Most often, insurer s do not object to covering ICs, provided they (a) are made aware of the 
exposure and (b) receive a n appropriate premium.  
On the other hand, when dealing with a large IC—especially one of comparable size or larger, a business 
is in a better position to mandate  that the IC provide evidence  of or purchase EPLI coverage. 
Covered Acts 
Most standard EPL policy forms c over five major categories of e mployment-related perils: (1) 
discrimination, (2) wrongful termination, (3) harassment, (4) r etaliation, and (5) a number of other 
specifically enumerated workplace torts, collectively referred to as “inappropriate employment conduct” 
or “miscellaneous workplace torts.” 
Discrimination 
Typically, the forms indicate that coverage “... applies to any  violation of any applicable (i.e., federal, 
state, or local) discrimination law....” Thus, virtually all EP L forms cover discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, national origin, r eligion, age, disability, and g enetic conditions. This is because all of these 
types of discrimination are barred by federal statutes. On the other hand, given such language, while EPL 
policies will, for example, cove r claims alleging employment-re lated discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation in New York, California, and Illinois (because such  discrimination violates state law in these 
states), comparable coverage (neither defense nor indemnity) wo uld not apply for sexual orientation  
74 discrimination in Mississippi, Alabama, or Georgia, where discr imination on this basis does not violate 
state statutes. 
Wrongful Termination 
Most but not all of the policies define the term “wrongful term ination.” However, it is actually to the 
insured’s advantage when an EPLI  policy does not define “wrongf ul termination.” This is because a 
definition of the term only serves to restrict—rather than expa nd—the scope of cove rage available.  
Those forms that do define “wrongful termination” normally defi ne it as “... actual or constructive 
termination of the employment re lationship in a manner that is wrongful and against the law or which 
breaches an implied agreement to continue employment.”  
No Coverage for Breach of an Express Employment Contract  
One key point to note is that nearly all of the policies, eithe r in their definitions of “wrongful termination” 
or in the exclusions section of  the policies, preclude coverage  for both indemnity a nd defense coverage 
resulting from wrongful termination alleging breach of an expre ss employment contract (i.e., an 
employment contract for a state d number of years, containing cl early delineated compensation amounts 
but barring termination, except for gross misconduct). As will be explained later, in the exclusions portion 
of this course, the rationale for  excluding coverage for employ ment contracts is that they are within the 
insured organization’s control (i.e., such contracts are drafte d by and agreed to by the insured 
organization) and are therefore c onsidered by insurers to be a business risk for which coverage is not 
intended. However, a handful of insurers have begun to offer co verage, via endorsement and for 
additional premium, to defend claims alleging breach of an expr ess employment contract.  
Coverage for Breach of “Implied”  Employment Contract Breaches 
Most policies do, however, offer both defense and indemnity cov erage in situations where an employee 
plaintiff alleges that a termination breached an “implied” cont ract of employment. More specifically, 
plaintiffs often assert that wording in (1) an offer letter, (2 ) an employee handbook, or (3) an oral 
statement made, for example, by a manager to a subordinate (e.g ., “You have a great future with this 
company”) created an “implied” contract of employment. 
Harassment 
When insurers first began writing EPLI policies in the early 19 90s, virtually all policy forms covered 
“sexual harassment” rather than “harassment,” as is now the cas e under most but not all insurers’ policy 
wording. This change occurred b ecause it became apparent that w orkplace harassment is usually, but not 
always, of a sexual nature. For e xample, an employee could be h arassed by means of name-calling and 
taunting, although not in a sexual manner, or could even be giv en the “silent treatment” when supervisors 
ignore them.  
Accordingly, an EPLI policy form should define “harassment” so it covers both sexual harassment and 
nonsexual harassment. 
Definition of Harassment  
The policies usually define harassment as involving unwelcome sexual  or nonsexual  advances, verbal or 
physical conduct, or requests for sexual or nonsexual favors th at 
 are either explicitly or implicitly made a condition of employm ent; 
 are used to make decisions that affect a person’s employment; 
 create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environme nt; or  
75  interfere with job performance. 
Retaliation 
The typical scenario involving a retaliation claim is one in wh ich an employee first alleges discrimination 
based on a protected status (e.g., race, gender, disability). T he second portion of the claim will then assert 
that, in retaliation for  making such a claim, the employee was treated adversely. An ex ample: after 
alleging race discrimination, an employee is demoted in retalia tion for making the race discrimination 
claim. 
In addition, retaliation is fre quently alleged (1) in conjuncti on with a claim of sexual harassment or 
wrongful termination, (2) in response to an employee’s making a  claim under a state workers 
compensation law, or (3) for whistleblowing. 
Whistleblower Retaliation Claims 
Retaliation claims can also be brought by people who are not in  a protected category, based on an 
assertion that the person was penalized or treated adversely fo r (1) complaining about or opposing certain 
employer actions (e.g., billing practices on a government contr act), (2) refusing to engage in illegal or 
unethical conduct, or (3) exposing such conduct via testimony a t a trial or administrative hearing. 
Accordingly, an EPL policy defi nition of “retaliation” should a lso include coverage for “whistleblower 
claims.” 
“Inappropriate Employment Conduct” or “Miscellaneous Workplace Torts” 
As already noted, nearly every insurer’s policy form provides c overage for claims alle ging discrimination, 
harassment, wrongful termination , and retaliation. In addition to these categories of claims, most EPLI 
policies also contain a section titled “inappropriate employmen t conduct” or “workplace torts” that 
enumerates a variety of othe r employment-related perils not falling within any of the preceding four 
categories. Importantly, the act ual scope of coverage provided by the policies varies most significantly in 
this area. Clearly, the broader t he scope of perils falling wit hin a policy’s definition of “inappropriate 
employment conduct”/”workplace torts,” the more favorable the p olicy is for the insured.  
Exhibit 7.1 lists a number of the more common acts falling with in the definitions of “inappropriate 
workplace conduct”/“workplace torts.” This list is not all-incl usive. Given the creativity of plaintiffs’ 
attorneys, new wrongful employmen t causes of action are continu ously emerging.

79 Answers to Chapter 7 Review Questions 
1.  
A. That’s correct! Nearly all EPL policies provide coverage for th e corporate entity as well as 
officers, directors, partners,  managers, and employees. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Wrongful termination is a covered per il, specifically defined in most 
policies. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Grump Corporation has coverage. 
D. This answer is incorrect. As an employee of Grump Corporation, Donald has coverage. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! Most underwriters  are also amenable to providin g coverage for entities in which 
the named insured holds a minor ity interest; this is done by wa y of an endorsement for additional 
premium. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The additional exposure should be add ressed now. 
C. This answer is incorrect. It should be possible for the existin g policy to cover the added exposure. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The au tomatic coverage would not appl y in this case because Max does 
not own a majority interest in Mini. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The period of time during which autom atic coverage applies varies from 
30 to 90 days, depending on the policy form. 
B. This answer is incorrect. When automatic coverage applies, acts  prior to the acquisition date are 
not covered. 
C. This answer is incorrect. When automatic coverage is provided, an additional premium is required. 
D. That’s correct! Automatic coverage applies only when the size o f the newly acquired organization 
is at or below a specific thresh old, typically based on the num ber of employees. Usually, 
automatic coverage applies when the new organization has less t han 10 to 35 percent of the 
number of the covered organization’s employees. Sword’s employe e count is roughly 75 percent 
of Spears’s. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. A ll policies cover employees. 
B. That’s correct! Independent contractors are not included within  standard EPL insurance definitions 
of “employee,” although coverage might be available by endorsem ent. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Spouses  of insureds are covered—not f or wrongful acts but only for their 
status as spouses who may have an interest in assets held joint ly. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Corporate officers are covered person s. 
5.  
A. That’s correct! Any definition of “wrongful termination” restri cts rather than expands the scope of 
coverage available. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. Questions can be raised whether a giv en termination was illegal. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. This definition does not cover breach  of an implied agreement to

Third-Party Liability, Wage and Hour Coverage, and Definitions of “Damages” and “Claims” Provisions in EPL Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 8 discusses the third-party liability, wage and hour an d coverage, and definitions of “damages” 
and “claims” provisions in EPL policies. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 distinguish third-party liability coverage from other coverage available in a stand-alone EPL 
policy;  
 recognize the breadth and limitations of third-party liability coverage in a stand-alone EPL 
policy; and 
 identify the losses and expenses that qualify as damages and cl aims under EPLI policy forms. 
Third-Party Liability Coverage 
The original purpose of EPLI policies was to provide coverage f or claims made by employees. More 
specifically, such policies were designed to cover claims in wh ich employees alleged that employers or 
fellow employees committed wrongful acts against them in conjun ction with their employment. However, 
in recent years, nonemployees (most often customers, clients, a nd vendors) have also made claims 
alleging harassment and discrimination committed by employers a nd their employees in a number of 
incidents. These claims have been  termed “third-party liability  claims.” 
Third-Party Liability Clai ms: High-Profile Examples 
High-profile examples of third-party liability claims were thos e made by African Am erican customers of 
two national chains: Denny’s (rest aurants) and Adam’s Mark (hot els). Both actions alleged discrimination 
against customers belonging to this minority group and produced  multimillion dollar settlements. More 
recently, in April of 2016, two bl ack women filed claims agains t Victoria’s Secret, seeking $4 million 
(each) in damages. The women alleged that they were ordered to leave the company’s Beverly Center, 
California, store, and were “… shocked and humiliated to be acc used of wrongdoing and … thrown out of 
the store as if they were criminals.”  
The Need for Third-Party Liability Coverage 
Coverage for third-party liability claims is required because C GL policies exclude coverage for 
harassment and discrimination—the two causes of action most lik ely to be alleged in claims brought by 
third parties.   
81 Public Contact: The Key Driver of  Third-Party Liability Claims 
A firm’s exposure to third-party liability claims is largely a function of the extent to which its operations 
involve contact with the public . For example, an airline, which  engages in considerable custom er contact, 
would have a much greater exposur e to third-party claims, compa red to a firm that manufactures aircraft 
engines for sale to a handful of large industrial customers.  
How Third-Party Liability Coverage Is Provided within EPL Forms 
At one time, third-party EPL coverage was available only by a s eparate endorsement. Currently, however, 
under the vast majority of forms , third-party EPL coverage is a utomatically included within the policies 
as a covered “wrongful employmen t act” and is provided as a sep arate insuring agreement (with a 
separate limit), most often designated as “Insuring Agreement B . Third-Party Liability.”  
Wage and Hour Coverage 
At one time, virtually every EPL insurer routinely excluded cov erage for wage and hour claims. Such 
claims typically allege (1) failu re to pay overtime and (2) var ious “pay practices” claims (such as failure 
to grant meal and rest breaks). Importantly, based on the polic ies’ definitions of “loss,” standard wording 
of the exclusion not only precludes coverage for settlements an d judgments, but, in addition, it eliminates 
coverage for the defense costs  associated with wag e and hour claims. 
Wage and Hour Defense Coverage 
However, around 2008, a handful of insurers began providing def ense-only coverage for wage and hour 
claims. Following are the key features of such coverage.  
 Availability of the Endorsement. The endorsement is offered as an  “automatic” part of an EPLI 
policy, rather than as an add-on. In other words, insurers that  provide the wage and hour 
endorsement include it in all of the policies they issue, rat her than add it based on the in sured’s 
request. Conversely, as respects those insurers that are not of fering the endorsement, when 
approached about adding it, they all routinely decline to provi de wage and hour coverage at any 
price. 
 $100,000 or $150,000 Sublimit. Depending on the particular ins urer, in the current market, the  
endorsement affords defense cove rage of wage and hour claims wi th a sublimit of $100,000 or 
$150,000. 
 No Additional Limit of Insurance Created. Significantly, the aforementioned available 
sublimits apply within, not in a ddition to, the policy’s regula r aggregate limit. For example, 
assume that the full $250,000 s ublimit is paid out under a wage  and hour coverage endorsement 
to an EPLI policy in conjunction with the defense of a claim. A lso assume that the policy 
contained a $1 million per claim/aggregate limit. In this situa tion, $750,000 ($1 million less 
$250,000) would remain to cover other types of claims under the  policy. 
Wage and Hour Indemnity Coverage 
Beginning in January 2013, Aon created a program to cover both the defense and indemnity costs of wage 
and hour claims. However, the pr ogram requires a minimum $1 mil lion per claim retention. And since 
only a small percentage of employers can realistically assume l osses of this magnitude, the program 
covered just a handful of large companies. Since the Aon progra m was introduced, one insurer, Beazley, 
began offering a wage and hour  indemnity policy with a $250,000  minimum per claim retention (although 
with lower available limits than other insurers writing this li ne of coverage), a figure that is likely to 
attract a larger field of potential insureds. In short, the mar ket for wage and hour indemnity coverage is in 
a fluid state and is likely to evolve considerably over the nex t 5 to 10 years.   
82 “Covered Damages” Definition 
EPLI policy forms contain “covered damages”/”covered loss” prov isions that specify what the policies do 
and do not cover. 
The most expansive policies incl ude the following within these definitions.  
 Compensatory damages (i.e., settlements and judgments) 
 Defense costs 
 Punitive damages 
 Liquidated damages under ADEA, FMLA, or the Equal Pay Act 
 Back pay 
 Front pay 
 Claimant’s attorneys’ fees 
 Pre- and post-judgment interest 
Excluded Losses/Excluded Damages 
On the other hand, nearly all po licies’ definitions of “covered  damages/covered loss” do not include the 
following items. 
 Fines, Penalties, Sanctions. Virtually all of the forms’ definitions of “loss” or “damages” 
preclude coverage for fines, pen alties, and sanctions. To provi de coverage for such items, which 
accrue as a result of wrongful c onduct, would violate public po licy. 
 Taxes.  The policies almost universally  exclude coverage for taxes, be cause taxes are obligations 
that accrue from state, local, and federal tax laws—not as a co nsequence of legal liability for 
certain employment practices. 
 Damages Associated with Employmen t Contracts/Severance Payments . Coverage for 
damages involving contracts of employment, such as obligations to make severance payments in 
the event an employee is termina ted with or without cause, are not within EPLI policies’ 
definitions of “loss” or “damag es.” This is because the draftin g of such contracts and agreements 
is within the control of the insured organization at the time t hese contracts were developed and is 
thus considered a business risk.  
 Nonpecuniary Relief.  Coverage for relief not associated with monetary damages (e.g. , 
reinstating a wrongfully terminated employee) is not within the  policies’ definitions of “loss” or 
“damages.” This is because insurance contracts provide promises  to pay money under certain 
circumstances rather than providing performance guarantees. 
 Loss of Use or Destruction of Property.  EPLI policies exclude coverage involving liability for 
damage to and/or loss of use of  business or personal property, because this exposure is covered 
under CGL policy forms. 
 Medical Expenses for Physical Injury.  Liability for medical  expenses incurred as a 
consequence of bodily injury i s excluded by EPLI policies becau se this exposure is addressed 
under workers compensation policies. 
 Insurance Plan Benefits.  Some, although not all, of the forms, either by their definiti ons of 
“loss” or “damages” or within t he exclusions sections, preclude  coverage for benefits owed to 
employees as part of judgments or settlements. The rationale un derlying this approach is that 
obligations to provide employee benefits are business risks and  therefore do not fall within the  
83 scope of coverage intended by t he policies. Another rationale f or excluding these items within the 
policies’ definitions of loss is that the policy does not inten d to cover items that could be 
addressed by a fiduciary/employee benefits liability policy.  
Still another reason for excluding insurance plan benefits is t hat their actual cost on a long-term, 
“going-forward” basis is highly speculative. For example, if a claimant is awarded 10 years of 
benefits (that she would have r eceived had she not been wrongfu lly terminated), it would be very 
difficult to predict the actual cost of such benefits that many  years into the future. Case in point: 
during some years, the cost of health insurance coverage rises by 3 to 5 percent, whereas in 
others, it has increased by as much as 20 percent.  
 Costs Relating to Labor Disputes.  Such costs are precluded either by the policies’ “loss” or 
“damages” definitions or by sep arate exclusions because these c osts are business risks to which 
firms in particular industries, especially those subject to col lective bargaining agreements, are 
exposed. 
Punitive Damages 
Nearly all insurers’ forms gran t coverage for punitive damages,  provided punitive damages are insurable 
in the jurisdiction within which  a claim for such damages has b een brought. Since EPL claim judgments 
frequently include punitive damag es, the value of such coverage  is considerable.  
The Unpredictability of Punitive Damages Awards 
In addition to their sheer ma gnitude, another reason punitive d amages coverage is important is that, by 
their very nature, punitive dam ages awards are highly unpredict able. For example, in Kolstad v. American 
Dental Ass’n , 527 U.S. 526, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d. 494 (1999), a c ase involving sexual 
harassment, the $50,000 compensato ry award represented less tha n 1 percent of the $7 million in punitive 
damages that were awarded. In another instance, a lawsuit again st the Ralph’s supermarket chain in 
California produced an award of $5 million each to 6 women who alleged sexual harassment, for a total 
of $30 million, in addition to an earlier judgment of $550,000 for emotional damages. Surprisingly, there 
were no compensatory damages awarded. 
Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions 
Since the early 2000s, EPL insur ers have attempted to circumven t state-specific prohibitions against 
insurer payment of punitive dama ges (i.e., about 40 percent of the states bar such coverage) by means of 
what are known as “most favorable  jurisdiction” provisions. Suc h wording states that, with respect to 
determining the insurability of  punitive damages, the law of th e jurisdiction most favorable to the 
insurability of punitive damages will apply, provided one of th e following four criteria is met: (1) the act 
giving rise to the punitive dam ages award occurred in a jurisdi ction allowing punitive damages coverage; 
(2) the claim giving rise to the  punitive damages is made in su ch a jurisdiction; (3) the insured is 
incorporated or maintains its p rincipal place of business in a jurisdiction allowing punitive damages 
coverage; or (4) the insurer is incorporated or maintains its p rincipal place of business in such a 
jurisdiction. Accordingly, most favorable venue wording is impe rative (1) when purchasing an EPL 
policy in a state where punitive damages are not insurable and (2) for insured companies having 
multistate operations and that the refore cannot predict where t he claims seeking punitive damages will 
arise. 
Two Limitations of Most Favorabl e Jurisdiction Provisions 
Most favorable jurisdiction provisions contain two key limitati ons. First, they merely modify the existing 
level of coverage for punitive d amages already provided by an E PL policy; they do not provide coverage 
if the policy excludes punitive damages (although the vast majo rity of EPL forms do not). Second, the 
enforceability of most favorable j urisdiction wording has never  been tested in court. As a result, insureds  
84 should request such wording but not be required to pay addition al premium for it, because an insurer’s 
liability for payment, as a result of this endorsement, remains  uncertain. 
Definition of “Claim” 
The manner in which the policies define the term “claim” has an  important bearing upon the scope of 
coverage the forms provide. In addition to the fact that standa rd wording in an EPLI policy covers both 
oral and written  demands for damages in conjunctio n with claims, the policies a lso cover legal expenses 
incurred that involve (1) adminis trative hearings and (2) crimi nal indictments associated with 
employment claims. 
Coverage for Written and Oral Demands 
Coverage is triggered under the policies not only by a written demand (i.e., a summ ons and complaint) 
but also by an oral demand. Occasionally, an employee-claimant’ s attorney will make claims orally (e.g., 
when he or she calls the insured company, notifying it of the i ntention to sue). I n other instances, 
employees make oral claims themselves. For instance, after bein g terminated at the end of an exit 
interview, many an employee has said something to the effect of  “I’m going to sue this place for 
everything it’s worth.” Oral notif ication of a claim accelerate s the trigger of coverage; because it 
eliminates the need to wait for a written lawsuit before report ing the claim to an insurer, this approach is 
advantageous for an insured. 
Coverage for Administrative Hearings 
A policy’s definition of “claim” should also include coverage f or administrative proceedings before the 
EEOC, as well as proceedings and hearings before applicable sta te and federal agencies.  
Such a definition is essential for an insured because, frequent ly, a claim is triggere d due to hearings and 
proceedings even before  litigation has been filed against the corporate organization. In these situations, 
insured organizations immediatel y begin to incur legal costs, e ven prior to being served with a lawsuit, 
given the necessity of retaini ng legal representation at such i nvestigatory proceedings.  
The Cracker Barrel Case: Why the Defini tion of “Claim” Must Include EEOC 
Hearings 
The case of Cracker Barrel v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. , No. 11–6306, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 19161 (6th Cir. 
Sept. 10, 2012), heard by the Sixth Circuit of the US Court of Appeals, illustrates the importance of an 
EPLI policy definition of “claim” that encompasses EEOC hearing s. In this situation, 10 employees filed 
race and sexual discrimination ch arges with the EEOC against Cr acker Barrel. The EEOC, in turn, sued 
Cracker Barrel on behalf of the employees. After Cracker Barrel  reported the claim to Cincinnati 
Insurance Company, the insurer d enied coverage because the poli cy stated that, for a matter to qualify as 
a “claim,” it had to be brought “by the employee.” Cincinnati a sserted that, rather than being brought by 
the employees, it was filed by the EEOC and thus did not qualif y as a “claim.” Unfortunately for Cracker 
Barrel, the court agreed with Cin cinnati’s argument and upheld the insurer’s coverage denial. Given this 
situation, it is imperative th at an EPLI policy’s definition of  “claim” includes within this term “claims 
brought by the EEOC.” 
Coverage for Criminal Proceedings 
Also important is the fact that nearly all of the policies’ def initions of “claim” encompass coverage for 
criminal proceedings associated  with employment litigation. Suc h coverage is advantageous for insureds 
because civil employment litigation also frequently has a criminal com ponent. Case in point: The CEO of  
a corporation is sued civilly for sexual harassment. In additio n, he is charged with assault in connection 
with the sexual harassment and w ill require defense coverage fo r the criminal indictment.

87 Chapter 9 
Claims Management, Defense Cost, and Special Conditions in EPL Policies 
Overview 
Given the nature of employment -related litigation, the claims m anagement and defense cost provisions 
are among the most important sections in the policy. In additio n, EPL policies are written with a number 
of conditions that are particular  to such policies. Chapter 9 e xamines these provisions in detail. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the types of conditions typically found in an EPL poli cy that relate to claims management 
and defense costs, 
 recognize the effect of various EPL policy conditions relating to claims management and defense 
costs,  
 recognize the effect of special conditions that reduce deductib le amounts or deal with other 
insurance, and 
 identify the types of loss cont rol services that some insurers offer to their EPLI insureds. 
Claims Management Provisions 
The manner in which a policy addresses the claims management pr ocess has a significant bearing on the 
actual scope of coverage provide d by an EPLI policy. The key cl aim handling areas include (1) claims 
settlement procedures, (2) duty to  defend versus non-duty to de fend language, and (3) defense cost 
provisions. 
Claims Settlement Procedures 
Only a small percentage of EPLI forms contain the traditional “ hammer clause” provision. A hammer 
clause becomes operative when the  insured and insurer cannot ag ree on a settlement figure proposed by 
the insurer. Under such circumsta nces, if the insured prefers t o defend a claim rather than settle it, the 
insured must pay any additional amount for which the claim is e ventually settled plus defense costs 
incurred from that point forward.  
Coinsurance Hammer Clauses—A Favorable Variation 
A favorable variation of the hammer clause—and one that is used  by the majority of EPL insurers—is the 
so-called coinsurance hammer clau se. Such provisions provide fo r (1) a sharing of defense costs incurred 
after the insured refuses to con sent to settlement and (2) a sh aring of any settlement amount or judgment 
amount that is larger than the settlement amount that the insur er wanted the insured to accept. The most 
common sharing percentage is 70 percent insurer/30 percent insu red. Coinsurance hammer clauses benefit 
insureds because they continue the coverage on a partial basis if the insured decides to litigate rather than 
settle a claim based on an insurer’s recommendation.  
88 How “Traditional” Hammer Clauses Operate: An Example 
An insurer recommends that an insured agree to settle an EPL cl aim for $200,000. The insured withholds 
consent and instead opts to litig ate the claim. A judgment of $ 500,000 is eventually awarded against the 
insured, and, in the process, the  insured incurs an additional $125,000 in defense costs. Under a 
“traditional” hammer clause, the  insured must self-insure the d ifference between the $500,000 judgment 
and the insurer’s original $200 ,000 settlement recommendation ( $300,000). The insured must also absorb 
the $125,000 in defense costs th at were incurred following the insured’s refusal to settle for the amount 
recommended by the insurer. In effect, the insured will be out of pocket an additional $425,000 ($300,000 
settlement amount above that reco mmended by the insurer, plus t he $125,000 in defense costs incurred 
following the insured’s refusal  to settle based on the insurer’ s recommendation).  
How Coinsurance Hammer Clauses Operate: An Example 
Assume the identical scenario noted above. Again , the insurer r ecommended that the insured settle the 
claim for $200,000, but the insured withheld consent. A verdict  is eventually rendered for $500,000, and 
$125,000 in additional defense costs are incurred following the  insured’s refusal to settle for the amount 
recommended by the insurer. Under a policy with a 70 percent co insurance hammer clause, the insurer 
would pay 70 percent of the add itional settlement amount (i.e.,  70 percent of $300,000 or $210,000) plus 
70 percent of the additional $125,000 in defense costs ($87,500 ), for a total of $297,500. As a result, the 
insured’s share would be the s ubstantially lower amount of $127 ,500, compared to its  $425,000 share that 
it was required to pay a policy with a standard hammer clause ( in the previous example). 
Duty to Defend Language versus Non-Duty to Defend Language 
When EPLI policies emerged in the  early 1990s, most of the form s were written on a “duty to defend” 
basis. Today, however, the EPLI m arket has evolved to the point  where the policyholder also has the 
option to purchase what is known as a non-duty to defend form. This is especially true if an insured has 
purchased a stand-alone EPLI policy.  
 The phrase “duty to defend”  in an EPLI policy expressly states that the insurer has the du ty to 
defend any claim alleging a covered act under the policy.  
 The phrase “non-duty to defend”  in an EPLI policy states that the insurer does not have the du ty 
to defend claims, rather that it is the duty of the insured to defend claims. Such forms only 
compel the insurer to pay the defense costs in connection with the insured’s executing the defense 
of the claims.  
Three of the important differe nces between a “non-duty to defen d” and “duty to defend” policy are (1) the 
right to choose defense counsel, (2) the right to control the d efense of the claim, and (3) the insurer’s 
obligation to defend when one o r more allegations associated wi th a given claim are  not covered by the 
policy.  
Defense Counsel Selection Issues  
In most circumstances, under a “duty to defend” policy, unless specifically negotiated otherwise in the 
policy, the insurer has the right to choose defense counsel. (T he attorney is selected from the insurer’s list 
of law firms, known as “panel counsel.”). Conversely, under a “ non-duty to defend” policy, the 
policyholder is able to use any lawyer of its choosing.  
Claim Handling Issues  
Another key difference between a  “non-duty to defend” EPLI poli cy and a “duty to defend” EPLI form is 
in the area of claim handling a nd control of the defense proces s. Specifically, “non-duty to defend” 
programs allow the policyholder—not the insurer—to create the “ reputation” that the policyholder seeks 
to project because they permit th e policyholder to handle and s ettle claims. In contr ast, under a “duty to  
89 defend” policy, the insurer typically has the absolute right to  control the defense of the claim—by means 
of invoking the policy’s “consent to settlement” or “hammer” cl ause (discussed earlier), if the insured 
wants the coverage afforded by the policy.  
In contrast to the benefits of being able to make autonomous cl aim settlement decisions afforded by a 
non-duty to defend policy, a duty to defend provision may benef it an insured if the insured is 
inexperienced in managing the co mplexities of employment litiga tion. Under such circumstances, an 
insured is generally better off if it delegates strategic claim s management decisions to an insurer rather 
than trying to make them internally. For this reason, the EPL s ections of management liability package 
policies are usually written with duty to defend provisions. Th is is because smaller, privately held 
companies (as opposed to large public companies) are generally covered by “packages.”  
However, for firms that are more  familiar with the details of t he EPL claim handling process (typically 
larger companies that are more routinely faced with such claims ), an EPLI policy containing a non-duty 
to defend provision may be preferable.  
“All Allegations” Defense Coverage  
Another difference between duty to defend and non-duty to defen d policies is that under the former, the 
insurer is obligated to defend all of the allegations in a laws uit, as long as at least one such allegation is 
covered by the policy. The fo llowing scenario illustrates the i mportance of this point. A former employee 
with 20 years of service is terminated by an insured. In additi on to her claim for wrongful termination, she 
also alleges damages from the f act that the company failed to p ay her overtime during her last 5 years of 
service (i.e., a wage and hour claim).  
Although damages arising from the wrongful termination allegati on are covered by a standard EPL policy 
form, the wage and hour claim is excluded. However, since cover age exists for the first allegation (i.e., 
wrongful termination), an insurer, under a duty to defend polic y, must also defend the wage and hour 
claim; although it would not be liable for any potential damage s. In contrast, under a non-duty to defend 
policy, the insurer would only be obligated to pay the costs of  defending the wrongful termination claim. 
Related Claims Provisions 
Related claims provisions in EPLI policies, also sometimes refe rred to as “interrelated claims provisions,” 
apply to situations (1) in which more than one claim  results from a single  wrongful act and (2) when 
claims from a single  wrongful act are made during more than one  policy period.  
According to such provisions, the insured is entitled to the li mit applicable when the first claim was made, 
rather than the sum of the limits  that were applicable to the p olicy periods during which all claims were 
made.  
In addition, related claims provisions also state that a single  deductible applies to each claim. 
Related Claims Provisions: An Example 
The following scenario offers a p ractical example of how a rela ted claims provision functions. An insured 
company purchased EPL policies with the following terms and lim its.  
 January 1, 2017, to Janua ry 1, 2018, $1 million;  
 January 1, 2018, to January  1, 2019, $2 million; and  
 January 1, 2019, to Janua ry 1, 2020, $3 million.  
During 2016, a male supervisor sexually harassed three differen t female employees at the company. Each 
of these individuals made claims against both the supervisor an d the company on July 1, 2017, July 1, 
2018, and July 1, 2019, respectively. All three claims resulted  from a single related wrongful act (i.e., the 
same supervisor’s harassment), y et the claims in this instance were made during three different policy  
90 periods. Under these circumstances, only one policy limit (i.e. , the $1 million limit applicable during the 
January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2018, policy period) would apply  to all three claims, because that was the 
year in which the first claim arising from the original wrongfu l act was made.  
Since, as noted above, related cla ims provisions indicate that a single deductible applies to each claim, in 
this example, only one deductible /retention would apply to all three individual claims, since the claims 
arose from essentially the same set of circumstances.  
Defense Cost Provisions 
In addition to covering claim se ttlements and judgments, EPLI p olicies pay the costs required to settle or 
defend claims. Such items typically  involve (1) attorneys’ and adjusters’ fees and expenses; (2) the cost of 
legal proceedings, including med iation and arbitration; and (3)  the cost of appeal bonds. (Insurers are not, 
however, obligated to furnish such bonds.) Under some, but not all, insurers’ forms, defense costs also 
include monies that the insured must pay while assisting the in surer during the defense and investigation 
of claims (subject to a per-day limit of $250 to $500, dependin g on the insurer), such as attending trials or 
depositions.  
Expenditure of Defense Costs Reduces Policy Limits 
Almost without exception, the expenditure of defense costs redu ces the limits available to pay claims 
under EPL policies. This is in contrast to the approach used in  CGL policies, in which defense costs are 
paid in addition to policy limits. Given the high costs of defe nding EPL claims, insureds should bear this 
“shrinking limits” factor in mind when deciding on how much cov erage to purchase. Often, defense costs 
can far exceed the actual settlement figure or judgment rendere d against an insured in employment-related 
claims.  
Additional Defense Coverage Limits  
Given the fact that the expend iture of defense costs reduces po licy limits, a handful of insurers include 
provisions within their forms that afford additional  coverage limits for defense costs. When an insured 
purchases additional limits under these provisions, it is impor tant to note that (1) such limits are in 
addition to  the regular limits provided by the policy, (2) those limits ca n only be applied to defense costs, 
and (3) the additional defe nse coverage limits apply before  the regular policy limits are used.  
Insurer Internal Claims Handling Expe nses Are Not Considered Defense Costs 
Importantly—and although they are  covered by EPLI policies—inte rnal insurer claim handling staff 
costs, such as in-house attorney s and independent adjusters, ar e not considered defense costs. This 
approach benefits insureds becau se it means that such monies do  not deplete the coverage limit available 
under the policy, since, as was explained above, payment of def ense expenditures is within—not in 
addition to—an EPLI policy’s limits. 
“Value Added” Loss Control Services 
Depending on the insurance company, EPLI policies often contain  a provision for loss control services. 
Such services are provided at no cost or significantly reduced cost to the EPLI policyholders. Their 
purpose is to reduce the insured’s exposure to employment-relat ed claims being made against them. 
When selecting among competing insurers, the nature, availabili ty, and quality of value -added provisions 
and services should be carefully considered.  
Just as the different insurers’ forms vary with respect to the scope of coverage, a correspondingly wide 
range of possible “value-added” services is available. These se rvices may include the following. 
 An HR law compliance audit conduc ted by an attorney or HR profe ssional  
91  An online self-audit that takes the insured through a series of  detailed questions and, based on the 
answers to the questions, provi des an assessment of the areas i n which the organization could be 
vulnerable to claims 
 Personnel forms, software for creating employee handbooks, and other policies and procedures 
that the insured can adapt for its own use 
 “Hotline” services manned by employm ent law attorneys or HR spe cialists, which assist in 
managing “on-the-spot” complianc e issues, problems, and dispute s  
 Training materials in print or online format 
 Continuing education workshops aimed at presenting approaches t hat reduce and control claims

94 Answers to Chapter 9 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The term circuit breaker does not app ly when the insured “re-fuses” to 
settle. 
B. This answer is incorrect. This term refers to an Armand hammer product. 
C. This answer is incorrect. It’s n ot a deal breaker, but it does change the picture. 
D. That’s correct! A “hammer claus e” becomes operative when the in sured and insurer cannot agree 
on a settlement figure proposed b y the insurer. If the insured prefers to defend a claim rather than 
settle it, the insured must pay any additional amount for which  the claim is eventually settled. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The insured must also absorb the addi tional settlement costs. 
B. This answer is incorrect. No coinsurance is involved in this ex ample. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The in sured must also absorb addition al defense costs. 
D. That’s correct! The insured must absorb the $200,000 additional  settlement amount plus the 
additional $75,000 in defense costs. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The in sured must absorb only a portio n of the additional defense costs. 
B. That’s correct! The insured must absorb 30 percent of the addit ional defense and settlement costs. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The in surer must pay an additional $1 92,500. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The insurer pays a portion of the add itional settlement and defense costs. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The po licy covers more than the haras sment claim. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The harassment claim is covered. 
C. That’s correct! Under a duty to defend policy, the insurer is o bligated to defend all allegations in a 
lawsuit, as long as the policy c overs at least one such allegat ion. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The in surer will provide the defense.  
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Covera ge is available under one or mo re of these policies. 
B. That’s correct! Because of the po licy’s related claims provisio n, only the $1 million policy limit 
would apply to all three claims , because that was the year in w hich the first claim arising from the 
original wrongful  act was made. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The highest of these three limits doe s not apply in this case. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The related claims provision does not  permit the insured to stack the 
limits that apply to claims ma de from a single wrongful act, ev en if the claims are made in 
different years.  
95 Chapter 10 
Exclusions in EPL Policy Forms 
Overview 
EPL forms differ significantly with respect to the actual wordi ng of the exclusions they contain, and these 
differences have a substantial impact on the actual scope of co verage a given policy provides. Often, a 
policy will exclude a particular e xposure, but the policy’s exc lusionary wording will also be written with 
“exception” wording that has the effect of “adding back” and th us covering certain aspects of the 
otherwise excluded exposure. Chapter 10 analyzes wording of the  most common EPL policy exclusions.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the important characteristics of EPLI exclusions that pertain to 
o criminal, fraudulent, or intentional acts; 
o bodily injury; 
o WARN Act liability; 
o liability under workers compensation and similar laws; 
o contractual liability; 
o liability under the ADA; 
o wage and hour claims; 
o claims about which an insu red had prior knowledge; 
o claims reported to prior insurers; 
o claims for nonpecuniary relief; 
o labor-related claims; 
o claims for breach of employment contracts; and 
o claims for insurance benefits and 
 recognize problematic wording in  EPLI exclusions and identify m ore acceptable alternatives. 
Criminal, Fraudulent, or Intentional Acts 
Virtually all of the policies preclude coverage for fraudulent,  criminal, and intentional acts.  
Final Adjudication Wording 
However, nearly all insurers’ forms promise to defend  allegations of such acts until “final adjudication,” 
whereby it is judicially determi ned that an insured caused or i s indeed responsible for intentionally 
causing an injury.  
96 Non-imputation Wording 
The intent of such wording is to cover the insured organization  (and in some instances, other individual 
insureds), despite the fact that the insured organization may b e vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of 
another culpable individual.  
For example, if a supervisor com mits sexual harassment, the ins ured organization, which is vicariously 
liable for the supervisor’s act s, will have coverage despite th is exclusion (although the supervisor will 
not).  
Accordingly, this exclusion indicates that wrongful acts of a c riminal, malicious, or intentional nature 
committed by one insured will not be imputed to any other insured . This has the effect of preser ving 
coverage for insureds who were not culpable in causing a claim,  while barring coverage as to those who 
acted intentionally. So in this ex ample, the supe rvisor’s wrong ful act will not be imputed to his employer 
(the insured organization), a nd, as a result, the insurer will defend the employer and pay any judgment or 
settlement on the employer’s behalf if it is found to be vicari ously liable for the employee’s wrongful act. 
Bodily Injury 
Liability for claims involving bodily injury is excluded by EPL  policies because such coverage is 
typically afforded under CGL policy forms. 
Key Exception Language 
However, most, but not all, versions of this exclusion “except, ” and therefore cover, damages for (1) 
emotional distress, (2) loss of reputation, (3) mental anguish,  or (4) humiliation. This type of coverage is 
important because employment-related claims frequently allege d amages associated with such perils, 
which, if caused by employment-re lated acts, would not be cover ed under CGL policies. 
WARN Act Liability 
Under the federal WARN Act, emp loyers of 100 or more persons ar e required to give their workers 
specific notice periods prior to various types of mass layoffs or plant closings. The majority of EPL 
policies preclude coverage for cla ims alleging failure to provi de such notice as required by this law, with 
the rationale that a failure of this type is within the control  of the insured.  
Key Exception Language  
However, a favorable variation of this exclusion is one in whic h there is an exception, and therefore 
coverage, for claims alleging WA RN Act violations if the insure d organization consulted with attorneys 
prior to the claim being made a nd the insured attempted, in goo d faith, to comply with the law. 
Liability under Workers Comp ensation and Similar Laws 
Nearly all of the forms exclude c overage for the insured’s obli gations under workers compensation and 
similar laws, such as disability, unemployment compensation, th e Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA), the Occupational Sa fety and Health Act, the Racket eer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations (RICO) Act, and others. 
One rationale for this exclusion is that separate coverage is a vailable for obligations associated with some 
of these laws, such as workers compensation and ERISA. In addit ion, insurers will not, on a public policy 
basis, provide coverage for lia bilities associated with laws su ch as RICO (which involve clearly culpable 
conduct).  
97 Key Exception Language for Retaliation  
Favorable versions of this exclusion do, however, contain impor tant exception language. Specifically, 
such language affords coverage for retaliation that takes place  as a result of an employee exercising his or 
her rights under any of these laws.  
Contractual Liability 
The vast majority of EPLI forms  exclude coverage for contractua lly assumed liability (i.e., an agreement 
to indemnify or hold a th ird party harmless).  
Exception for Liability in the Absence of a Contract 
Nearly all policies contain an exception that provides coverage  for liability that would have attached in 
the absence of a contract. For example, assume an insured organ ization periodically leases employees 
from an employment agency. The i nsured organization agrees to i ndemnify the employment agency for 
any wrongful, employment-related acts committed by the insured organization against the employment 
agency’s employees. Yet, under these circumstances, the insured  organization would have been liable,  
even in the absence of the contract , to indemnify the employment agency. Consequently, the contrac tual 
liability exclusion will not appl y, and coverage will be availa ble under the insured organization’s EPLI 
policy.  
ADA 
Loss arising from an insured’s failure to comply with any accom modations or building modifications for 
the disabled, as required by the ADA, is excluded by most EPLI forms. The effect of this exclusion is to 
preclude coverage, for e xample, for the costs an insured incurs  to install wheelchair access ramps within 
its building. Insurers consider this exposure a business risk a nd therefore exclude it. 
Coverage Is Not Excluded for Discrimination Based upon Disability 
However, it should be recognized t hat this exclusion would not apply if, for example, a disabled person 
were to allege discrimination b ecause he or she was denied empl oyment (because of his/her disability) 
with an insured company. In e ffect, the purpose of the ADA excl usion is to preclude c overage for the cost 
of making physical modifications, rather than to eliminate cove rage if it is alleged that an insured 
discriminated on the basis of a plaintiff’s disability.  
Exception Wording Covers Defense Costs in Response to Injunctive Relief 
Some versions of this exclusion contain exception wording that affirmatively provides coverage for the 
costs of defending  claims alleging violation of t he ADA, which is, of course, fav orable for the insured.  
Wage and Hour Claims 
Virtually all EPLI policies excl ude coverage for “wage and hour  claims.” As explained earlier in this 
course, such claims fall within o ne of two broad categories: (1 ) misclassification claims, which are claims 
alleging that an employer misclassified an employer as an “exem pt” employee (i.e., one who is exempt 
from receiving overtime) and then failed to pay overtime to the  employee and (2) pay practices claims, 
which comprise “all other” types of compensation-related claims  (e.g., not allowing employees to take 
rest and meal breaks, miscalculating the amount of wages owed, failing to pay employees on a timely 
basis).  
Exception for Coverage of Claims under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
Most EPLI policies contain wording that modifies the exclusion so it does not apply to claims associated 
with the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963. This law, which prohibi ts discrimination in determining the  
98 wages of male and female employees, mandates equal pay for both  sexes when work involves equal 
levels of skill, effort, and responsibility.  
Exception for Retaliation Claims 
Another advantageous (for the insured) version of this exclusio n excepts and thus cove rs claims alleging 
retaliation that are caused by an employee’s filing a wage and hour claim (e.g., after filing a wage and 
hour claim, an employee received a negative performance review and, in response, brought a retaliation 
claim against the company). 
Prior Knowledge of Potential Claims 
Nearly all EPLI policies exclude  coverage for claims produced b y circumstances or incidents that the 
insured knew, prior to policy inception, had the potential to r esult in claims. The purpose of EPLI policies 
is to cover only fortuitous cir cumstances about which the insur ed had no knowledge prior to the inception 
of the policy, as opposed to incidents for which claim potentia l was recognized, despite the fact that a 
formal claim had not yet been mad e at the time of policy applic ation.  
Only Knowledge by Managers or E xecutives Should Be Considered “Prior 
Knowledge” 
Nearly all versions of this exclusion state that only knowledge  of a potential claim by a manager, 
supervisor, director, or officer can bar coverage.  
Claims Reported to Prior Insurers 
Most policies exclude coverage f or claims reported under prior insurers’ policies. The rationale for this 
exclusion is that a subsequent policy may contain broader cover age and/or higher/additional limits. 
Accordingly, if a claim reported  to a prior insurer was exclude d and/or had its limits exhausted by 
payment of the claim, an insured might attempt to make the same  claim under a subsequent policy. 
Nonpecuniary Relief 
Most EPLI policies exclude covera ge for nonmonetary damages. Co verage of such damages, also known 
as “injunctive relief” or “nonpec uniary relief” (e.g., reinstat ement of a terminated employee), is beyond 
the intended scope of EPLI forms because insurance policies are  contracts to pay money rather than to 
perform or enforce the performance of services. 
Exception for Defense Costs 
Favorable versions of this exclusion “except,” and therefore co ver, the costs required to defend claims 
seeking nonpecuniary relief, which can be considerable.  
Labor-Related Claims 
Most of the leading EPLI forms e xclude coverage for claims made  by employees who are striking, locked 
out, or temporarily or permanently replaced. The rationale for this exclusion is that it addresses what is 
essentially a business risk faced by the employer and, for that  reason, is considered uninsurable. 
Breach of Employment Contracts 
Nearly all EPL forms exclude coverage for damages accruing when  the insured organization breaches an 
explicit employment contract. Such damages are typically in the  form of severance payments called for 
under the contract.  
99 The rationale for the exclusion is that the insured was in cont rol of this exposure when it entered into the 
employment contract, as well as when it terminated the contract . The exposure is therefore viewed as an 
uninsurable business risk.  
Defense Coverage for Breach of Employment Contracts 
Although no insurers’ forms cove r the indemnity costs associate d with the breach of employment 
contracts, most insurers’ polici es affirmatively cover defense costs associated with claims alleging breach 
of an employment contract. 
Defense Coverage for Loss for Which the In sured Would Be Liable in the Absence 
of a Contract  
In addition, EPLI forms generally  cover loss for which the insu red would be liable in the absence of a 
written contract. Such loss is typically in the form of defense  costs. The following example illustrates 
how such coverage applies.  
After he is terminated, there is a dispute as to the amount of wages that a former employee had earned and 
was therefore owed by the insure d organization. In this situati on, even in the absence of an employment 
contract, the insured organiza tion would still be liable for ea rned wages prior to termination. Although the 
policy would not cover a settlement that encompassed actual wag es earned (because EPLI policies’ 
definitions of “loss” or “damages” exclude earned wages), it wo uld pay the cost of defending against the 
claim.  
Insurance Benefits 
Nearly all EPLI forms contain excl usions precluding coverage fo r the payment of both compensation and 
insurance benefits to an employ ee once he or she is no longer w orking at the insured company. The 
rationale underlying this approach is that obligations to provi de both future compensa tion and benefits are 
business risks and therefore do no t fall within the scope of co verage intended by EPL policies.  
Exception for Coverage of Benefits as a Part of Claim Settlements 
Frequently, however, as part of a wrongful termination lawsuit,  a former employee claims a loss of both 
compensation and insurance benefits, resulting from his or her termination. If a settlement of the claim 
were to provide for a certain lump sum of money that, presumabl y, was intended to replace some or all of 
the lost compensation/benefits, this exclusion would not preclu de coverage for a judgment or a lump sum 
settlement in conjunction with the claim.  
No Coverage for Earned Wages 
On the other hand, this exclusion does preclude coverage for wages that a claimant had earned prior to  
termination. Again, this is a business risk that the policies d o not intend to cover.   
100 Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1. Otto Mann, a supervisor at Leat her Company, has been accused of  harassing a junior employee 
who worked in his department. Before receiving notice of a clai m, the company claims it was 
unaware of the alleged harassme nt. Leather’s EPL policy contain s the usual exclusion for 
criminal, fraudulent, or intentional acts. How, if at all, will  the harassment claim be covered? 
A. The insurer will defend both Otto  Mann and Leather and pay any judgment against 
Leather. 
B. The insurer will defend Leather and pay any judgment against Le ather. Otto Mann is not 
entitled to any protection. 
C. The insurer will defend Otto Mann and pay any judgment against him. 
D. The insurer will not defend eith er Otto Mann or Leather because  harassment is illegal. 
2. Most EPLI policies exclude coverage for damages for 
A. bodily injury. 
B. emotional distress. 
C. humiliation. 
D. loss of reputation. 
3. Before proceeding with a tentativ e plan to lay off 25 of its 14 0 employees, Critical Mass 
Company consulted an attorney for guidance in complying with an y laws that might apply to a 
mass layoff of this type, and the  company then followed the att orney’s advice. Nevertheless, a 
group of terminated employees filed a claim alleging that the C ritical Mass layoff violated the 
federal WARN Act. How would most  EPL policies respond to this c laim? 
A. The claim would be covered through an exception to the WARN Act  exclusion. 
B. The claim would be covered through an exception to the workers compensation 
exclusion. 
C. The WARN Act claim would be excluded. 
D. The workers compensation exclusion would preclude coverage for this claim. 
4. Goldie, a Locks Company employee , told a coworker that continui ng sexual harassment by 
another coworker was making her job unbearable, but she had not  filed a complaint because she 
needed the job. Locks’ EPLI policy excludes coverage for incide nts or circumstances that have 
the potential to produce claims i f an insured had knowledge of it prior to policy inception. This 
exclusion 
A. can lead to a denied harassment claim since an employee knew of  Goldie’s alleged 
harassment. 
B. ensures that any claim Goldie makes will be covered. 
C. ensures that management personne l will report such incidents in  the new or renewal 
application so the underwriter can determine how best to handle  it. 
D. would preclude coverage if Goldie ’s manager or supervisor was a ware of the harassment. 
5. Ivanna Verk’s wrongful termination claim against Jerk Enterpris es was partially successful; and 
the court ordered Jerk to give Ivanna her job back but did not award any back pay to Ivanna. 
How, if it all, will Jerk’s EPLI respond to the related EPL cla im?  
101 A. Ivanna is entitled to compensator y damages, which the insurer w ill pay. 
B. The insurer will pay the costs of reinstating Ivanna’s position . 
C. The labor-related claims exc lusion will preclude coverage. 
D. The nonpecuniary relief excl usion will preclude coverage.  
102 Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1.  
A. That’s correct! Due to the policy’s final adjudication wording,  the insurer will defend allegations 
against Otto until his liability is judicially determined. Than ks to the policy’s non-imputation 
wording, the insurer will defend  Leather and pay any judgment a gainst Leather even if another 
insured (Otto) was liable for wrongful acts. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Otto  is entitled to a defense against  these allegations. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The insurer will not pay a judgment f or Otto’s intentional acts. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The in surer will defend both Otto and  Leather until it is judicially 
determined that an insured caused or was responsible for the in tentional injury. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! Liability for cla ims involving bodily injury is  excluded by EPL policies because 
such coverage is typically afforded under CGL policy forms. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Most policies cover emotional distres s through an exception to the bodily 
injury exclusion. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Most policies cover humiliation throu gh an exception to the bodily injury 
exclusion. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Most policies cover humiliation throu gh an exception to the bodily injury 
exclusion. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Most policies do not include this exc eption. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Workers compensation does not apply t o a layoff. 
C. That’s correct! The majority of EPL policies preclude coverage for claims alleging to provide 
notice of a layoff as required by the WARN law with the rationa le that a failure of this type is 
within the control of the insured. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Workers compensation does not provide  layoff benefits. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Nearly  all versions of the prior know ledge exclusion state that only 
knowledge of a potential claim by a manager, supervisor, direct or, or officer can bar coverage. 
B. This answer is incorrect. It exc ludes coverage, in effect, for some claims. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The exclusion does nothing to ensure that incidents are reported. 
D. That’s correct! Nearly all EPLI policies exclude coverage for c laims produced by circumstances or 
incidents that the insured knew, prior to policy inception, had  the potential to result in claims. 
However, nearly all versions of th is exclusion state that only knowledge of a pot ential claim by a 
manager, supervisor, director, or officer can bar coverage. 
  
 
  
 
  
103 5.  
A. This answer is incorr ect. The settlement did  not require Jerk t o pay back pay to compensate Ivanna 
for a period of unemployment, so no pecuniary damages are invol ved. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Damage s for injunctive relief are not  covered. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The la bor-related claims exclusion do es not apply. 
D. That’s correct! Most EPLI policies exclude coverage for nonmone tary damages. Coverage of such 
damages, also known as “injunctive relief” or “nonpecuniary rel ief” (e.g., reinstatement of a 
terminated employee), is beyond the intended scope of EPLI form s because insurance policies are 
contracts to pay money rather tha n to perform or enforce the pe rformance of services.  
104 Chapter 11 
Coverage Triggers in EPL Policies 
Overview 
Chapter 11 examines the coverage trigger provisions found withi n EPL policies, all of which are written 
on a claims-made basis.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the distinctive features of claims-made coverage trigg ers and 
 recognize how claims-made covera ge triggers function in an EPL policy. 
Operation of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
EPLI policies are written on what  is known as a “claims-made” b asis, which requires that two conditions 
be met for coverage to apply.  
 First, the claim must be “first made” against the insured durin g the policy term. This means that, 
for coverage to apply,  the claim must not have previously been made against the insured during a 
policy with an earlier term of coverage.  
 Second, coverage applies only if the act giving rise to a claim  takes place on or after the policy’s 
“retroactive date.”  
Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates in EPLI policies state that, for coverage to apply, the wrongful act giving rise to a claim 
must have taken place on or after  the retroactive date specified by the policy’s declarations pa ge.  
Purposes of Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates have two purposes. 
 First, retroactive dates exclude coverage for possible wrongful  acts committed in conjunction 
with some known event (i.e., known to the insured) that took pl ace prior to policy inception.  
 Second, they also eliminate cove rage for wrongful acts that too k place far in the past—even if 
unknown to the insured. 
Retroactive Dates in Policies for First-Time EPL Buyers 
Retroactive dates are sometimes included in EPLI policies for f irms that are buying coverage for the first 
time. This is because underwriters a re reluctant to offer “full  prior acts coverage” (i.e., policies without 
retroactive dates) under such c ircumstances. Their concern is t hat the insured’s sudden desire to obtain a 
policy may have been prompted by the need to obtain coverage fo r circumstances they suspect could 
produce a claim in the future.   
105 However, even if additional premiu m is required, the first-time  buyer of EPL coverage should purchase a 
policy that does not contain a retroactive date if coverage on this basis is available. Otherwise, no 
coverage will be available for any claim that is made against t he insured during the policy period if the 
insurer can demonstrate that the  claim was caused by that acts took place prior to the inception of the 
policy. This could have the eff ect of excluding coverage for a significant portion of the insured’s 
exposure to employment-related claims. 
Retroactive Dates in Policies fo r Companies Currently Insured 
On the other hand, for a company that already has an EPLI polic y in place with another insurer, inclusion 
of a retroactive date that is the same as the new policy’s ince ption date should be strongly resisted unless 
there is a specific underwriting reason, such as a recent, tota l overhaul of a company’s operations. In other 
words, attempts should be made to have a policy written without  a retroactive date (or one coinciding 
with the first EPLI policy purchased by the insured). 
An Example 
A company’s current policy has a term of 1/1/16–17 and a retroa ctive date of 1/1/06, the date on which 
the company began doing business. In this situation, if the com pany decides to purchase coverage from a 
new insurer, the new insurer  should not (except under unusual c ircumstances) offer the company a policy 
with a retroactive date earlier than 1/1/06.  
Discovery Provisions 
Circumstances often arise under which it is probable that an ac t will eventually cause a claim to be made 
against a company, despite the fact that litigation may not be initiated for some time. To address this 
problem, virtually all EPL policies are written with what are c alled discovery provisions (also known as 
awareness provisions or notice of claim provisions ). These allow the insure d to advise the insurer—
during the policy period—of situa tions that could later produce  a claim against the insured. In the event 
such situations do result in a c laim, the claim will be conside red to have been “made” during the policy 
period in which the insured origi nally notified the insurer. At  that point, despite the fact that the actual 
claim is made against the insured long after the policy period has terminated, coverage applies 
nonetheless. 
An Example 
An insured has an EPL policy written with a 1/1/18–19 term of c overage. On 3/1/18, a female employee 
at the company complains to the HR department that her supervis or has been harassing her for the past 
month. Given the possibility that this situation could eventual ly result in an actual lawsuit against the 
company, later that day, its risk manager, under the EPL policy ’s discovery provision, reports this 
“incident” to the insurer. On 3/1/19, a year after receiving no tification of the “incident” and reporting it to 
the insurer, the company receives a lawsuit from the employee. 
In view of the fact that the risk manager reported the “inciden t” to the insurer, cove rage will apply under 
the 1/1/18–19 policy despite the fact  that the policy is no longer in  force. Once an incident is rep orted 
during the term of a claims-mad e policy, coverage is “locked in ,” regardless of how far in the future a 
formal claim is made.  
ERPs 
If an insured cancels or non-renews an EPL policy, unless a rep lacement policy is purchased, there will be 
a gap in coverage for claims ma de after cancellation or nonrene wal. To prevent such a gap, an insured can 
purchase an “extended reporting pe riod endorsement” (ERP). An E RP covers wrongful acts committed 
during the expired or canceled policy if they later result in c laims against the insured.  
106 An Example 
An insured has an EPL policy wr itten for a term of 1/1/20–21. W hen the policy expires, the insured does 
not renew it. As a result, the i nsured will have no coverage fo r any claim made against it after 1/1/21 (the 
date on which the policy expires) unless it either (a) renews t he 1/1/20–21 policy or (b) buys an ERP. 
No Coverage for Claims Caused by Wrongful Acts During the ERP 
The ERP does not, however, cover claims caused by wrongful acts  that took place during  the ERP itself. 
Rather it only covers claims (1 ) made against the insured and (2) reported to the insurer during the ERP—
provided the wrongful act that gave rise to the claim took plac e prior to the inception of the ERP. 
Availability 
Nearly all EPL policy forms permit the insured to purchase an E RP even if cancellation/nonrenewal is at 
the insured’s election. This is known as a two-way ERP tail.  
Automatic ERPs 
The majority of insurers’ forms offer what is termed an “automa tic ERP,” which allows the insured to 
report claims for either a 30- or 60-day period (depending upon  the insurer) following policy 
expiration/cancellation. There is no additional premium charge for an automatic ERP. 
No Reinstatement of Limits 
When an insured purchases an ERP, no additional limits are crea ted or reinstated . Thus, any claims 
reported during the ERP are subject to the original policy limi t, even if other claims have been made 
under the policy. 
An Example 
Following expiration of an insured’s $1 million EPL policy, wit h a January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, 
term, the insured buys a 1-year ERP with a term of January 1, 2 021, to January 1, 2022. Assume that, 
during the now-expired January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, pol icy term, the insured reported two claims. 
Any monies paid in conjunction with the two claims will reduce the limit available under the ERP. Thus, 
if $500,000 is paid out for indemnity and defense of these two claims, the insured will have a limit of 
$500,000 available for any other claims reported during the ERP . 
Duration 
About half of all EPL policies offer ERP choices of several dif ferent durations. Such policies usually give 
the insured the option of up to four different time periods, no rmally ranging from 1 to 5 years. The 
remaining insurers’ forms offer only a single-duration option, with 1 year being the most common option. 
Premium Charge 
The policies specify the premium  charge for the ERP option as a  fixed percentage of the expiring policy’s 
premium, most often 100 percent for a 1-year ERP. 
Time in Which to Elect 
The majority of EPL policies allow the insured 30 days followin g nonrenewal, expiration, or cancellation 
to purchase the ERP. The remainder of the leading insurers allo w the insured to make this decision within 
60 days after that date.   
107 Coverage for “Notice of Circumstances” during ERP 
A key variation between the ERPs in EPL policy forms is whether  a report of an “incident” or “notice of 
circumstances” that has the pot ential to but has not yet result ed in a formal claim against the insured will 
be covered by an ERP. In effect, under some insurers’ ERP wordi ng, the policy’s discovery provision is 
operative, whereas, in others, it is not. 
Given these circumstances, it is apparent that an ERP provision  that covers “incidents” is far superior to 
that which requires the report of an actual “claim” to trigger coverage.  
108 Chapter 11 Review Questions 
1. To trigger coverage under a clai ms-made policy, the claim must be made 
A. after the retroactive date for an act occurring during the poli cy period. 
B. before the retroactive date for an act occurring during the pol icy period. 
C. during the policy period for an act that occurred on or after t he retroactive date. 
D. during the policy period for an act that occurred before the re troactive date. 
2. Ace Company’s current EPL policy has a term of 1/1/17–18 and a retroactive date of 1/1/10, the 
date on which the company began doing business. Ace’s only EPL claim involved a wrongful act 
during 2015. If Ace decides to purchase coverage from a new ins urer, the new insurer should not 
normally offer the company a polic y with a retroactive date ear lier than 
A. 1/1/2010. 
B. 1/1/2015. 
C. 1/1/2016. 
D. 1/1/2017. 
3. Deuce Corporation management jus t learned that one division of the company has been 
systematically violating wage and hour laws; this raises the po ssibility that workers in that 
division might make a wage-and- hour claim against Deuce. To dat e, however, no claim has been 
made. Deuce has an EPL policy with a discovery provision that a llows Deuce to advise its current 
EPL insurer of the situation that could later produce a claim. According to the discovery 
provision, what will happen if Deu ce gives notice to the insure r? 
A. If the situation results in a claim, the claim will be consider ed to have been made during 
the policy period in which the i nsurer was originally notified.  
B. The insurer will add an exclusion for this situation when the p olicy renews, thereby 
eliminating coverage f or claims related to t his incident that a re made during future policy 
periods. 
C. The insurer will not renew Deuce’s EPL policy. 
D. The insurer will substantially i ncrease the premium when Deuce’ s EPL policy renews. 
4. Claims would be covered under an EPL policy with an ERP for an alleged wrongful act that was 
committed 
A. after the policy’s termination date but during the ERP. 
B. after the retroactive date and b efore the policy’s termination date. 
C. after the retroactive date and during the ERP. 
D. before the retroactive date. 
  
 
  
109 5. As regards the decision whether to purchase coverage for an opt ional ERP, a typical EPL policy 
A. permits the insured to activate ER P coverage during a 1-year pe riod following the 
policy’s termination. 
B. stipulates the premium that will be charged and requires the in sured to declare during the 
policy period its intention to purchase or forgo ERP coverage. 
C. stipulates the premium that will be charged and the time period  following nonrenewal, 
expiration, or cancellation during which the ERP may be elected . 
D. stipulates that the insured mus t select ERP coverage at policy inception.  
110 Answers to Chapter 11 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The act need not occur during the pol icy period. 
B. This answer is incorrect. It is not possible to make a claim fo r something that hasn’t happened yet. 
C. That’s correct! For claims-made coverage to apply, (1) the clai m must be first made during the 
policy term, and (2) the act givin g rise to the claim must take  place on or after the policy’s 
retroactive date. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The act must have occurred on or afte r the retroactive date. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! If there is a retroactive date, it should coinc ide with the inception date of the 
insured’s first EPLI policy. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The in sured would then have no covera ge for claims arising out of 
wrongful acts prior to 1/1/2015. 
C. This answer is incorrect. This  retroactive date would preclude coverage for any additional claims 
resulting from the 2015 incident, but the insured would be bett er served by an earlier retro date. 
D. This answer is incorrect. For a company that alr eady has an EPL I policy in place with another 
insurer, inclusion of a retroactive date that is the same as th e new policy’s inception date should be 
strongly resisted unless there is  a specific underwriting reaso n, such as a recent, total overhaul of a 
company’s operations. 
3.  
A. That’s correct! Even if an actua l claim is made against the ins ured long after the policy period has 
terminated, coverage ap plies nonetheless. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The policy’s discovery provisions wou ld make such an exclusion 
irrelevant. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The discovery provision does not spec ify that the policy will not be 
renewed. 
D. This answer is incorrect. An underwriter might take Deuce’s los s experience into account when 
renewing the policy, but that is not a function of the discover y provision. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. There is no coverage for wrongful act s during the ERP. 
B. That’s correct! Coverage applie s to wrongful acts that took pla ce on or after the policy’s 
retroactive date and before th e policy’s termination date. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Only p art of this statement is correc t. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Wrongful acts occurring before the re tro date are never covered. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. A 30- t o 60-day time period is typica l. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The stipulation ma y be made after the  policy terminates. 
C. That’s correct! Nearly all polic ies indicate the specific ERP o ption’s premium charge as a fixed 
percentage of the expiring polic y’s premium and allow the insur ed 30 (sometimes 60) days to elect 
coverage. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. The stipulation ma y be made on or aft er policy termination.  
111 Glossary 
ADA —See Americans with Disabilities Act. 
ADEA —See Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 
adverse action —One of the elements of a retaliation claim. Examples include d enial of a promotion, 
refusal to hire, demotion, suspension, discharge, threats, repr imands, negative evaluations, harassment, 
and change in hours. 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 —A law that prohibits the making of 
employment decisions (e.g., hiring, promotion) based on age. It  applies to employees or applicants who 
are 40 years or older and to companies with 20 or more employee s. The ADEA specifies various remedies 
if a firm is found to have violated the law. Some of these incl ude hiring an applicant who was 
discriminated against, reinstating a terminated employee, and p aying of back wages, liquidated damages, 
“front” pay until an employee r eaches the age of 70, court cost s, and attorneys’ fees. 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 —A federal statute passed in 1990, primarily aimed at 
preventing discrimination in hiring persons having a “disabilit y” as defined by the Act. Under the ADA, 
employers must afford job appli cants equal opportunity (i.e., e valuating an applicant solely on his/her 
ability to perform the essential functions of a job, regardless  of disability) and make reasonable 
accommodations to allow disabled employees to perform job funct ions. However, employers are relieved 
from the reasonable accommodation requirement if it creates an “undue hardship,” such as excessive 
costs or considerable work disr uption. Alleged violations of th e ADA are one of the leading perils 
covered by employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) poli cies.  
Title III of the ADA is concerned with making public and commer cial buildings physically accessible for 
disabled persons. It imposes rem odeling and reconstruction requ irements on some organizations that vary, 
depending on the primary use of each building. Some of the requ irements apply regardless of whether the 
building in question must be re modeled or rebuilt for reasons o ther than ADA compliance. Accordingly, 
the ordinance or law exclusions in 1995 and later edition Insur ance Services Office, Inc. (ISO), 
commercial property forms contain language intended to make it clear that there is no coverage for the 
cost of compliance with the ADA. 
assault —An intentional act by one person that causes a second person t o legitimately fear harm or 
unwanted contact by the first, although there is no need for ac tual physical contact between the two. 
at-will employment —Employment can be terminated for cause or for no cause, at any  time, and with no 
advance notice. The “at-will” employment doctrine is recognized  in most jurisdictions. 
battery —The intentional act of touching another person in a harmful or  offensive manner. 
BOP —See businessowners policy. 
bullying —A type of conduct in which one  person harasses another person over a time period in a 
workplace environment. Bullying is characterized by a pattern o f deliberate, hurtful, and menacing 
behaviors. Bullying can have two aspects: physical—such as maki ng intimidating physical threats, 
pushing, shoving, and invading an  individual’s personal space—o r psychological—such as emotional 
intimidation that is mostly cove rt, including joking or initiat ion rites that may mask sadistic behavior. 
Employees who claim to have been bullied by other employees are  increasingly suing employers. 
Bullying has become so common that more than 30 of states have passed anti-bullying legislation.  
112 businessowners policy (BOP) —A package policy that provides both property and liability cov erage for 
eligible small businesses. BOPs are written on special coverage  forms that are generally very similar to 
their monoline property and liability form counterparts, but th ey typically have some unique features that 
make them especially advantage ous for businesses that qualify. Both the American Association of 
Insurance Services (AAIS) and th e Insurance Services Office, In c. (ISO), offer BOP programs for use by 
their member insurers. Also, man y insurers have their own BOP p rograms. 
CGL —See commercial general liability. 
Civil Rights Act of 1991 —A federal act that broadened the scope of Title VII of the Civ il Rights Act of 
1964. The Civil Rights Act of 19 91 gives employees who sue thei r employers the right to a jury trial and 
the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages. Prior t o passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
successful claimants were entitle d only to awards of back pay a nd lost benefits and were not afforded the 
right to a jury trial. 
claims-made policy —A policy providing coverage tha t is triggered when a claim is made against the 
insured during the policy period, regardless of when the wrongf ul act that gave rise to the claim took 
place. (The one exception is when a retroactive date is applica ble to a claims-made policy. In such 
instances, the wrongful act that gave rise to the claim must ha ve taken place on or after the retroactive 
date.) Most professional, errors and omissions (E&O), directors  and officers (D&O), and employment 
practices liability insurance ( EPLI) is written as claims-made policies.  
coinsurance hammer clause —An alternative to the standard  hammer clause found within prof essional, 
directors and officers (D&O), and errors and omissions (E&O) po licy forms. Such a provision provides 
for a sharing of defense and indemnity costs (between the insur ed and the insurer) incurred after the 
insured refuses to consent to a settlement proposed by an insur er. The most common sharing percentage is 
50/50 but can sometimes go higher (e.g., 70 insurer/30 insured) . The effect of such clauses is to reduce 
the amount of indemnity and defense costs that an insured could  potentially incur if it refuses to consent 
to a settlement amount recommended by an insurer.  
common law —Unwritten law derived from cour t case decisions based on custo m and precedent. It is 
contrasted to statutory law. 
constructive discharge —An attempt by an employer to force an employee to resign (rath er than 
terminate the employee) by making the employee’s working condit ions highly disagreeable. Constructive 
discharge claims are considered a “workplace tort” and are cove red under employment practices liability 
insurance (EPLI) policies. To su stain a claim for constructive discharge, employees must establish either 
that employment conditions are personally directed at the emplo yee or that the conditions violate 
fundamental constitutional rights . (Merely unfair conditions of  employment, such as unequal pay scales 
between men and women, may not  necessarily establish a claim.) Thus, where a former police chief of 
detectives was stripped of all duties and forced to sit all day  at a desk in a windowless storage closet 
without a telephone, the court found that the employee stated a  valid claim of constructive discharge. 
D&O insurance —See directors and officers liability insurance. 
defamation —Any written or oral communication about a person or thing that  is both untrue and 
unfavorable. Media liability and general liability policies typ ically provide coverage  for claims alleging 
defamation (although general lia bility policies exclude such co verage for insureds engaged in media 
businesses). 
directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance —A type of liability insurance covering directors and 
officers for claims made against them while serving on a board of directors and/or as an officer. D&O 
liability insurance can be written to cover the directors and o fficers of for-profit businesses, privately held 
firms, not-for-profit organiza tions, and educational institutio ns. In effect, the policies function as 
“management errors and omissions  liability insurance,” covering  claims resulting from managerial  
113 decisions that have adverse fina ncial consequences. The policie s contain “shrinking limits” provisions, 
meaning that defense costs—which are often a substantial part o f a claim—reduce the policy’s limits. 
This approach contrasts with co mmercial general liability (CGL)  policies, in which defense is covered in 
addition to policy limits. Other distinctive features of D&O po licies are that they (a) are written on a 
claims-made basis, (b) usually c ontain no explicit duty to defe nd the insureds (when  covering for-profit 
businesses), and (c) cover monetary  damages but exclude bodily injury (BI) and property damage (PD).  
disability —A condition that incapacitates a person in some way so that he  or she cannot carry on normal 
pursuits. The definition of “disability” in disability income p olicies varies substantially and should be 
carefully examined. Disability may be total, partial, permanent , or temporary or a combination of these. In 
the context of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), “disa bility” is defined as a recorded or 
perceived physical or mental impairment that substantially limi ts one or more major life activities of an 
individual. 
discovery provisions —Provisions that permit insureds  to report incidents or circums tances that may 
result in claims in the futur e, found mainly in professional li ability insurance policies written with claims-
made coverage triggers. Discovery  provisions, which are also kn own as “awareness” or “notice of 
potential claim” provisions, allow an insured to lock in covera ge for such events so that coverage will 
apply under the current claims-ma de policy, regardless of how f ar in the future a cla im is eventually made 
in conjunction with the incid ent that has been reported. 
discrimination —(1) The act or process of evalua ting insurable risks and deter mining premiums on the 
basis of likelihood of loss. Insurance laws prohibit “unfair di scrimination”—that is, the formulation of 
rates on the basis of criteria that do not fairly measure the a ctual risk involved. (2) Unfair or illegal 
treatment of or denial of rights to persons on the basis of cer tain arbitrarily chosen attributes or 
characteristics, including race, g ender, religion, creed, age, medical condition, pregnancy, sexual 
orientation/preference, physical appearance, marital status, ph ysical or mental disability, or national 
origin. Discrimination does not usually fall within the coverag e terms of the commercial general liability 
(CGL) policy (and may even be specifically excluded by endorsem ent) but may be covered as a form of 
personal injury (PI) under some  umbrella policies. However, emp loyment practices liability insurance 
(EPLI) covers a variety of employ ment-related claims, including  discrimination. 
disparate impact discrimination —Discrimination claims involving apparently neutral policies th at have 
the effect of discriminating against a certain class of persons , even though such discrimination may not be 
intentional. For example, if a city required all police officer s to be at least 5’10” tall, a female applicant 
would be likely to allege disparate impact discrimination becau se the vast majority of women are 
considerably shorter. Claims alleging disparate impact discrimi nation are covered under employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. 
disparate treatment discrimination —Discrimination that involves illegal, deliberate discriminatio n 
against an individual, such as failing to promote an otherwise qualified employee based upon race, age, 
sex, or national origin. Claims alleging disparate treatment di scrimination are covered under employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. 
duty to defend —A term used to describe an insur er’s obligation to provide an insured with defense to 
claims made under a liability ins urance policy. As a general ru le, an insured need only establish that there 
is potential for coverage under a policy to give rise to the in surer’s duty to defend. Therefore, the duty to 
defend may exist even where cove rage is in doubt and ultimately  does not apply. Implicit in this rule is 
the principle that an insurer’s duty to defend an insured is br oader than its duty to indemnify. Moreover, 
an insurer may owe a duty to def end its insured against a claim  in which ultimately no damages are 
awarded, and any doubt as to whether the facts support a duty t o defend is usually resolved in the 
insured’s favor.  
114 With respect to directors and officers (D&O) and employment pra ctices liability insurance (EPLI) 
policies, policies containing explicit “duty to defend” wording  obligate an insurer to assume control of the 
claim defense process, including  selecting counsel and paying l egal bills. In contrast, non-duty to defend 
(or duty to pay) policies require only that the insurer reimbur se the insured for funds expended by the 
insured in defending a claim.  
employment-at-will doctrine —A legal doctrine holding that, a bsent a contract for a specifi ed duration, 
both employers and employees are free to terminate the employme nt relationship at any time, with or 
without cause, and with or without notice. In recent years, how ever, both courts and legislatures have 
developed a number of exceptions to this doctrine, a factor lar gely responsible for a marked increase in 
claims alleging wrongful termination. 
employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) —A type of liability insurance covering wrongful acts 
arising from the employment process. The most frequent types of  claims covered under such policies 
include wrongful termination, di scrimination, sexual harassment , and retaliation. In a ddition, the policies 
cover claims from a variety of other types of inappropriate wor kplace conduct, including (but not limited 
to) employment-related defamation, invasion of privacy, failure  to promote, deprivation of a career 
opportunity, and negligent evalua tion. The policies cover direc tors and officers, management personnel, 
and employees as insureds. The most common exclusions are for b odily injury (BI), property damage 
(PD), and intentional/dishonest acts. EPLI policies are written  on a claims-made basis. The forms contain 
“shrinking limits” provisions, meaning that insurer payment of defense costs—which are often a 
substantial part of a claim—reduce the policy’s limits. This ap proach contrasts with commercial general 
liability (CGL) policies, in whic h defense is covered in additi on to policy limits. Although EPLI is 
available as a stand-alone covera ge, it is also frequently sold  as part of a manage ment liability package 
policy. In addition to providing directors and officers (D&O) a nd fiduciary liability insurance, 
management liability package polic ies afford the option to cove r employment practices liability (EPL).  
EPL —Acronym for employment practices liability. 
EPLI —See employment practices liability insurance. 
Equal Pay Act of 1963 —A federal law prohibiting pay discrimination against employees  because of their 
gender. The Act compels businesses to pay equal wages to employ ees performing substantially equal 
work, regardless of the sex of the individual employees. Pay di fferentials may be based on merit, 
seniority, or any lawful factor other than sex. The Equal Pay A ct applies to all businesses regardless of the 
number of employees. Inequalities in pay between men and women for performance of “substantially 
equal jobs” are prohibited, unl ess the differences are due to a  factor other than sex, such as a seniority 
system or merit system. Claims alleging violation of the Equal Pay Act are covered by employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. 
ERP —See extended reporting period. 
exempt employee —An employee who is exempt from eligibility for receiving overt ime pay. 
extended reporting periods (ERP) —A designated time period after a claims-made policy has expire d 
during which a claim may be mad e and coverage triggered as if t he claim had been made during the 
policy period. 
fair employment practices laws —Legislation enacted in every st ate that bars discrimination by  private 
employers against defined categories of individuals. Fair emplo yment practices laws are generally 
broader than their federal counterparts, but they are not unifo rm in their protection. 
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 —A law that established a national, hourly minimum wage 
and promulgated eligibility rules for overtime pay. The Wage an d Hour Division of the US Department of 
Labor administers the  law, and virtually all wage and hour clai ms cite a violation of the FLSA. Wage and 
hour claims allege that workers classified by employers as “exe mpt” (and therefore ineligible for overtime  
115 pay) are, in fact, entitled to ove rtime pay. Wage and hour clai ms are a serious exposure for employers; a 
number of class action wage and hour claims have settled for mo re than $10 million. 
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 —A law allowing employees to take up to 12 weeks 
annually of job-protected unpaid leave. Such leaves are permitt ed in the event of a serious illness of the 
employee or family member or the birth or placement (through ad option or foster care) of a child. The 
law applies to employers having 50 or more employees and to emp loyees who have worked for the 
employer for a minimum of 1,250 hours during the prior year. Ch arges of discrimination against those 
taking leave under the Act (or by those prevented from taking l eave under the Act) can be filed with the 
Department of Labor, which investigates and enforces claims. In  addition, an employee can sue his or her 
employer individually. Such claims are covered by employment pr actices liability (EPL) policies. 
FLSA —See Fair Labor Standards Act. 
FMLA —See Family and Medical Leave Act. 
fraud —Deception or artifice used to cheat or intentionally mislead. This is closely related to 
misrepresentation and concealme nt. Proof of fraudulent acts by an insured in procuring insurance may 
lead to a denial of coverage and voiding of the policy by the i nsurer. As a loss exposure, certain types of 
fraud can be insured by a commerc ial crime insurance policy. 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 —A law that prohibits the improper use 
of genetic information in both health insurance underwriting an d pricing and in employment decisions. 
The Act prohibits health insurers from denying coverage to a he althy individual or charging that person 
higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to dev eloping a disease in the future. The 
legislation also bars employers from using individuals’ genetic  information when making hiring, firing, 
job placement, or promotion deci sions. Here is an example of ho w the law might apply in an employment 
scenario. A company requires preemployment physicals as a condi tion of employment. The results of a 
prospective employee’s physical examination indicate that she i s healthy and fully capable of performing 
the job duties for the particul ar position for which she had be en hired. However, the examination also 
revealed that she has a genetic  predisposition for developing b reast cancer. Under GINA, the employer 
would not be able to deny the person the job, despite such a pr edisposition. 
GINA— See Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
hammer clause —A provision (also known as the “blackmail settlement clause”) found in professional 
liability insurance policies that  requires an insurer to seek a n insured’s approval prior to settling a claim 
for a specific amount. However, if the insured does not approve  the recommended figure, the consent to 
settlement clause states that the insurer will not be liable fo r any additional monies r equired to settle the 
claim or for the defense costs that accrue from the point after  the insurer makes the settlement 
recommendation.  
hostile work environment sexual harassment —A form of sexual harassment occurring when such 
conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering w ith an individual’s work performance or 
creating an intimidating, hostile , or offensive working environ ment. Coverage for suc h claims is covered 
under employment practices liability (EPL) policies. 
independent contractor —An individual or company that has signed an agreement with ano ther party to 
perform some job or function on behalf of that party without th e direction or oversight of the party. As 
respects workers compensation, m any states have established cri teria that determine whether an 
individual is functioning as an i ndependent contractor or emplo yee. A worker classified as an independent 
contractor and not an employee is ineligible to receive benefit s under the workers compensation policy of 
the other party. Despite the rules established, the delineation  of an independent contractor remains in 
many jurisdictions a legal ambiguity.  
116 Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) —An organization that collects statistical data, promulgates ra ting 
information, develops standard policy forms, and files informat ion with state regulators on behalf of 
insurance companies th at purchase its services. 
insured versus insured exclusion —An exclusion found in directors and officers (D&O) liability p olicies 
(and to a lesser extent in other types of professional liabilit y coverage). The exclu sion precludes coverage 
for claims by one director or officer against another. The purp ose of this exclusion is to eliminate 
coverage for four types of situations: (1) employment practices  claims, (2) internal di sputes/infighting, (3) 
claims involving collusion, and (4) claims by organizations aga inst their directors and officers for 
imprudent business practices. 
invasion of privacy —Violation of a person’s right to be left alone. Invasion of pr ivacy is considered a 
“traditional” personal injury ( PI) tort. Coverage for PI is exc luded in some umbrella and professional 
liability coverage forms, althoug h it is covered under commerci al general liability (CGL) policies, in 
police liability policies, within liability policies designed f or media firms, in employment practices 
liability (EPL) policies, and in a  number of lawyers profession al liability policy forms. 
ISO—See Insurance Services Office, Inc. 
misrepresentation —A false or misleading statement that, if intentional and mater ial, can allow the 
insurer to void the insurance c ontract. Some insurance policies  and state laws that govern insurance 
contract provisions vary on the  exact details of the conditions  under which coverage may be voided; these 
variations are usually denoted in state amendatory endorsements .  
most favored venue wording —A provision found within some directors and officers (D&O), 
professional, and employment practices liability (EPL) policies  stating that, with respect to the 
insurability of punitive damages, the law of the jurisdiction m ost favorable to the insurability of punitive 
damages will apply, provided the jurisdiction meets one of the following criteria. It is the jurisdiction 
where (a) the punitive damages we re awarded; (b) the act giving  rise to the punitive damages award 
occurred; (c) the insured is inco rporated or maintains its prin cipal place of business; o r (d) the insurer is 
incorporated or maintains its p rincipal place of business. When  this provision is included within a policy 
that affirmatively covers (or does not exclude) punitive damage s, it provides assurance that such damages 
will be covered by the insurer , despite the fact that covering punitive damages is contra ry to law in certain 
jurisdictions (e.g., California) . Most favored venue wording me rely modifies the existing level of 
coverage for punitive damages already provided by a policy. Suc h wording does not provide coverage if 
the policy otherwise excludes punitive damages. It is also impo rtant to recognize that the validity of this 
provision has not been tested in court. 
negligence —A tort involving failure to use a degree of care considered re asonable under a given set of 
circumstances. Acts of either omission or commission or both ma y constitute negligence. The four 
elements of negligence are a dut y owed to a plaintiff, a breach  of that duty by the defendant, proximate 
cause, and an injury or damage suffered by the plaintiff. Liabi lity policies are designed to cover claims of 
negligence. 
negligent retention —A type of employment-related claim in which a plaintiff assert s that an employer 
failed to discharge an employee who management knew or should h ave known had a propensity toward 
violence, sexual harassment, or dishonesty. For example, neglig ent retention claims are often made after 
an employee commits a mass shooti ng at a plant or office. Injur ed workers then sue the employer, 
alleging that the company was negligent in not terminating the employee sooner. The basis of the 
claimants’ argument is that, on prior occasions, the employee h ad provided clear evidence of a propensity 
for such violence (e.g., he had issued threats or brought a wea pon onto the company’s premises). 
Coverage for such claims is ava ilable under employment practice s liability insurance (EPLI) policies.  
non-duty to defend language —See duty to defend.  
117 nonexempt employee —An employee who is eligible for overtime pay. 
nonpecuniary relief —Relief not involving money dama ges, such as reinstating a wron gfully terminated 
employee. 
post-judgment interest —Interest accrued between the t ime of the judgment and the time  of payment. 
prejudgment interest —Interest accruing on the amount of a legal award from the time  of the injury or 
damage to the time the judgment is entered by the court. Prejud gment interest, when awarded as part of a 
judgment against the insured, is covered by the supplementary p ayments provision of standard general 
liability policies. 
public policy exception —A common law remedy to the employment-at-will doctrine that ha s been 
created by the judicial system. Courts in various jurisdictions  have recognized that an employee should 
not be terminated for exercising rights under other laws that w ere enacted to protect the employee. An 
example of a wrongful termination suit that has been allowed in volved the firing of an employee for 
missing a week of work to serve on jury duty. 
punitive damages —Damages in excess of those require d to compensate the plaintif f for the wrong done, 
which are imposed in order to p unish the defendant because of t he particularly wanton or willful nature of 
his or her wrongdoing. Also called “exemplary damages.” Althoug h the standard commercial general 
liability (CGL) policy and business auto policy (BAP) contain n o punitive damage exclusion, many 
umbrella and excess liability polic ies contain such an exclusio n. 
quid pro quo sexual harassment —A form of sexual harassment, s uch as unwelcome sexual advances  or 
requests for sexual favors when  (1) submission to such conduct is made a condition of an individual’s 
employment, and (2) submission to  or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment 
decisions affecting the indivi dual who is receiving such advanc es or requests. Claims alleging quid pro 
quo sexual harassment are afforded  coverage under employment pr actices liability (EPL) policies. 
reasonable accommodation —As defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 199 0, either 
modifications or adjustments to a job application process or a job performance process that enable a 
qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for or p erform the position or modifications or 
adjustments that allow the disabled worker the same benefits an d privileges afforded other similarly 
situated employees without disabilities. This modification or j ob adjustment must be achieved without 
imposing an undue hardship on the employer’s operations. 
retaliation claims —Such claims result when an employee alleges discrimination bas ed on protected 
status (e.g., race, gender, di sability), and, in retaliation fo r making such a claim, the employee is treated 
adversely (e.g., the employee r eceives a demotion). A successfu l retaliation claim must prove three 
elements: (1) that the employee engaged in a “protected activit y” (filing a discrimination claim, alleging 
corporate misconduct), (2) that the employee suffered an “adver se action” (termination), and (3) that there 
was a causal connection between t he adverse action and the prot ected activity. Employment practices 
liability insurance (EPLI) policies cover retaliation claims. I n recent years, retaliation claims have also 
been made in conjunction with wor kers compensation claims. That  is, employees have sued their 
employers when, in response to f iling a workers compensation cl aim, an employer took some form of 
adverse action against the worker  (e.g., imposing a change in w ork hours, giving the employee a 
demotion or a reprimand). 
retroactive date —A provision found in many (although not all) claims-made polic ies that eliminates 
coverage for claims produced by wrongful acts that took place p rior to a specified date, even if the claim 
is first made during the policy period. 
For example, a January 1, 2010 , retroactive date in a policy wr itten with a January 1 , 2010–2011, term, 
would bar coverage for claims resulting from wrongful acts that  took place prior to January 1, 2010, even  
118 if claims (resulting from such acts) are made against the insur ed during the January 1, 2010–2011, policy 
period. 
There are two purposes of retroactive dates: (1) to eliminate c overage for situations or incidents known to 
insureds that have the potential to give rise to claims in the future and (2) to preclude coverage for “stale” 
claims that arise from events far in the past, even if such eve nts are unknown to the insured. In the former 
case, the retroactive date preserves the principle of “fortuity ”—that is, the insurer should not be called 
upon to cover the so-called burning building. In the latter ins tance, the retroactive date makes policies 
more affordable by precluding co verage for events that, while i nsurable, are remote in time.  
sexual harassment —Conduct involving unwelcome sexua l advances, requests for sexu al favors, and 
verbal, visual, or physical conduc t of a sexual nature. There a re two types of sexual harassment: quid pro 
quo sexual harassment, in which sexual contact is made a condit ion of employment, and hostile 
environment sexual harassment, in which such conduct creates an  intimidating, hostile, or offensive 
working environment. Lawsuits against businesses that allege se xual harassment have increased 
significantly during the past decade. Accordingly, around 1990,  the insurance market began offering 
employment practices liability ( EPL) policies, a specialized fo rm of insurance covering claims of sexual 
harassment as well as other employment-related torts. 
third-party claims —Liability claims brought by pers ons allegedly injured or harme d by the insured. The 
insured is the first party, the insurer is the second party, an d the claimant is the third party. 
third-party liability coverage —In general, any type of insur ance covering the legal liability  of one party 
to another party. For example, c ommercial general, business aut o, and errors and omissions (E&O) 
liability policies all provide third-party liability coverage. In the context of employment practices liability 
(EPL) insurance, a so-called thir d-party liability coverage opt ion is sometimes available to address claims 
made by nonemployees (e.g., custo mers, vendors, clients) agains t the insured company that arise from 
acts committed by employees. Most often, third-party claims all ege some form of either discrimination or 
harassment. The majority of EPL policies do not explicitly cove r third-party claims, although most 
insurers will provide such coverage by endorsement. 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 —A law prohibiting discrimination by private sector 
employers. Title VII bars an employer from discriminating on th e basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin in hiring, discharge, or compensation and with regard to any term s, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. An “employer” is defined under Title VII as any person “engaged in an 
industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for ea ch working day in each of 20 or more 
calendar weeks in the current o r preceding calendar year.” An “ employer” can be a sole proprietor, 
partnership, or corporation. A partner is not considered an emp loyee under Title VII. The majority of 
employment-related lawsuits alleging discrimination are brought  under Title VII. 
unconscious bias —A type of employment-related claim alleging that, with respect  to promotions, raises, 
and job offers, Caucasian men ine vitably slight women and minor ities, because they use preconceived 
stereotypes in evaluating such  persons, despite their conscious  efforts to do otherwise. The leading 
proponent of this theory is soc iologist William Bielby, who reg ularly testifies on behalf of employee 
plaintiffs in major employment discrimination cases (including those against Wal-Mart, FedEx, and 
Johnson & Johnson). As an example  of unconscious bias, Bielby’s  research found that, in identifying 
candidates for management positions requiring relocation, hirin g managers systematically excluded 
women from consideration because they reflexively assumed that women weren’t interested in jobs 
requiring them to move long distances. Critics of unconscious b ias claims assert that, while stereotypes 
are admittedly involved in inter actions between strangers, when  a Caucasian manager has known an 
employee for a significant time period, he will apply what is r eferred to as “individuating information,” 
thereby allowing him to make obj ective decisions on the basis o f the employee’s individual skills and 
abilities, rather than on gender or racial stereotypes.  
119 Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USER RA) of 1994 —A federal law 
intended to ensure that persons who serve in the Armed Forces, Reserves, National Guard, or other 
“uniformed services” (1) are not d isadvantaged in their civilia n careers because of their service; (2) are 
promptly reemployed in their civ ilian jobs upon their return fr om duty; and (3) are not discriminated 
against in employment based on past, present, or future militar y service. Essentially, the Act requires 
employers to allow those who have served on active duty to go b ack to the same job and at the same pay 
after they return from such active duty service. The Act does, however, contain two important exceptions 
for employers under which employers are not required to reemplo y a service man or woman, specifically 
when (1) the employer experien ces “changed circumstances” (e.g. , during a company-wide layoff) and (2) 
when there is “undue hardship” (e.g., the employer is facing se vere financial difficulties). 
USERRA —See Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.  
wage and hour claims —An assertion by an employee-plaintiff that his or her employer  has failed to pay 
overtime wages owed to the employee. Within the past several ye ars, a number of high-profile, high-
dollar wage and hour claims have  been filed on a class action b asis, a fact that has vastly increased the 
dollar amount payable under such lawsuits. Given the magnitude of this exposure, most employment 
practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies specifically excl ude coverage for wage and hour claims. 
WARN Act exclusion —An exclusion found in  employment practices liability insurance  (EPLI) policies. 
Under the federal Workers’ Adjus tment Retraining Notification ( WARN) Act, employers of 100 or more 
persons are required to give th eir workers specific notice peri ods prior to various types of mass layoffs or 
plant closings. The majority of  employment practices liability (EPL) policies preclude coverage for 
claims alleging failure to provi de such notice as required by t he WARN Act. The rationale for this 
exclusion is that such claims ar e within the insured’s control and therefore are preventable. 
whistleblower claim —An assertion that an employee w as penalized (e.g., terminated,  demoted, 
disciplined) for complaining of or opposing certain employer ac tions (e.g., fraudulent billing practices on 
a government contract), refusing to engage in illegal or unethi cal conduct, or exposing such conduct via 
testimony at a trial or administr ative hearing. Whistleblower c laims are a type of retaliation claim and are 
covered by employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) poli cies. 
whistleblower statutes —Laws that protect employees fro m retaliatory actions by their employer when 
the employees report violations of law by their employer. In ad dition to federal statutes, many states also 
have passed laws prohibiting an employer from firing or otherwi se retaliating against an employee for 
disclosing an unfair or illegal practice by the employer. Emplo yment practices liability (EPL) policies 
cover so-called whistleblower claims, whereby an employee asser ts that he or she was retaliated against 
for whistleblowing. 
wrongful hiring claims —Claims resulting when a former employer knowingly gives favora ble 
references concerning a former problematic employee to a compan y that hires that former employee. The 
hiring company then sues the form er employer for providing a kn owingly false reference. 
wrongful termination —The act of terminating an emplo yee in a manner that is against  the law. In recent 
years, erosion of the employment-at-will doctrine has been the factor most responsible for the increase in 
claims alleging wrongful termination. Coverage for this exposur e is provided under employment practices 
liability (EPL) policies.
