1 Introduction 
This course is designed to give a moderately experienced insura nce person a detailed look at (1) the 
fiduciary liability exposures tha t were created by the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 
of 1974 and (2) the insurance po licies that have been developed  to cover these liability exposures. 
The first part of the course d escribes the basic fiduciary duti es set forth in ERISA, examines the specific 
types of pension and benefit plans governed by ERISA, and analy zes the particular claims exposures 
created by these duties. Next, the course discusses the way in which fiduciary liability insurance is 
underwritten, provides methods o f controlling exposures to fidu ciary liability claims, and explains how 
fiduciary liability coverage is coordinated with other types of  management liability insurance policies. 
The second part of the course takes a detailed look at the spec ific provisions within fiduciary liability 
insurance policy forms, includi ng insuring agreements, covered persons/organizations, provisions 
pertaining to status changes, k ey definitions, limits/deductibl es, conditions, exclusions, and coverage 
triggers. 
 Chapter 1 explains the specific fiduciary duties enumerated wit hin ERISA. These include how the 
law defines a “fiduciary,” the s tandards of care required by fi duciaries, responsibility for outside 
service providers, prohibited transactions, and bonding require ments. 
 Chapter 2 enumerates the types of benefit plans to which ERISA applies. It also describes the 
plans that are exempt from ERISA regulations. 
 Chapter 3 discusses the liability exposures that result from th e three major types of employee 
pension plans: (1) defined benefit, (2) defined contribution, a nd (3) cash balance plans. Particular 
focus is directed to exposures from 401(k) plans and the proble ms resulting from the holding of 
company stock in these accounts. 
 Chapter 4 explores the key factors that insurers use to price a nd underwrite fiduciary liability 
coverage. The factors discussed i nclude funding adequacy, natur e of the plans covered, single 
versus multiemployer plans, and the profiles of covered fiducia ries. 
 Chapter 5 describes how to redu ce the exposures to liability cl aims that are made against 
fiduciaries. Specific techniques, such as periodic audits and t he use of experts to design plans, are 
discussed in detail. 
 Chapter 6 explains how to coordi nate fiduciary liability polici es with other related coverages, 
including employee benefits lia bility endorsements to commercia l general liability (CGL) 
policies. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of  including fiduciary liability 
coverage within so-called manage ment liability package policy f orms. 
 Chapter 7, which begins the detailed discussion of fiduciary li ability policy forms, addresses the 
two major insuring agreements w ithin the policies: (1) coverage  for fiduciary liability and (2) 
coverage for claims adjudicated  under what are known as “volunt ary settlement programs,” as 
well as the key coverage extensi ons available within fiduciary liability policies. This chapter also 
examines the covered persons and covered organizations provisio ns of the policy. 
 Chapter 8 reviews the manner in  which coverage applies for “sta tus changes,” such as the 
addition of employee benefit plan s (e.g., when an insured corpo ration acquires another 
corporation) and the termination of such plans.  
2  Chapter 9 explains how fiduciary  liability policies define and apply several key terms, including 
covered losses, claim, policy territory, defense costs, and cla im settlement procedures. 
 Chapter 10 describes the functioni ng of a fiduciary liability p olicy’s limits and 
retentions/deductibles provisions . Particular attention is paid  to how they apply in claim situations 
involving multiple claimants, a common characteristic of fiduci ary liability claims. 
 Chapter 11 describes the importa nt policy conditions found with in fiduciary liability forms, in 
particular, subrogation/recourse and severability. 
 Chapter 12 looks at the key excl usions found within fiduciary l iability policies, discusses the 
rationale for each, and addresses the subtle but critical varia tions within the same exclusion 
contained in the different insurers’ policies. 
 Chapter 13 analyzes the manner in  which a fiduciary liability p olicy’s coverage triggers apply. 
Within this context, concepts suc h as claims first made, post-p olicy reporting windows, 
retroactive dates, discovery p rovisions, and extended reporting  and runoff periods are treated at 
length. 
A glossary following Chapter 13 defines the key terms and phras es and the acronyms used in this course. 
Check the glossary if you are unsure of the meaning of a term o r if you have forgotten what an acronym 
stands for.

4 Chapter 1 
Fiduciaries and Their Duties under ERISA 
Overview 
Chapter 1 examines the specific duties enumerated by the Employ ee Retirement Income Security Act 
(ERISA) of 1974, to which fiduciaries must adhere. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the purpose and the basic functions of the Employee R etirement Income Security Act 
(ERISA), 
 recognize parties that qualify as fiduciaries according to the ERISA definition, 
 identify the standards of care required of ERISA fiduciaries, 
 recognize factors affecting a fiduciary’s liability, 
 recognize ERISA’s specific bonding requirements that apply to f iduciaries, and 
 distinguish between fiducia ry and settlor functions. 
Origins of ERISA 
The impetus for passage of ERISA was the closure of Studebaker- Packard Corporation’s South Bend, 
Indiana, manufacturing plant in December 1963, due to financial  difficulties. At the time of its closure, 
the company’s pension plan was grossly underfunded, and rather than paying out only partial benefits 
during an extended period of time , Studebaker’s workers were pa id lump sum payments representing only 
a fraction of the pension benef its they had earned during their  tenures with the company. Thousands more 
workers received no lump sum payments at all. Studebaker’s misf ortunes highlighted the need for 
legislation aimed at safeguardi ng and protecting pensions and b enefits earned by and owed to workers. 
The collapse of the Studebaker pe nsion plan focused legislative  attention of the issu e of securing pension 
and benefit programs. In respon se, a number of bills were intro duced in the United States Congress to 
accomplish this goal. However, opp osition to such legislation b y both business and la bor groups (each of 
which sought the flexibility in benefit program design and admi nistration afforded during the pre-ERISA 
era) caused these legislative initiatives to stall for more tha n a decade. Eventually, the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act o f 1974 was passed. ERISA establ ished standards for private sector 
pension, health, and other employee benefit plans and increased  protections for plan participants and their 
families.1 
Responsibility for the interpreta tion and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of 
Labor, Department of the Treasury (especially the Internal Reve nue Service (IRS)), and the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  
5 The law created numerous fiducia ry liability exposures for empl oyers that offered these plans, and, in 
response, fiduciary liability in surance coverage became availab le on a widespread basis during the mid-
1970s. Yet, even before passage of ERISA, employers owed employ ees a common law duty to avoid 
clear errors and omissions (the commission of which subjected t hem to liability for damages resulting 
from their negligence) in managing employee benefit plans. For example, even without ERISA, 
employers were required to enroll employees in benefit programs  for which they were eligible, make 
changes in beneficiary designati ons as requested by beneficiari es of such programs, and issue payments 
of benefits due to employees as specified by the programs. So e ven before ERISA’s passage, employers 
could be held liable for errors  and omissions they committed in  conjunction with employee benefit plan 
administration. ERISA simply formalized these duties. 
In addition, the law heightened t he standards of conduct to whi ch persons responsible for managing such 
programs would be held and made fiduciaries personally  liable when their failure to comply with the 
law’s requirements harmed the ben eficiaries of employee benefit  plans. 
Purpose of ERISA 
ERISA does not require employers to establish or create benefit  or pension plans for their workers. Nor 
does it decree minimum benefit le vels if such plans have been e stablished. Rather, the essence of ERISA 
is that it regulates the manner in which pension and benefit pr ograms (which, for examp le, include but are 
not limited to 401(k) plans) must operate once they have been p ut into place. Thus, under ERISA, pension 
plans are required to provide vested benefits for employees aft er a certain number of years. (Benefits are 
“vested” when they become the l egal property of the designated beneficiary. For example, under most 
corporate 401(k) savings plans, the portion contributed by the employer normally requires a 3-to-5-year 
period before such contributions  become vested; that is, when t he contributions become the legal property 
of the employee on whose behalf  the contributions were made.) E RISA also mandates that such plans 
meet certain minimum  funding requirements. 
ERISA set forth a broad scope o f fiduciary obligations. Accordi ngly, the Act created numerous liability 
exposures for individuals and companies that create and manage pension and employee benefit plans. The 
purpose of ERISA was to develop guidelines for administering su ch plans so that the interests of 
employee beneficiaries would be safeguarded. In effect, ERISA i s designed to ensure that those entitled to 
pensions and benefits are  able to collect them. 
Fiduciaries as Defined by ERISA 
According to ERISA’s provisions, persons working within busines s organizations that design, administer, 
and manage pension and employee benefit plans are fiduciaries. Additionally, there are financial 
institutions (e.g., banks, insurance companies) and individuals  (e.g., attorneys, act uaries, consultants, 
investment advisers) who also perform fiduciary duties in conju nction with the pension and employee 
benefit plans sponsored by client  companies. As detailed by ERI SA, an individual or corporation is 
considered a fiduciary if that p erson or corporation does any o f the following. 
1. Exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control in managing the pension or benefit 
plan or exercises any authority o r control in managing or dispo sing of its assets 
2. Renders investment advice for a f ee or other compensation, with  respect to any monies or other 
property belonging to the plan 
3. Has any discretionary authority o r responsibility in administer ing the plan 
Personal Liability of Fiduciaries under ERISA 
One key aspect of ERISA is tha t it makes fiduciaries personally  liable for breaches of duty. Prior to 
ERISA, there was no personal liability associated with manageme nt of employee pension and benefit  
6 plans. Although the fiduciary liability exposure actually exist ed prior to the passage of ERISA, ERISA 
not only formalized the law asso ciated with the administration of employee pension and benefit plans. It 
also broadened the scope of such  liability so that it became a “personal” rather than simply a “corporate” 
liability, meaning that the personal assets of a fiduciary can be confiscated to restore any losses suffered 
by a covered plan if the fiduci ary’s negligence caused the loss es. For example, if Joe Smith, the 
comptroller at Corporation X, who is also a trustee of the corp oration’s pension plan, is held liable for an 
error that causes a loss to that plan, Joe’s personal assets co uld be seized to cover the loss. In other words, 
in addition to Corporation X’s assets, Joe’s assets, since he i s a fiduciary, are also exposed to liability 
claims. This is illustrated in Exhibit 1.1. 
Exhibit 1.1 
Personal Liability of Fiduciaries under ERISA 
Sec. 1109. Liability for breach of fiduciary duty  
Any person who is a fiduciary wi th respect to a plan who breach es any of the 
responsibilities, ob ligations or duties im posed upon fiduciarie s by this subchapter shall 
be personally liable to make good  to such plan any losses to th e plan resulting from

Expanding Definitions of Fiduciari es To Include Corporate Directors 
With the incidence of what are known as ERISA “stock drop” clai ms (discussed later in this course), a 
number of courts have broadened the definition of “fiduciary” t o include the sponsor corporation’s board 
of directors or its compensation committee—if the directors hav e the authority to appoint persons who 
serve as fiduciaries of the plan. (Note: an example of a leadin g “stock drop” claim involved Enron 
Corporation, when during the early 2000s the value of Enron sto ck dropped massively, in response to the 
disclosure of problems that preceded the company’s bankruptcy.)  Given their power to appoint 
fiduciaries, some courts have r easoned that corporate directors  have a continuing duty to oversee the 
performance of those they have appointed to these positions. (I n most corporations, executive officers, 
such as the CEO, chief operating officer, and chief financial o fficer, as well as high-level managers, such 
as the human resources manager or director of employee benefits , are appointed as the trustees of 
corporate benefit plans.) 
Standards of Care Required of ERISA Fiduciaries 
The ERISA law represents an attempt by the US Congress to codif y the common law standard for 
fiduciary conduct that evolved from the law of trusts. Although  ERISA speaks in terms of the “prudent 
man standard of care,” it compels a broader and more stringent standard of conduct than mere 
“prudence.” Rather, the standard  to be met is one of a prudent fiduciary—not a prudent man. More 
specifically, ERISA imposes certain standards of care on fiduci aries. These are noted in Exhibit 1.2.  
7 Exhibit 1.2 
Standards of Care ERISA Imposes on Fiduciaries 
 Exclusive Purpose . Fiduciaries must discharge th eir duties with respect to a pla n, solely 
in the interest of the plan’s par ticipants and beneficiaries. 
 Prudence . Fiduciaries must discharge thei r duties “with the care, skill , prudence, and 
diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a pruden t man acting in a like 
capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduc t of an enterprise of a like 
character and with like aims.” 
 Diversification . Fiduciaries must diversify the investments of the plan so as to minimize 
the risk of large losses, unless , under the circumstances, it i s clearly prudent not to do so. 
 Plan Documents . Fiduciaries are required to discharge their duties in accorda nce with the 
documents and instrument s governing the plan. 
Responsibility for Outside Service Providers 
It is important to note that unde r ERISA, a fiduciary can also be held liable for the acts, errors, and 
omissions of a cofiduciary (also known as an outside service pr ovider). Thus, organizations sponsoring 
employee pension and benefit programs are exposed to claims cau sed by the actions of outside entities 
and organizations that provide a dministrative services for the plans they sponsor. Given the complexity of 
many pension and benefit programs, a variety of specialized exp ertise is typically required to operate such 
programs, and a number of differe nt firms may be involved in se rvicing a firm’s pension and benefits 
programs. The assortment of entities commonly providing such ex pertise is enumerated in Exhibit 1.3. 
   
8 Exhibit 1.3 
Outside Entities Servicing Pension and Benefit Plans 
Consulting Firms  that possess specialized expert ise regarding ERISA are called on to design 
and implement pension and benefit plans. 
Professional Administration Firms  are in the business of perform ing the day-to-day paperwork 
functions required by benefit p lans (e.g., enrollment, claims p rocessing and payments, record 
keeping, filing reports wi th government agencies). 
Actuarial Consulting Firms  must periodically review curren t pension fund reserve levels a nd 
certify that such reserves, cou pled with predicted future contr ibutions and expected investment 
returns, will be adequate to mee t anticipated payments to plan beneficiaries when they retire. 
Certified Public Acc ountant (CPA) Firms  perform annual audits of the plans to ascertain that 
financial statements accurately  present the true condition of t he plans and that the statements 
have been prepared in a ccordance with gene rally accepted accoun ting principles (GAAP). 
Law Firms  must review and analyze all impor tant documents associated wit h the plans and 
ultimately render an opinion r egarding the ext ent to which they  comply with ERISA. 
Investment Advisers  assist fiduciaries in establishing investment guidelines and i n retaining 
and reviewing the performance of investment managers. 
Investment Management Companies  are charged with the duty of investing the assets of 
plans. In accordance with inves tment objectives of the plan as specified in the plan documents, 
the managers must achieve optimal  levels of diversification, ca pital preservation, and rates of 
return. 
Bank Trust Departments  are typically in actual possessi on of invested funds (or evide nce of 
those funds in the form of stock  certificates and bonds, for in stance) and may participate in the 
investment decision-making proce ss. Sometimes they work in conj unction with an independent 
investment management firm. In ot her instances, they are also r esponsible for actually making 
investment decisions. 
Protection from Liability: The  Investment Company Act of 1940 
Despite a fiduciary’s responsib ility for the actions of outside  service providers, it should be understood 
that ERISA does provide fiduciaries with a layer of insulation from liability. Specifically, if it can be 
shown that the fiduciary selected  an investment adviser who is registered under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, the fiduciary cannot be held liable for the invest ment adviser’s imprudent investment 
decisions. In effect, liability can only attach when it can be shown that the fiduciary negligently selected 
the adviser, because it failed to select an adviser who is regi stered under the 1940 Act. 
Nevertheless, if a fiduciary is sued for the negligent acts of an incompetent outside service provider and 
raises the Investment Company Act as a defense, the fiduciary w ill still be required to pay defense costs 
associated with lawsuits of this  kind. Accordingly, fiduciary l iability insurance policies (which are 
addressed beginning in Chapter 7 of this course) explicitly cov er such defense costs. Although as will also 
be explained in Chapter 10, the  expenditure of such costs reduc es policy limits, a factor that heightens the 
importance of selecting competent outside service providers. 
“Function” versus “Category”  Determines Liability 
It is important to recognize, however, that depending on the sp ecific nature of their duties, not all of the 
persons and entities listed in Exhi bit 1.3 will be considered f iduciaries under ERISA in every instance. 
This is because “function” rather than “category” is what ultim ately controls the question of “who is a 
fiduciary?” For example, a bank that merely holds securities fo r safekeeping but plays no role in the 
actual investment decision-making process would probably not be  considered a fiduciary. In contrast, a 
bank performing both of these rol es would almost certainly be c onsidered a fiduciary to the extent of its 
involvement in the decision-making process.  
9 Prohibited Transactions Involving Benefit Plans 
ERISA specifies two kinds of prohibited transactions. 
 Self-Dealing . Fiduciaries are prohibited from using plan assets to profit p ersonally (e.g., investing 
pension plan monies in a company in which a fiduciary holds a m ajority interest). 
 Party-in-Interest Transactions . Otherwise legitimate transactions are prohibited if the 
transaction is conducted with a “pa rty-in-interest.” A “party-i n-interest” includes any fiduciary, 
legal counsel, employee of the plan, service provider to the pl an, employer, or employee whose 
employees or members are covered by the plan, and any other per son who has a stated interest in 
or a relationship with a party-i n-interest. For example, pensio n plan funds cannot be used to buy 
or sell property to or from or invest any assets with any famil y member of any trustee or anyone 
else who is a party-in-interest. 
Penalties for Engaging in Prohibited Transactions 
In the event that a plan engages in a prohibited transaction, i t will not be disqualified, although an IRS 50 
percent excise tax will automatically be levied. This tax rises  to 100 percent if the situation is not 
corrected within a certain period of time (usually within 90 da ys). In addition, the Department of Labor 
imposes a 20 percent penalty based on the amount of the fiducia ry’s breach. 
Exceptions to Prohibited Transactions 
To carve out those prohibited transactions that come within the  literal language of ERISA but are not 
intended to be prohibited, Congress created certain statutory e xceptions to what would otherwise be 
considered prohibited transactions. Some of these include (1) e xemptions that permit the rendering of 
reasonable and necessary services, (2) the collection and compr omise of disputes concerning delinquent 
contributions from participati ng employers, (3) the sale of sec urities of parties in interest, and (4) the 
receipt of reasonable compensation by certain parties in intere st. 
Bonding Requirements under ERISA 
Under ERISA, and effective Dece mber 31, 2007, all fiduciaries a nd persons who handle plan funds or 
other plan assets must be bonded for 10 percent of the aggregat e amount handled, with a minimum bond 
of $1,000 and a maximum bond of $1 million. 
It is the insured organization’s responsibility to make certain  that all employees with access to plan funds 
are appropriately bonded. Howev er, fidelity bonding is not requ ired of corporate trustees or insurance 
companies with combined capital and surplus of at least $1 mill ion, if the only assets from which benefits 
are paid are the general assets of the insured organization or a union. Nor is fidelity bonding required if 
the secretary of labor finds tha t other bonding arrangements or  the overall condition of the plan are 
adequate to protect participants. 
Compliance by Endorsement to  Corporate Cr ime Policy 
Compliance with these bonding rul es can be attained by attachin g an ERISA Compliance Bond to a 
company’s existing crime policy, assuming the policy covers emp loyee dishonesty. In effect, compliance 
does not require the purchase of a separate insurance policy or  bond. Nor can compliance be achieved by 
purchasing fiduciary liability insurance, which cannot be used to satisfy these bonding requirements. 
Interestingly, financial institutions are granted a “regulatory  exemption” from these mandatory bonding 
requirements, most likely because financial institutions almost  universally maintain ample employee 
dishonesty coverage. ERISA Comp liance Bonds, which, as mentione d above, are merely endorsements to 
existing crime policies, cover losses caused by dishonest acts committed by trustees, officers, employees, 
administrators, or managers of insured plans.  
10 Fiduciary Liability, Employee Be nefits Liability, and ERISA Bon ding Requirements 
Compared 
There is often confusion regarding the difference between fiduc iary liability insurance, employee benefits 
liability insurance, and the bonding requirements under ERISA. 
 Fiduciary liability insurance  covers claims alleging breach of discretionary duties specifie d by 
the 1974 ERISA law (e.g., failure to invest plan assets prudent ly, failure to select a qualified 
service provider to a covered plan). Insureds under fiduciary l iability policies include both the 
corporate entity that sponsors t he covered plans as well as the  individuals who serve as fiduciaries 
of such plans. 
 Employee benefits liability  results from nondiscretionary, ad ministrative errors associate d with 
pension and benefit plans (e.g ., failing to name an intended be neficiary on a life insurance policy, 
failure to enroll an employee in a company 401(k) plan). Import antly, liability for these types of 
errors and omissions is not based upon, specified within, or cr eated by ERISA. Rather, such 
liability is a function of common law and existed prior to the passage of ERISA in 1974. As will 
be discussed shortly, in additi on to covering the liabilities s et forth within ERISA, fiduciary 
liability insurance policies also cover employee benefits liabi lity exposures. Furthermore, within 
commercial general liability (CGL) policy forms, endorsements a re available that cover employee 
benefits liability exposures (although such endorsements do not  cover fiduciary liability 
exposures.) 
 ERISA bonding requirements  apply to fidelity/dishonesty in handling pension and benefit p lan 
funds and are designed to protect  against a fiduciary’s illegal  appropriation of those funds from 
an employee benefit plan. These requirements necessitate purcha sing an ERISA Compliance 
Bond, which, as explained above, can be secured by endorsement to a corporate crime policy. 
Exhibit 1.4 illustrates the three types of claim situations tha t would be covered under these different 
policies.

Other Important Sections of ERISA  
Two additional, key sections of the ERISA law require mention: Section 404(c) and Section 510. 
  
 
11 ERISA Section 404(c)   
Section 404(c) of ERISA protects a fiduciary against liability for investment losses arising from allocation 
choices in employee-directed re tirement plans (e.g., 401(k) pla ns) if the following requirements are met. 
 Plan participants can allocate f unds among a minimum of three i nvestment choices with 
substantially different risk and return characteristics. For in stance, a 401(k) plan that offered 
mutual funds invested in US stocks, international stocks, and b onds would likely satisfy this 
minimum diversification requirement. 
 Each core investment alternativ e is sufficiently diversified. F or example, if a core investment 
alternative was a mutual fund th at invested in bonds, the fund would need to invest in a variety of 
bonds with various maturities. 
 Plan participants can transfer from or among the investment alt ernatives at least once every 3 
months. 
 Participants can transfer from  or among the investment alternat ives with a frequency that is 
appropriate to each fund’s risk level. 
 Participants receive sufficient in formation to make informed de cisions about the plan’s 
investment options. 
Limitations of 404(c) Protections for Fiduciaries  
However, simply providing employ ees with options that satisfy 4 04(c) requirements does not safeguard a 
fiduciary against lawsuits for selecting funds imprudently, fai ling to monitor them for continuing 
appropriateness, selecting funds  with excessive fees, or engagi ng in a prohibited transaction. 
Moreover, when losses are attribut able to the poor selection of  the investment, 404(c) offers no protection 
because the trustee and other fiduciaries are required to make prudent decisions regarding their selection 
of investment options. That selection is generally linked to th e selection of the mutual fund or group 
annuity provider. 
Finally, fiduciaries are not relie ved of other fiduciary obliga tions even if they comply with all of ERISA 
404(c). For example, fiduciaries must continue to (1) prudently  select the investment alternatives that are 
available to participants, (2) m onitor the investment performan ce of these selections, and (3) prudently 
carry out the participant’s investment instructions. 
ERISA Section 510 
The purpose of Section 510 is to prevent employers from (1) tak ing actions that might abridge or impair 
an employee from collecting bene fits or (2) taking punitive act ion against an employee-participant for 
exercising his or her rights under an employee benefit plan. Ac cordingly, employees may pursue claims 
under Section 510 suits alleging te rmination and other similar adverse employment decisions that threaten 
the accrual of additional benef its despite considerable, contin uous years of employment (e.g., terminating 
an employee, without cause, a month prior to the date on which the employee would have become vested 
in the company’s pension plan). 
More specifically, Section 510 of ERISA prohibits employers fro m (1) discriminating or taking adverse 
action against plan participants o r beneficiaries for exercisin g their rights under ERISA plans, (2) 
interfering with participants’ or  beneficiaries’ attainment of rights under ERISA , and (3) retaliating 
against individuals for giving information or testifying in any  inquiry or proceeding under ERISA. 
But Employers Can Change the Terms of Benefit Plans to Some Extent   
However, it should be recognized t hat while ERISA prohibits emp loyers from taking adverse actions 
against employees exclusively to avoid paying them benefits, em ployers do have the right to reduce or  
12 eliminate nonvested benefits by changing the terms of a plan in  a way that does not discriminate against 
any subgroup. In enacting ERISA , it was Congress’s intent to pr ohibit discrimination in administering a 
welfare benefit plan but still a llow employers to change the te rms of those plans as the need to do so 
arises. 
Fiduciaries versus Settlors: A Di stinction with a Difference 
Fiduciaries and the nature of th eir responsibilities are one of  the key areas addressed by ERISA. In 
addition, a number of related— but different—functions, which ar e also associated with employee benefits 
plans, are carried out by what  are known as settlors. Unlike it  does with fiduciaries, ERISA imposes no 
responsibilities, obligations, or duties on settlors. Neverthel ess, it is important to examine the nature of 
the term “settlor,” to explain their functions, and to distingu ish between settlors and fiduciaries.  
Origin of the Term “Settlor” 
The term “settlor” was derived from the law of trusts. A settlo r is one who operates on a purely 
discretionary basis. In contrast , a fiduciary functions accordi ng to a set of predetermined rules and 
guidelines. 
An Example   
A rich uncle who establishes a trust for his niece (which will pay her $1,000 per month for 25 years) is 
acting in a settlor capacity. Because the uncle does not legall y owe his niece anything, the act of setting 
up the trust is a purely discretionary act. 
On the other hand, if the uncle contracts with a banker to carr y out the terms of the trust (i.e., send the 
niece a check for $1,000 a month for 25 years), the banker will  be acting in a fiduciary capacity. This is 
because the banker will not have the discretion to alter the te rms of the trust that the uncle has established. 
Rather, the banker must act str ictly within the guidelines of t he trust arrangement that were set forth by 
the uncle and is there fore a fiduciary. 
Settlors, Fiduciaries, a nd Employee Benefit Plans 
Using the analogy of a trust, an employer that (1) establishes a benefit plan (governed by ERISA) or (2) 
changes the amount of the benef its payable by the plan is actin g like the uncle (above) who set up a 
discretionary trust and is therefore considered a settlor when it performs either of these functions. Because 
the employer is not required to offer a benefits program to his  or her employees, whether or not the 
employer decides to offer such a  plan is a business decision th at lies within the employer's discretion, just 
like the benefactor setting up the discretionary trust for his niece. However, once the plan is established, 
the employer has a fiduciary duty to carry out the benefit plan  according to the terms set forth in the 
documents that govern that plan. 
An Example   
Assume a company establishes a pe nsion plan that included a spe cific formula (based on its employees’ 
age, years of service with the o rganization, and earnings durin g the employees’ last 5 years) for 
determining the monthly benefit amount payable. According to th at formula, the company owed a retired 
employee $2,000 per month for the rest of his or her life. If t he company fails to pay the $2,000 amount to 
the employee each month, it has breached its duty as a fiduciar y. 
On the other hand, assume a company establish es a 401(k) savings plan under which the company 
matches 50 percent of the employees’ contributions to th e plan, up to 6 percent of their annual salary. If 
the company suffers financial reversals and as a result d ecides to discontinue the company’s matching 
contribution, this decision would be the act of a settlor.  
13 Nevertheless, in this situation, a plaintiff c ould still argue that discontinuing the company match 
constituted a breach of fiduciary duty rather than the act of a settlor. This is because one could still assert 
that the fiduciaries should have done a better job of assessing its financial strength, prior to setting up a 
401(k) plan that committed the organization to a co mpany match, even if that commitment was legally 
revocable as the act of a settlor.   
Employee Benefits Plan Administration Re quires Both Settlor and Fiduciary Acts 
The essential, albeit confusing, p oint is that just because an employer is a fiduciary with respect to an 
employee benefits plan does not mean that all employer acts in conjunction with that plan are subject to a 
fiduciary duty. Importantly, w hen acting as a settlor (i.e., ma king a decision to offer a pension plan, in the 
above example), the employer has no fiduciary obligations. Yet,  when the employer is making periodic 
pension plan payments to employee-beneficiaries under the writt en terms of the pension plan, the 
employer is acting as a fiduciary. Thus, when an employer acts in conjunction with an employee benefit 
plan, some of the employer’s acts will be those of a fiduciary (i.e., making required, periodic payments), 
whereas other acts (i.e., making the decision to establish a pe nsion plan) will be those of a settlor. 
Every fiduciary liability policy form covers insureds for liabi lity they incur when they act as a fiduciary. 
However, some, but by no means a ll, such policies cover insured s for the liability they incur when they 
act as a settlor. In Chapter 7, c overage for settlor functions is discussed in detail.

18 Chapter 2 
Types of Plans Covered and Exempted by ERISA 
Overview 
Chapter 2 analyzes the two major types of plans to which the Em ployee Retirement Income Security Act 
(ERISA) of 1974 law applies: employee pension benefit plans and  employee welfare benefit plans. In 
addition, this chapter notes the basic requirements included wi thin the ERISA law to which these plans 
must adhere. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 distinguish between employee benefit pension plans and employee  welfare benefit plans, 
 identify the basic requirements of ERISA plans, and 
 recognize the effects of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act (COBRA) of 1985 and 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  of 1996. 
Types of Covered Benefit Plans 
ERISA covers two types of employee benefit plans: (1) employee pension benefit plans and (2) employee 
welfare benefit plans. There a re also plans not subject to ERIS A. 
Employee Pension Benefit Plans 
These are plans created by an emp loyer, a union, or both and th at provide for retirement income or the 
deferral of income (e.g., 401(k) p lans and “traditional” define d benefit pension plan s, both of which will 
be discussed later in this course). 
Under ERISA, pension plans must p rovide for vesting of employee s’ pension benefits after a specified 
minimum number of years. ERISA also requires that the employers  who sponsor plans satisfy certain 
minimum funding requirements. 
In addition, ERISA regulates the manner in which a pension plan  may pay benefits. For example, a 
defined benefit plan must pay a married participant’s pension a s a “joint-and-survivor annuity” that 
provides continuing benefits to  the surviving spouse unless bot h the participant and the spouse waive the 
survivor coverage. 
ERISA established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBG C) to provide coverage in the event 
that a terminated defined benef it pension plan does not have su fficient assets to provide the benefits 
earned by participants. The PBGC will be discussed in more deta il later in this chapter. 
Employee Welfare Benefit Plans 
These are plans, funds, or programs created by an employer or u nion for the purpose of providing 
medical, sickness, accident, disability, death, unemployment, a nd vacation benefits, apprenticeships,  
19 training programs, day care centers, scholarship funds, prepaid  legal services, or any benefit allowed by 
the Taft-Hartley Act. 
Again, it is important to stress that ERISA does not require th at an employer provide health insurance 
coverage (or any of the aforementioned types of benefit program s) to its employees or retirees, but it 
regulates the operation of a health benefit plan if an employer  chooses to establish one. 
Plans Not Subject to ERISA 
In contrast to employee pension benefit plans and employee welf are benefit plans, other types of 
programs are exempt from the law. Exhibit 2.1 enumerates both t ypes. 
Exhibit 2.1 
ERISA and Non-ERISA Plans 
Plans Subject to ERISA  
 Pension plans 
 Profit-sharing plans 
 Thrift and savings (401(k)) 
 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) 
 Tax Reform Act Stock Ow nership Plan (TRASOP) 
 Welfare plans 
 Life insurance 
 Hospital/surgical/medical insurance 
 Dental and vision care insurance 
 Accident insurance 
 Disability income 
 Scholarship plans (which are funded) 
 Supplemental unemployment 
 Prepaid legal services 
 Some severance pay plans 
Plans Not Subject to ERISA  
 Plans falling under other, more specific laws (e.g., workers c ompensation, unemployment 
compensation, disab ility insurance) 
 Plans maintained outside the United States, primarily for nonr esident aliens 
 Unfunded plans maintained solely to provide benefits for certa in employees in excess of 
the limitations imposed on benefit s and contributions for tax p urposes (Section 415, 
Internal Revenue Code) 
 Plans of federal and state gov ernments and political subdivisi ons, agencies, and 
instrumentalities

In addition to the types of plans  that are both subject to and exempt from the law, ERISA has established 
the basic requirements to which subject plans must comply. Thes e are enumerated in Exhibit 2.2. 
Exhibit 2.2 
Requirements for Plans Subject to ERISA  
Plans subject to ERISA must:  
 Be maintained pursuant to a written instrument 
 Provide for named fiduciaries 
 Provide a procedure for est ablishing and fulfilling a funding policy 
 Describe responsible parties for: 
o Operation 
o Administration 
o Fiduciary duties 
 Provide a procedure for and i dentify the parties who can amend  the plan 
 Describe the basis for payments made to and from the plan

Two Key Amendments to ERISA 
ERISA was later expanded to inclu de two major health laws. Spec ifically, the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 and the Health Insura nce Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) of 1996 amended ERIS A to make healthcare coverage m ore portable and secure for 
employees. 
Continuation of Heal th Coverage (COBRA) 
COBRA gives workers and their fa milies who lose their health be nefits the right to choose to continue 
group health benefits. COBRA requires that group health plans s ponsored by employers with 20 or more 
employees (in the prior year) offer employees and their familie s the opportunity to purchase a temporary 
extension of health coverage (ca lled continuation coverage) in certain instances whe re coverage under the 
plan would otherwise end. 
Such coverage is continued for a limited period of time (i.e., 18 months) under certain “qualifying events” 
such as voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the num ber of hours worked, transition between 
jobs, death, divorce, and other life events. Qualified individu als—rather than the employer—are required 
to pay the entire premium for coverage, plus up to a 2 percent administrative charge. 
On the other hand, COBRA does not apply if employees lose their  benefits coverage because the 
employer has terminated the plan altogether or if the employer has gone out of business. 
COBRA outlines how employees and family members may elect conti nuation of coverage. It also 
requires employers and plans to provide notice of the option fo r continuation of coverage. 
Portability of Health Coverage (HIPAA) 
HIPAA affords rights and protec tions for participants and benef iciaries in group health plans. HIPAA 
includes (1) protections for cove rage under group health plans that would otherwise limit or exclude  
21 coverage for preexisting conditi ons, (2) prohibitions of discri mination against employees and dependents 
based on their health status, a nd (3) allowance for a special o pportunity to enroll in a new plan, to 
individuals, under certain circumstances. 
Retiree Healthcare Benefits: Not Subject to ERISA Protections 
During the 1990s and 2000s, a num ber of employers who promised lifetime healthcare coverage to their 
retired workers discontinued su ch programs or substantially red uced the scope of benefits paid under 
them. However, ERISA does not ma ndate the vesting of retiree he althcare benefits in the manner that it 
requires employees to become vested  in pension plans. Neverthel ess, employees and retirees who had 
been promised lifetime health coverage by their employers may s till be able to enforce these promises by 
suing on a breach of contract the ory or by challenging the righ t of the health benefit plan to change its 
plan documents in order to e liminate promised benefits. 
The ERISA Preemption for Healthcare Plans 
As noted above, ERISA governs plans providing healthcare benefi ts. However, in claims involving 
administration of an ERISA-qualified healthcare benefit plan, E RISA contains a provision that 
preempts—meaning that it has a hi gher priority than—similar sta te laws, even if those state laws took 
effect after ERISA. 
As a result of the ERISA preemp tion provision, the Act bars jur y trials (ERISA cases are tried before 
judges) and punitive damage award s. Furthermore, damages are li mited to actual medical expenses 
incurred (i.e., damages for pain  and suffering are not permitte d). 
Also important is the fact that fiduciary liability policies do  not generally cover claims associated with 
employer-provided medical plan s, because fiduciary liability po licy forms routinely contain exclusions 
for bodily injury. 
The Managed Care E xception Coverage 
Nevertheless, the vast majority o f insurers provide coverage fo r claims involving ERISA-qualified 
healthcare plans by adding an ex ception to this exclusion for c overage of bodily inju ry claims associated 
with employer-provided health i nsurance coverage. Most insurers  incorporate this exception by including 
a coverage extension within their  policies that “excepts”—and t herefore covers—bodily  injury, sickness, 
mental or emotional distress, di sease, or death when such event s result from the administration of 
managed healthcare plans. 
The two most common claim scenar ios associated with the managed  care exposures involve an injured 
employee-claimant suing an emplo yer sponsor of a managed health care plan, alleging 
1. that the employer-sponsor of a managed healthcare plan negligen tly selected the managed 
healthcare plan provider and/or 
2. that the employer-sponsor of a ma naged healthcare plan wrongly denied or delayed medical 
benefits provided by the plan. 
Absent managed care coverage wording that “excepts” (and theref ore covers) bodily injury when it arises 
from managed care plan administr ation, coverage would otherwise  be excluded for these scenarios. 
However, this coverage is an im portant aspect of fiduciary liab ility policy forms since such plans are 
subject to ERISA and fiduciaries are exposed to personal liabil ity as a result. This aspect of coverage is 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 of this course.

24 Chapter 3 
Liability Exposures Associated with Employee Pension Benefit Plans 
Overview 
As noted in the previous chapters, the Employee Retirement Inco me Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 
governs two types of employee benefit plans: employee pension b enefit plans and employee welfare 
benefit plans. By far, the lar ger of the two exposures to which  ERISA fiduciaries are subject is in 
conjunction with employee pension benefit plans. 
Chapter 3 discusses the liabilit y claim exposures resulting fro m the three major types of employee 
pension benefit plans: (1) defined benefit plans, (2) defined c ontribution plans, and (3 ) cash balance plans. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 distinguish among defined benef it, defined contribution, and ca sh-balance pension plans; 
 identify the key provisions of the  Pension Protection Act of 20 06; and 
 recognize pension benefit-relate d situations that increase the probability of a fiduciary liability 
claim and select appropriate measures for mitigating the exposu re. 
Types of Employee Pension Benefit Plans 
There are three types of employee pension benefit plans. 
 Defined benefit pension plans. These are retirement plans in whi ch an employer promises to pay  
a specific monthly benefit amount  (or a lump sum) at retirement , based on a predetermined 
formula. For example, based upon an employee’s years of service , age, and salary during the final 
10 years, he or she will receive a specific monthly pension pay ment for life. Such plans are often 
referred to as “traditional” pension plans. 
 Defined contribution pension plans.  These plans provide no guara ntee of a specific benefit 
amount. However, unlike defined be nefit pension plans, under de fined contribution plans, the 
employee has a separate retirement account in which he or she h as an individual ownership 
interest. The most common type of defined contribution plan is a 401(k) plan. Under such plans, 
employees contribute a percentage of their annual salary each y ear to a savings plan, up to a 
specified annual dollar limit (i.e ., $18,000 in 2017, with a $2 4,000 limit for employees 50 years 
of age or older). The employer will usually match one-half of t he employee’s contribution, most 
often up to 6 percent. For example, if an employee contributes 6 percent of his or her salary to the 
401(k) plan, the employer will c ontribute an additional 3 perce nt, so that the employee will have 
saved a total of 9 percent of his or her annual salary (i.e., 6  percent contribution, plus 3 percent 
employer match). According to a report by the American Benefits  Council ( 401(k) fast facts ), as 
of June 2013, there were 638,390 defined contribution plans, wi th 73,668,000 participants, 
holding $3.8 trillion in assets.  
25  Cash balance pension plans.  These plans are a “hybrid” of defined benefit and defined 
contribution plans. Under such plans, the employer makes contri butions to the pension plan, but 
the accrued benefits are defined in terms of an individual acco unt balance. Legally, however, the 
plans are defined benefit plans, because the employees do not a ctually own the individual 
accounts. Cash balance plans o ffer a guaranteed benefit like a traditional pension but generally 
provide longtime workers with low er accrued benefits, compared to defined benefit pension 
plans. 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
As has been the dominant trend since the early 1980s, the natio n’s employers have been moving away 
from offering defined benefit pe nsion plans. This is especially  true among employers within the private 
sector. According to “Worker Participation in Employer-Sponsore d Pensions: A Fact Sheet,” by John J. 
Topoleski (March 26, 2014), only 19 percent of the private-sect or workforce has access to a defined 
benefit pension plan, whereas 59 percent of the public-sector w orkforce has such access. Moreover, 
83percent of all state and local government workers have access  to a defined benefit pension plan and 32 
percent of such workers have a  defined contribution plan availa ble. 
Assuring Pension Plan Solvency : The Pension Benefit Guaranty Co rporation (PBGC) 
To ensure that pension plans set up by corporations will be abl e to honor their payment obligations to 
employees, the PBGC was established as a part of ERISA. The mis sion of the PBGC, which is an 
independent agency of the federal government, is to (1) preserv e pension plans and protect pensioners, (2) 
pay pension benefits on time a nd accurately, and (3) maintain h igh standards of stewardship and 
accountability. 
The PBGC guarantees payment of t he basic pension benefits earne d by more than 40 million American 
workers and retirees in nearly 24,000 plans. Subject to other s tatutory limitations, PBGC’s insurance 
program pays pension benefits up to the maximum guaranteed bene fit set by law to participants who retire 
at 65 ($60,136 per year, as of 2016). Since 1974, PBGC has prov ided for almost 1.5 million people in 
nearly 4,800 failed single-employer and multiemployer plans. In  fiscal year 2015, the PBGC made benefit 
payments of $5.7 billion to near ly 826,000 retirees from more t han 4,700 failed single-employer pension 
plans. (Source: PBGC, 2015 Annual Report http://pbgc.gov/Docume nts/2015-annual-report.pdf#page=6.) 
Two programs make up the PBGC, one for single-employer pension plans and another for multiemployer 
pension plans. (Multiemployer plans are set up by collectively bargained agreements involving more than 
one unrelated employer, generally in one industry.) 
Funding for the PBGC comes from the following sources. 
 Insurance premiums paid by employers who sponsor defined benefi t pension plans 
 Assets held by the pension pl ans that the PBGC takes over 
 Recoveries of unfunded pensi on liabilities from plan sponsors’ bankruptcy estates 
 Investment income 
   
26 Exposures from Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
Defined benefit pension plans ge nerate several fiduciary liabil ity exposures. These exposures are noted in 
Exhibit 3.1. 
Exhibit 3.1  
Liability Exposures from Defined Benefit Pension Plans  
(1) Lack of actuarial solvency 
(2) Conversion of a defined benef it pension plan to cash balanc e defined benefit 
pension plans 
(3) Mergers/terminations of plans (4) Plan disclosures 
(5) Imprudent investment of assets 
(6) Failure to pursue delinquent contributions 
(7) Negligence not involving discretionary activities 
(8) Claims from fraudulent schemes 
Lack of Actuarial Solvency 
The major exposure to which defined benefit pension plans are s usceptible is a lack of actuarial solvency. 
(Actuarial solvency is a situa tion in which, based on certain k ey assumptions, such as the expected rate of 
return on pension plan assets and the mortality experience of t he pension plan’s beneficiaries, that a 
pension plan will have sufficien t funds with which to pay all b enefits that are promised by the plan.) As 
noted, such plans promise to pay employee-beneficiaries a speci fic amount of money from the time they 
retire until the end of their lives (or, in the case of employe es who elect a joint survivor annuity, to pay a 
beneficiary). This amount is usually based on a formula that fa ctors in (1) years of service, (2) age at 
retirement, and (3) earnings during the last 5 to 10 years of e mployment. 
The ability to pay such benefits  is based on a number of actuar ial assumptions, the most important of 
which are employee mortality and expected rate of return on emp loyer contributions to the pension fund. 
If, however, such assumptions prove  to be incorrect, a defined benefit pension fund may be unable to pay 
promised benefits to its benefic iaries. Therefore, the solvency  risk is the single-largest exposure faced by 
defined benefit pension plans. 
The wrongful acts producing such claims are usually committed b y those responsible for administering an 
insured firm’s benefit plan. For example, a common claim scenar io is one in which a defined benefit 
pension fund is unable to pay p romised benefits because it had been seriously underfunded for a long 
period of time and/or because its actual rate of return on fund s is much lower than the rate that was 
anticipated when the original p lan was devised. Beneficiaries t hen sue the company’s employee benefits 
manager and/or those responsible  for administering the pension plan, alleging that the administrators were 
negligent in funding the plan. 
Conversions from Defined Benefit  Pension Plans to Cash Balance Pension Plans 
A number of large employers have restructured their defined ben efit pension plans to cash balance plans, 
which has produced a number of cla ims. Before analyzing the nat ure of such claims, the essential features 
of cash balance and defined benefit plans will be discussed and  compared. 
Cash Balance Pension Plans versus Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
A cash balance plan makes two pro mises to employees. First, it promises that an employer will contribute 
to the plan an amount equal to a  percentage of each year of the  employee’s earnings. Second, it promises  
27 a specific rate of return on th at contribution. Under a cash ba lance plan, the benefit is always expressed as 
a total account balance held by an individual employee. 
This is in contrast to a defined benefit pension plan, which pr omises an employee a flat dollar payout 
(either on a periodic, usually monthly, or on a lump-sum, basis ), based on (1) years of service, (2) age at 
retirement, and (3) an employee’ s earnings in the years closest  to retirement. On the other hand, 
distributions from cash balance pl ans are usually offered in th e form of a lump-sum payment, although 
these plans are legally required to offer an annuity option. 
Cash balance plans build value s teadily and often at the same p ace for all employees, regardless of their 
length of service. The focus of these plans is on wealth buildi ng and portability. Conversely, defined 
benefit plans are aimed at encour aging career employment with a  single employer. Instead of focusing on 
wealth, their aim is to provide retirement security. The design  of these plans does not reward employees 
who change jobs. 
Why Employers Like Cash Balance Plans 
Cash balance plans appeal to em ployers because they (1) allow t hem to more easily determine their 
liability for future payments to  employees, (2) help to attract  and retain workers in a more mobile 
employment environment in which  people frequently change jobs, and (3) avoid the difficulties involved 
in explaining defined benefit plan s and their often-complex for mulas. 
Why Claims Arise in Conjunction with Cash Balance Conversions 
The key “driver” of claims fro m cash balance conversions is the  assertion that younger employees 
typically fare better than they would under the original define d benefit plan that is being phased out. This 
is because the accrual pattern unde r a cash balance plan provid es them with a larger benefit if they leave 
their current employer. On the other hand, older workers with m ore years of service may not do as well. 
In response to these conversions, in which older employees woul d experience significant reductions in 
their benefit levels, lawsuits have been filed against employer s with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission alleging illegal reduction of benefits. 
Restrictions on Plan Changes 
ERISA places restrictions on pens ion plan changes, including am endments that convert a defined benefit 
pension plan formula to a cash balance plan. Such restrictions require that the following. 
 Advance notification is required if, as a result of the amendme nt, the rate at which plan 
participants may earn benefits  in the future is significantly r educed. 
 Other legal requirements must be satisfied, including prohibiti ons against age discrimination. In 
addition, there are prohibitions of discrimination against lowe r-income and nonmanagerial 
workers. 
 Employers who amend their plans to reduce the rate at which fut ure benefits are earned are 
prohibited from reducing the bene fits that participants have al ready earned. In other words, an 
employee may not receive less than his or her accrued benefit u nder the plan formula at the 
effective date of the amendment. 
A Notable Claim Involving Conver sion to a Cash Balance Plan 
One significant claim involving conversion of a defined benefit  pension plan to a cash balance plan was 
brought against IBM in December 1999 by a group of employee ben eficiaries of IBM’s pension plans. 
The employees contended that var ious changes IBM made to these plans violated ERISA’s 
antidiscrimination provisions, particularly with respect to old er workers. This is because cash balance 
plans build value more quickly in the early years of a worker’s  tenure with a company than do defined  
28 benefit plans. In contrast, during the latter years of an indiv idual’s tenure with an organization, the value 
of a defined benefit plan grows more rapidly. Thus, older worke rs with longer tenures can make the 
argument that conversions from de fined benefit plans to cash ba lance plans discriminate against them. 
Ultimately, however, US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  ruled that IBM’s conversion of its 
defined benefit pension plan did  not discriminate against such workers. 
Mergers/Termination of Plans 
Claims are frequently made when c ompanies merge and pension or benefit plans are terminated in the 
process. For example, Firm A is acquired by Firm B. Firm A’s pe nsion plan is then merged into Firm B’s, 
with a subsequent reduction in e xpected pension benefits for th e employees of Firm A, the acquired 
company. At the time of the ac quisition, however, the managers of the plan fail to communicate these 
benefit reductions to the affect ed workers. Ten years later, wh en the workers are eligible to receive their 
pension benefits and they are not as large as expected, the wor kers sue the fiduciaries for failing to 
communicate these changes. 
Plan Disclosures 
Claims often result because of th e way in which benefit plan ch anges are communicated to workers. Here 
is a typical claim scenario. Company A asserts that it has no p lans to improve the benefits available under 
its current defined benefit pension plan. Then, the company pro vides an early retirement offer to its 
workers, and some, but not all, of these workers accept the off er. Shortly thereafter, Company A is 
acquired by Company B, which provi des enhanced retirement benef its compared to those of Company A. 
Those who accepted the early retir ement offer sue Company A, al leging that Company A knew it would 
soon be acquired by Company B a nd therefore sought to reduce it s pension liabilities by making early 
retirement offers to its workers. 
Imprudent Investment of Assets 
Claims alleging imprudent investment of assets frequently invol ve situations where a  high percentage 
(e.g., 20 percent or more) of a de fined benefit pension fund’s assets are invested in a single company’s 
common stock. For example, assume that the company in whose sto ck the pension plan is invested then 
begins to experience financial difficulties and eventually file s for bankruptcy protection. The total value 
of the pension plan drops significantly when the stock is rende red nearly worthless. As a result of the 
plan’s imprudent investment of such a high percentage of its as sets in a single stock, the beneficiaries of 
the plan make a claim against the pension fiduciaries. 
Failure To Pursue Delinquent Contributions 
Such claims most often arise when  a multiemployer pension fund (typically found in unionized, 
manufacturing industries) becomes insolvent because the pension  trustee had been lax in obtaining 
periodic employer contributions from one of the major participa nts in the fund. Frequently, such 
contributions are delinquent becau se one or more of the partici pating firms is experiencing financial 
difficulties. 
Negligence Not Involving Di scretionary Activities 
Claims within this category typically involve losses arising fr om administrative errors. For example, a 
company’s employee benefits administrator inadvertently forgets  to enroll a new employee in the 
company’s pension program. When the employee retires and learns  that he or she is not covered by the 
pension plan, he or she sues the administrator.  
29 Claims from Fraudulent Schemes 
In December 2008, it was revealed  that Bernard Madoff had been operating an investment company for 
more than a decade that, in reality, was nothing more than a ma ssive Ponzi scheme. Early investors in the 
company were “paid back” with m onies provided by recent investo rs as a means of hiding the company’s 
losses. A number of prominent, union-sponsored pension funds we re “invested” in the scheme. A pension 
fund covering about 800 police, fir efighters, and other employe es in the Connecticut town of Fairfield had 
about $40 million managed by Mr. Madoff, according to Fairfield ’s First Selectman Kenneth Flatto. In 
addition, the $40 billion state pension fund of Massachusetts f aced losses of up to $12 million after it 
invested the money with Austin C apital Management, a Texas-base d fund of hedge funds,2 which placed 
the money with Mr. Madoff.3 
Exposures from Defined Contribution Plans 
There are a number of liability exposures faced by fiduciaries from the administration of defined 
contribution plans. Several of these exposures are listed in Ex hibit 3.2. 
Exhibit 3.2  
Liability Exposures from Defined Contribution Plans  
(1) Concentration of assets in c ompany stock (i.e., stock in th e company sponsoring the 
plan), 
(2) Blackout periods, 
(3) Restrictions on selling matc hing company stock contribution s, 
(4) Lack of guidance regardi ng investment strategies, 
(5) Failure to follow the invest ment request of a plan particip ant, and 
(6) Allegations of excessive defined benefit plan fees. 
Concentration of Employer Stock in 401(k) Plans 
Fiduciaries at firms with high concentrations of 401(k) assets invested in their own organization’s 
common stock face a significant exposure to liability claims. W hen the value of such stock experiences a 
precipitous decrease in value, fiduciaries are at risk. Under t hese circumstances, 401(k) plan participants 
are likely to allege that inten tional, improper internal accoun ting practices artificially inflated the 
company’s earnings, which drove a temporary rise in, but eventu ally caused a large drop in, the 
company’s share price. Fiduciary liability in this situation ar ises from fiduciaries’ awareness of these 
questionable accounting practices and yet allowing such acts to  continue but without making any formal 
objections to senior management. 
This was precisely what is clai med to have occurred at Enron Co rporation, where employee plaintiffs 
alleged that plan fiduciaries we re aware of such accounting pra ctices, they misrepresented to plan 
participants the value and safet y of Enron’s stock, and the fid uciaries encouraged investment in the stock 
to support an artificially high price for the stock. 
In December 2001, when Enron filed for bankruptcy protection, i ts stock price plummeted to less than $1 
per share. Since its employee 401(k) plan holders maintained ap proximately 60 percent of their total 
401(k) funds in Enron Corporation stock (as reported in USA Today , January 21, 2002, “The Enron 
Scandal by the Numbers,” the employees suffered severe losses. 
In contrast to the fiduciary behavior in the Enron situation, f iduciaries of a defined contribution plan have 
a duty to tell the truth about th e company’s stock, encourage d iversification of investments within the 
401(k) plan, and make participants aware of the need to invest in other vehicles. In the absence of such 
actions, they face considerable potential liability. (Note: cur rently, there are no laws that restrict 
employees from investing more than a certain percentage of thei r 401(k) contributions in company stock.)  
30 Company Stock in 401(k) Plans: Key Data 
Despite Enron’s bitter experience , according to a 2013 study by  Morningstar Investments, “Employer 
Stock Ownership in 401(k) Plans and Subsequent Company Stock Pe rformance,” the concentration of 
company stock in 401(k) plans remains high. In fact, the follow ing notable companies had more than 50 
percent  of total plan assets invested i n company stock: Exxon, McDonal d’s, and Lowe’s Corp.! 
Why and How Companies Encourage Company  Stock Ownership in 401(k) Plans 
Companies that promote the owner ship of company stock in 401(k)  plans believe that encouraging 
employees to own stock creates an  “ownership culture” in which employees will be even more committed 
to the firm’s success. These companies often match employee con tributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis 
when these monies are used to buy  company stock. This compares to the typical 401(k) plan that matches 
only 50 percent of an employee’s contributions and only up to 6  percent of the amount contributed. 
For example, assume an employ ee’s annual salary is $50,000, he or she contributes 6 percent of his or her 
salary, and the employer will match 50 percent of the employee’ s 6 percent contribution. In this instance, 
the employee contributes $3,000 (i.e., 6 percent of $50,000), a nd the employer adds $1,500 (i.e., 3 percent 
of $50,000), for a total of $4,500. If the employee were to con tribute a higher percentage of his or her 
salary, say 10 percent, the employer would not make any additio nal contribution. So in this case, if the 
employee put in 10 percent, or $5,000, and the employer contrib uted $1,500, this would total $6,500. 
In contrast, under some 401(k) pro grams in which employees use their contributions to buy company 
stock (and using the numbers in  the previous paragraph), employ ers will match the employee’s 
contribution on a dollar-for-dolla r basis, up to as much as 10 percent. Thus, if the employee were to 
contribute 10 percent of his or her salary for company stock (i .e., $5,000), the employer would match this 
amount with an additional $5,000 , for a total contribution of $ 10,000, compared to just $6,500 in the 
example above. Obviously, programs of this nature encourage hea vy investment in company stock by 
401(k) plan participants. 
RadioShack: A Case Study in the Dangers of  Offering Company Sto ck as a 401(k) Plan 
Option 
On February 5, 2015—a date on wh ich the company’s stock was sel ling for roughly 13 cents per share—
RadioShack declared bankruptcy. U nfortunately for many of the c ompany’s employees, RadioShack 
offered company stock as one of the investment options in its 4 01(k) plan. 
As reported in the Dallas Morning News  (“Employees bet their future  on RadioShack shares,” by 
Mitchell Schnurman, February 3, 2015), “... six months ago, abo ut 2,600 employees had over 3.5 million 
shares in the 401(k).” On average, each 401(k) plan participant  held 1,346 shares in his or her 401(k) 
account in 2014, which was 500 more shares than in 2007, the ar ticle reported. However, the average 
value of RadioShack shares in  each employee account, worth appr oximately $27,000 per person in 2007, 
had plummeted to just $1,300 during the summer of 2014, Mr. Sch nurman stated. 
The article noted that three class action lawsuits were filed a gainst the fiduciaries of RadioShack’s 401(k) 
plan in November and December 2014. The suits alleged that exec utives breached their fiduciary duties 
by failing to take protective actions, such as ending RadioShac k stock purchases and selling existing 
shares in the plans, steps that w ould have reduced employee los ses, the article reported. In December 
2014, the Department of Labor began an investigation to determi ne if the company acted in compliance 
with laws governing retirement plans, Mr. Schnurman pointed out . 
   
31 The case underscores the perils c onfronting both fiduciaries an d employees when company stock is a 
401(k) plan option. For each group , two distinct sets of risks are created if the company suffers severe 
financial reversals.  
 Fiduciaries . First, nonemployee shareholders are likely to bring “traditio nal” securities class 
action claims, charging that gross mismanagement of the company  caused its stock price to fall. 
Second, employees who hold compa ny shares in their 401(k) accou nts will also bring claims 
against fiduciaries, asserting that the fiduciaries violated th eir duties under ERISA to act 
prudently and for the benefit of t heir plan beneficiaries. The losses sustained from this exposure 
are often referred to as “ERISA stock drop” claims. 
 Employees.  Employees who hold shares of their employer’s company in their  401(k) account run 
the risk of losing money in the event the company’s earnings fa ll and its share price follows suit. 
In addition, when the company declares bankruptcy (as in the ca se of RadioShack), the 
employees are also at risk of losing their jobs. 
Vivien v. WorldCom: A Legal Theory To Recover Losses in Company Stock 
The case of Vivien v. WorldCom,  No. 02-01329 WHA (N.D. Cal. July . 26, 2002), established a leg al 
theory that permitted workers to recover losses in their 401(k)  retirement plans that contained investments 
in their employers’ stock. In this case, the employee plaintiff s alleged that since ERISA imposes a duty on 
fiduciaries (1) to provide accura te information to employee ben efit plan participants and (2) to invest plan 
monies prudently, a breach of these duties establishes liabilit y for losses sustained. 
The basis of the suit by 401(k) employee plan holders was that WorldCom’s retirement plan 
administrators were “company insiders.” As such, they were well  aware that the company’s share price 
was highly inflated because the administrators knew about the m aterial misstatements contained within its 
periodic financial filings to th e Securities and Exchange Commi ssion. When the public eventually learned 
the true nature of the company’s financial condition, WorldCom’ s stock price collapsed, and 401(k) plan 
holders saw the value of their accounts plummet. In this regard , the fiduciaries breached their duty to 
provide accurate information about plan investments. 
Plaintiff-employees also alleged that under ERISA, WorldCom had  a fiduciary duty to invest plan assets 
in a prudent manner. The lawsu it charged a breach of this duty because administrators continued to invest 
plan assets in WorldCom stock d espite their awareness of how th e company’s share price in no way 
reflected WorldCom’s actual value. Thus, given the administrato rs’ failure to provide accurate 
information about plan investme nts, coupled with their failure to invest plan funds prudently in light of 
their knowledge concerning such investments, the court ruled in  favor of the plaintiffs. The Vivien  
decision provided the legal framework for many similar suits fi led by employees of companies such as 
AOL Time Warner, Reliant Energy , Tyco International, and others . As a result of these claims, many 
major companies restructured their 401(k) plans by eliminating previous requirements that plan 
participants own certain amounts of company stock. 
The Blackout Exposure 
Another exposure created by 401( k) plans is one that exists whe n plan participants are not permitted to 
change their investments during a specific period of time typic ally lasting from 4 to 6 weeks. This most 
often occurs when a 401(k) plan changes administrators. In the Enron situation referred to above, a 
blackout exposure resulted when t he company changed 401(k) plan  administrators. Lawyers for Enron’s 
employee-plaintiffs claimed tha t Enron breached its fiduciary d uty to workers when it mandated a 
“freeze” or “blackout” that prevented employees from selling th eir shares of Enron stock during this 
period. Workers alleged that the y were unable to access their a ccounts from October 21 to November 19, 
a period in which Enron’s stock price fell from $26.05 to $9.25 .  
32 Regardless of the length of the  blackout period in the Enron si tuation, the fiduciaries of any firm 
sponsoring a 401(k) plan face an exposure to claims under these  conditions. Not only does a freeze on the 
selling of company shares create an exposure when the overall s tock market is declining rapidly, but such 
an exposure is exacerbated when a  high concentration of 401(k) plan assets are invested in a single 
stock—namely, the company’s. This is because a single company’s  stock is much more prone to drop 
significantly during the time in which there is a change of adm inistrators, compared to the likely drop in 
the overall stock market (as represented by Standard & Poor’s i ndex of 500 stocks), during a comparable 
period of time. 
Restrictions on Selling Matchi ng Company Stock Contributions 
As already noted, depending on the individual plan, the employe r typically matches an employee’s 
contributions to some extent. M ost often, a company will match 50 percent of each dollar contributed by 
the employee, up to 6 percent of  the employee’s salary. However , under some 401(k) plans, the company 
will match the employee’s cont ribution on a dollar-for-dollar b asis and up to 10 percent of the employee’s 
salary. 
Usually, 10 percent matches are only available in the form of c ompany stock. Moreover, in most such 
companies, and as was the case with Enron, matching company sto ck cannot be sold by a worker until a 
certain age, typically 50 (in En ron’s case) or even 55. Yet, wh en employees are locked into the matching 
contributions of company stock un til age 50 or 55, the fiduciar ies of such companies are exposed to 
additional liability. This is b ecause the company’s employees m ay be unable to sell their company stock 
in a weak overall stock market o r when financial reversals with in the organization itself contribute to a 
rapidly declining price for the company’s stock. 
Lack of Guidance Regarding  Investment Strategies 
Under ERISA, fiduciaries can f ace liability for an employee par ticipant’s losses within a 401(k) plan 
when fiduciaries provide inaccurate advice regarding investment  strategies and personal financial 
planning. 
Hiring Outside Advisers 
A number of organizations attemp t to mitigate this exposure by hiring outside financial experts and 
counselors to personally assist employees with their investment  choices. However, even this approach 
does not completely absolve employer-fiduciaries from liability , because fiduciaries can still be held 
responsible if they negligently selected such advisers. Given t his situation, a number of firms simply do 
not provide employees with any investment assistance, which oft en leads to allegations that they failed to 
exercise their fiduciary duties. 
Failure To Follow the Request of a Plan Participant ( LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & 
Assocs., Inc. ) 
The US Supreme Court’s ruling in LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Assocs., Inc., 128 S. Ct. 1020 
(2008), is significant because it is likely to result in an inc rease in the number of claims alleging that 
corporate fiduciaries committed errors in managing individual 4 01(k) accounts. 
The general rule that emerged from this case is that employees can now sue fiduciaries not only for acts 
that cause harm to an overall  401(k) plan but also for damage to individual  401(k) accounts. 
James LaRue sued his former empl oyer for failure to transfer as sets in his 401(k) account to less risky 
investments as Mr. LaRue had instructed. He asserted that such failure caused him to lose $150,000. The 
key point of contention in this case was the question of whethe r Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA permitted 
claims to be brought for losses incurred by individual  benefit plan participants like Mr. LaRue or whether 
such claims were limited onl y to losses sustained by the entire  plan.  
33 In a unanimous 9–0 ruling, the c ourt reversed its earlier holdi ng in the 1985 case of Massachusetts Life 
Ins. Co. v. Russell , 473 U.S. 134 (1985). In that case, the court barred suits by individuals, instead only 
allowing claims when a fiduciary’s error caused an entire plan to sustain losses. But in LaRue , the court 
overturned its earlier finding, this time concluding that Mr. L aRue could sue for dama ges suffered to his 
individual account. 
It is important to recognize, however, that with its decision, the US Supreme Court did not find the 
fiduciary liable to the plainti ff, Mr. LaRue. Rather, the court ’s ruling only meant that the plaintiff had the 
right to prove that the fiduciary’s negligence caused his loss,  an issue that had to be re-litigated in a trial 
court. Prior to the US Supreme Court’s ruling, the plaintiff wo uld have been barred from even attempting 
to prove the fiduciary’s neglig ence, since fiduciaries could on ly have been held liab le for losses incurred 
by an entire plan, rather than t hose incurred by an individual (which was what happened here). 
The court’s conclusion reflects the changing reality of pension  plans since the days of the Massachusetts 
Life decision. At that time, defined  benefit pension plans were sti ll the norm, whereas today, defined 
contribution pension plans (i.e., 401(k) plans) are by far the predominant retirement vehicle offered to 
employees. Since defined benefit pension plans are quickly disa ppearing, while defined 
contribution/401(k) plans are now  the norm, the court’s ruling recognizes the reality that a fiduciary’s 
error can indeed cause damage to an individual’s 401(k) account , without doing likewise to the assets of 
an entire 401(k) plan. In other words, what was a significant l oss for Mr. LaRue may have only 
represented a relatively small pe rcentage of the entire plan’s assets. 
Claims Alleging Excessive Fees 
Increasingly, lawsuits are charging that the sponsors of define d contribution plans have allowed plan 
administrators and other plan service providers to charge exces sive fees, which constitutes a breach of 
duty under ERISA. 
In addition to these allegations, l awsuits have also asserted t hat service providers levy excessive fees on 
defined contribution plans so that the sponsoring corporation c an obtain other services more cheaply. For 
example, an investment managemen t firm may charge an unusually high fee to manage 401(k) plan assets 
in return for charging a lower-than-average fee for a line of c redit to the sponsoring company. This too 
constitutes a breach of fiduciary  duty under ERISA, because the  sponsor is profiting at the expense of the 
beneficiaries of its defined contribution plan. 
Over a long period of time, a small difference in the fee that is charged by the manager of a mutual fund 
within a 401(k) plan can make a substantial difference in a pla n holder’s balance. This effect is illustrated 
in Exhibit 3.3. 
   
34 Exhibit 3.3  
Small Fee Differences Can Produce Large Differences in 401(k) B alances  
An employee making a salary of $70,000 contributes 6 percent of  his or her ea rnings to a 
401(k) plan for 40 years and al so receives a 50 percent annual company match. Assume 
that his or her salary increas es 3 percent annually. Also assum e that his or her portfolio 
grows at a 5 percent rate, inc luding the charge for annual fees . The employee’s balance is 
$1,304,253 at the end o f the 40 years. But, i f the annual fees were increased just 1 percent, 
making the overall growth rate 4 percent, the employee’s balanc e is reduced to 
$1,051,054—a $253,199 difference. W hile the discrepancy is not as pronounced in the 
earlier years of an employee’s career, the more than quarter-mi llion-dollar difference at the 
end of an employee’s career i s obviously substantial. 
 
401(k) Balance over Time 
Differences of this magni tude, while significant for an individ ual employee, can explode to 
astronomical proportions when a class action lawsuit by, for ex ample, 5,000 employees 
asserts that each plan holder’s balance was reduced by $253,199  given excessive fees 
being paid during the life of a 401(k) plan. 
Tibble v. Edison International: The Duty  To Continuously Review Plan Fees and 
Investments 
On May 18, 2015, by a unanimous 9–0 vote, the US Supreme Court,  in Tibble v. Edison Int’l , 135 S. Ct. 
1823 (U.S. 2015), held that fiduciaries of a 401(k) savings pla n have a “… continuing duty to monitor 
trust investments and to remove imprudent ones.” The court held  that this duty “… exists separate and 
apart from the trustee’s duty t o exercise prudence in selecting  investments” and that the fiduciary must 
“… systematically consider all the investments of the trust at regular intervals to ensure that they are 
appropriate.” 
As reported by Robert Powell in USA Today  on May 19, 2015 (“401(k) lawsuits just got easier”), the case 
involved an action brought by em ployees at Edison International . The employee-plaintiffs claimed that 
the six retail-class mutual funds c hosen by fiduciaries charged  with managing their 401(k) savings plan 
were imprudent. The plaintiffs pointed out that the plan was el igible to purchase identical, institutional-
class mutual funds that charged lower fees. 
 
35 Edison International, the defendant-employer, countered this ar gument by stating that its duties as a 
fiduciary of the 401(k) plan were governed by provisions of ERI SA, which specify a 6-year statute of 
limitations on the selection of investments. And because the fi duciaries selected the retail-class mutual 
funds in 1999, Edison contended that the statute of limitations  had expired by the time the case was 
brought in 2007. 
In rejecting this argument, the court concluded that the 6-year  statute of limitations was inapplicable 
because fiduciaries have what amounts to an unceasing duty  to evaluate a 401(k) plan’s fees and 
investments. Accordingly, as a result of the court’s holding in  this case, fiduciaries must conduct regular, 
periodic reviews to continuously  assess whether and to what ext ent an investment is appropriate and 
prudent. 
The lesson of Tibble v. Edison  for 401(k) plan fiduciaries is twofold. First, it established fiduciaries’ duty 
to continuously review plan investments as to whether the fees charged are the lowest for which a plan is 
eligible. Second, the case also created a duty for fiduciaries to remove underperforming investments.

37 Answers to Chapter 3 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. In a cash balance plan, benefits are defined in terms of an individual 
account balance. 
B. That’s correct! Defined benefit pension plans are retirement pl ans in which an employer promises

formula. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Defined contribution plans provide no  guarantee of a specific benefit 
amount. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. Individual retir ement annuities are r etirement plans established by 
individuals. 
2.  
A. This answer is inco rrect. Sick retirees still collect benefits.  
B. That’s correct! The ability to pay such benefits is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, the 
most important of which are employee mortality and expected rat e of return on employer

C. This answer is incorrect. If the  plan has foreign investments, the exchange rate would be 
considered along with other fact ors in projecting an expected r ate of return on employer 
contributions to the pension fund.

A. That’s correct! The best way to prevent such suits is to commun icate the benefit reductions. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. Transparency is more likely to accomp lish the desired results because it 
eliminates surprises. 
C. This answer is incorrect. If benefits for Grapefruit employees were also decreased, the number of 
sour employees who might sue would increase.

39 Chapter 4 
Underwriting Fiduciary Liability Insurance 
Overview 
Chapter 4 describes the major f actors that are involved in the process of underwriting fiduciary liability 
insurance policies. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify factors that insurers typically consider when setting premiums for fiduciary liability 
insurance, and 
 recognize the relevance of various factors that underwriters co nsider when deciding whether to 
provide fiduciary liability ins urance for a given organization.  
Factors in Pricing 
As is characteristic of most types of management liability insu rance, there is no rating bureau or pooling 
of loss experience among insurers writing fiduciary liability c overage. Thus, each com pany must develop 
its own rating approach based on actuarial analysis of its indi vidual loss experience. Pricing is therefore 
subjective and depends on an unde rwriter’s individual judgment concerning any particular fiduciary 
liability risk. 
Premiums for fiduciary liability insurance are most heavily inf luenced by (1) the total assets of the 
insured plans and (2) the numbe r of participants in the plan. I n addition, the nature of such plans (e.g., a 
401(k) program with a heavy concen tration of employer stock) pl ays a role in determining premium. 
Accordingly, premiums are also a ffected by the underwriter’s su bjective assessment of a given risk, rather 
than by applying a strict rating formula. 
Underwriting Factors 
In deciding whether to insure a given organization, underwriter s consider a number of key factors in 
underwriting fiduciary liability coverage. Such factors are lis ted in Exhibit 4.1 and discussed in the pages 
that follow. 
   
40 Exhibit 4.1 
Fiduciary Liability Underwriting Factors 
 Funding adequacy of defined benefit pension plans 
 Nature of plan investments 
 Single-employer versus multiemployer plans 
 Types of covered plans 
 Legal counsel’s opinion 
 Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm opinion 
 Profile of covered fiduciaries and directors and officers of t he organization 
 Formal loss control program 
Funding Adequacy of Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
A paramount consideration in assessing the insurability of a co mpany that sponsors one or more defined 
benefit pension plans is the ade quacy with which the plan(s) is  funded. To make the assessment as to 
whether contributions to the pl an will be large enough to pay p romised future benefits, underwriters must 
rely on the opinions of an actuary. Therefore, any qualificatio ns or caveats that appear in their actuarial 
reports should be carefully scru tinized and immediate changes m ade where shortfalls appear likely. 
Nature of Plan Investments 
The nature of the investments for both a defined benefit pensio n plan and a defined contribution plan is 
another important factor that underwriters assess. 
Regarding a defined benefit pens ion plan, underwriters evaluate  the investments’ diversification, assumed 
rate of return, overall level of  risk, and maturity structure. Since the duty to diversi fy assets is continually 
stressed throughout the Employee Retirement Income Security Act  (ERISA) of 1974, underwriters 
carefully review situations where a large percentage of a plan’ s funds are invested in a single investment 
vehicle. The extent to which a p lan’s portfolio is invested in “speculative” investments is also critical. 
Finally, the maturity structure of the assets should mesh prope rly with payout patterns anticipated under 
the covered plans. For example, i f a defined benefit plan holds  a substantial percentage of its assets in 
long-term bonds that do not mature for 20 to 30 years, this cou ld create a problem if a significant 
proportion of these assets will be needed to pay promised benef its within the next 10 years. 
As respects defined contribution plans, underwrite rs are most c oncerned about a heavy concentration of 
assets invested in company stock , discussed earlier in this cou rse. In addition, underwriters must also 
review the fees being charged for such plans, being mindful as to whether the fees are in line with those 
of similar plans. 
Single-Employer versus Multiemployer Plans 
Additional risks are posed by multiemployer benefit plans compa red with those generated by single-
employer programs. (Multiemployer plans are most often set up b y manufacturing firms or governmental 
employers that employ unionized  workers within the same industr y.) Since multiemployer plans are 
usually larger and more complex t han single-employer plans are,  claim frequency and claim severity tend 
to be higher than for single-employer plans. Of course, this is  reflected in higher premium rates for 
multiemployer plans.  
41 Types of Covered Plans 
The kinds of covered benefit plan s have a significant impact on  the insurability of a given fiduciary 
liability risk. More specifically, the size of the benefits pro mised and the duration over which such 
benefits must be paid heavily influence the risk of loss under a fiduciary policy. For instance, there is a 
risk of insolvency associated w ith a defined benefit pension pl an, whereas little such risk exists for a 
defined contribution pension plan. This is because the sponsori ng company assumes the financial 
responsibility for making specified, promised payments under a defined benefit pension plan. In contrast, 
under a defined contribution plan, the risk associated with fut ure payments is shifted entirely to the plan’s 
participants. However, as alr eady discussed, defined contributi on plans are not without other significant 
risks. 
Legal Counsel’s Opinion 
Underwriters must also rely on the opinions of a plan’s attorne y to evaluate the extent of its compliance 
with ERISA law. It is not uncommon for a given plan to fail one  or more compliance tests, given the 
number and complexity of ERISA rules and regulations. Thus, a “ clean” opinion from the plan’s law firm 
is critical. 
CPA Firm’s Opinion 
Periodic, comprehensive ERISA a udits, normally conducted by Cer tified Public Accountant (CPA) firms 
with particular expertise in suc h matters, can also substantial ly reduce an insured’s exposure to claims. 
Accordingly, some underwriters will grant premium credits to in sureds that submit to audits. 
Profile of Covered Fiduciaries 
As is the case with directors and officers (D&O) liability insu rance, underwriters seek to insure only 
reputable fiduciaries. Accordingl y, underwriters evaluate the i ntegrity, experience, and knowledge of both 
the insured fiduciaries as well as the outside services provide rs they have hired to administer the 
applicable benefit programs. 
Loss Control Program 
The extent to which an organiza tion adopts the kinds of measure s described above will reduce its likely 
exposure to claims and is yet a nother important underwriting fa ctor. Companies that implement such 
approaches will generally receive f avorable underwriter conside ration, from both a premium as well as a 
coverage standpoint.  
42 Chapter 4 Review Questions 
1. Pricing fiduciary liability insurance is 
A. based on many insurers’ p ooled loss experience. 
B. done by a rating bureau. 
C. entirely objective, based on statistical data. 
D. inconsistent among insurers, each  of whom might use a different  approach. 
2. Underwriters who underw rite fiduciary liability coverage typica lly consider all the following 
underwriting factors, except 
A. funding adequacy of defined contribution pension plans. 
B. the background of covered fiduciaries. 
C. the nature of plan investments. 
D. the types of covered plans. 
3. It seems to be hard to find an  insurer willing to underwrite fi duciary liability insurance that will 
cover Pyar Square Company’s “Ci rcle-of-Life” defined benefit re tirement plan, which has built a 
strong asset base thanks to its investment portfolio that consi sts primarily of two very different 
asset types: (1) Pyar Square’s own  stock and (2) high-interest (“junk”) bonds. Underwriters’ 
reluctance is probably based on all of the following factors, e xcept 
A. extensive use of “speculative” investments. 
B. lack of diversification. 
C. level of risk. 
D. misleading plan name. 
4. The exposures of defined benefit plans and defined contribution  plans depend, in part, on the 
entity that assumes the plan’s f inancial risk, which is the 
A. investment management company ch arged with the duty of investin g plan assets. 
B. participants with a defined ben efit pension plan and the sponso r with a defined 
contribution program. 
C. sponsor with a defined benefit pension plan and the participant s with a defined 
contribution program. 
D. sponsor with both defined benef it and defined contribution prog rams. 
5. One of the doctors who runs Hickory Dickory Hospital has raised  the concern Hickory Dickory’s 
employee benefits might somehow  be out of compliance with the c omplexities of Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) law. If that is the case , it might be difficult for the 
hospital to obtain fiduciary lia bility insurance. How can Hicko ry Dickory ascertain whether it 
meets ERISA requirements?

43 Answers to Chapter 4 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. There is no pooling of loss experienc e among insurers writing fiduciary 
liability coverage. 
B. This answer is incorrect. There is no rating bureau for insurer s writing fiduciary liability coverage. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Pricin g is subjective because each co mpany’s rating approach is based on 
its actuaries’ analysis of its own loss experience. 
D. That’s correct! Each company mu st develop its own rating approa ch. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! Funding adequacy  is an underwriting factor for defined benefit plans. Employees 
bear the risks with defined contribution plans. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Underwriting factors include the prof ile of covered fiduciaries and 
directors and officers of the organization. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Underwriting factors include the natu re of plan investments. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Underwriting factors include the type s of covered plans. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Junk bonds are high-risk investments.  
B. This answer is incorrect. Pyar S quare’s plan assets are heavily  concentrated in two areas. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Underwriters evaluate a plan’s level of risk, which seems high in this 
case due to a lack of diversification and heavy investment in t he sponsoring organization’s own 
stock. 
D. That’s correct! The plan’s name is normally not an important un derwriting criterion. Even though 
retirement plans essentially apply only to the end of an employ ee’s life cycle, the “Circle-of-Life” 
name does not seem to create un realistic expectations of a type  that would lead to a lawsuit. Other 
characteristics of this plan are much more problematic. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The i nvestment management company doe s not assume the plan’s 
financial risk. Howeve r, an investment management company faces  its own business risks. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The sponsor assume s the risks with a defined benefit pension plan. 
C. That’s correct! The sponsoring c ompany assumes the financial ri sk under a defined benefit 
pension plan, while in contrast , this risk is shifted entirely to the plan’s participants under a 
defined contribution program. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Partic ipants assume the risks with a defined contribution program. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Most loss control departments do not deal with legal opinions. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The underwriter will be looking for d ocumentation from the Hickory 
Dickory docs. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Accountants are not equipped to provi de a legal opinion. 
D. That’s correct! Underwriters will rely on the opinions of a pla n’s attorney to evaluate the extent of 
its compliance with ERISA law; a “clean” opinion from the plan’ s law firm is critical.

Fiduciary Liability Loss Control 
Overview 
Chapter 5 provides methods of reducing exposures to liability c laims against fiduciaries. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the types of measures that can reduce the likely frequ ency or severity of fiduciary 
liability claims, and 
 recognize the applicability of these loss control measures in a  given situation. 
Various techniques can assist per sons who have fiduciary respon sibilities, in reducing the exposure to 
claims against them. These techniques are summarized in Exhibit  5.1 and discussed in the pages that 
follow. 
Exhibit 5.1 
Fiduciary Liability Loss Control Measures 
 Minimize and, if possible, avoid investments in company stock.  
 Select and evaluate fiduciaries carefully. 
 Structure benefit plans with “moderate” fees. 
 Conduct periodic, independent Employee Retirement Income Secur ity Act (ERISA) of 
1974 compliance audits. 
 Use “experts” to design benefit plans. 
 Fund plans adequately. 
 Invest plan assets prudently. 
 Avoid conflicts of interest. 
 Avoid prohibited transactions. 
 Report and disclose plan in formation as required. 
Minimize and, If Possible, Avo id Investments in Company Stock 
The problematic nature of holding company stock within a define d contribution pension plan (i.e., a 
401(k) plan), is thoroughly analyzed in Chapter 5 of this cours e. Admittedly, employee ownership of 
company stock in a 401(k) plan can serve as a way to align the interests of employees and employers, 
potentially leading to better future company performance. There  are, however, a number of significant 
risks when 401(k) plans make c ompany stock available as one of the plan’s investment options. 
 For employees, by making a substantial investment in company st ock, the employee is in effect 
“betting” his or her retiremen t on the company’s fortunes.  
45  For employers, when the company’ s financial picture darkens and  the shares of its stock 
plummet, the organization’s di rectors and officers will likely be faced with shareholder class 
action lawsuits alleging mismanag ement of the corporation. In a ddition, if company stock is made 
an investment choice within a 401(k) plan, the employees’ plan balances will be adversely 
affected, a situation that will also probably result in lawsuit s against the plan’s fiduciaries, 
creating so-called ERISA stock drop claims. 
Given the substantial risks to  both employees and fiduciaries, company stock should not be available as 
an investment option within defined contribution benefit plans.  
Select and Evaluate Outside Service Providers Carefully 
The ultimate responsibility for controlling the risks associate d with pension and benefit plans rests with 
the individuals who provide services to the insured organizatio n’s covered plans. Such persons include 
administrators, investment advisers, actuaries, and accountants . Thus, fiduciaries must select these 
persons and firms on the basis of  their experience, expertise, and integrity, rather than for personal or 
political reasons. 
Structure Benefit Plans with “Moderate” Fees 
During the past decade, lawsuits against fiduciaries are increa singly asserting that the sponsors of defined 
contribution plans (i.e., 401(k) plans) have allowed plan admin istrators and other plan service providers to 
charge exorbitant fees. As repor ted on August 11, 2016, by Tara  Siegel Bernard of the New York Times  
(“Employees Sue Four More Universities over Retirement Plan Fee s”), there has been a wave of lawsuits 
filed against an array of prestigious universities acting as re tirement plan sponsors, including (but not 
limited to) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Yale, Duke, Johns Hopkins, and Vanderbilt. 
The root complaint common to each of these lawsuits is that the  universities could have, in one way or 
another, negotiated lower fees for their employees’ respective retirement plans. 
The failure to negotiate lower f ees constitutes a breach of dut y under ERISA, a conclusion supported by 
the United States Supreme Court in Tibble v. Edison Int’l,  135 S. Ct. 1823 (U.S. 2015), a case discussed 
at length in Chapter 3 of this course. 
Given the risks associated with a  class action lawsuit alleging  that 401(k) plan participants were charged 
excessive fees, employers should obtain multiple quotations whe n setting up or modifying 401(k) plans 
and, all other things being equal, select the plan administrato r charging the lowest fees. Moreover, 
administrators must continually monitor the fees being charged by established plans, to be sure that fees 
are among the lowest available for the type of investment being  offered. 
Conduct Periodic, Independent ERISA Compliance Audits 
Fiduciaries must arrange for periodic audits of their benefit p lans, to be conducted by independent 
organizations, in an effort to assu re compliance with ERISA reg ulations. (These should be in addition to 
regular, company-wide audits by Certified Public Accountant (CP A) firms.) Although significant costs 
are associated with such procedures (e.g., fees and management time to assist auditors), consultation with 
persons conversant in the complex ities of ERISA can lower the i ncidence of claims against fiduciaries. 
A routine audit should be done each year, and a comprehensive a udit performed every 5 years. Routine 
audits concentrate on a plan’s compliance with ERISA regulation s and procedures, whereas 
comprehensive ones are more focu sed on the nature of a plan’s a ssets. For instance, a comprehensive 
audit would assess the specific investments held by a defined b enefit pension plan, such as its individual 
stocks, bonds, and real estate investments.  
46 Use Experts To Design Plans 
Designing pension and benefit pl ans requires considerable exper tise. Fiduciaries should enlist the 
assistance of CPAs and actuaries who specialize in creating suc h plans rather than rely on in-house 
personnel whose background in this area may be limited. Many of  the problems plaguing pension and 
welfare programs stem from erro rs or inadequacies in the basic design of the plans. 
Fund Plans Adequately 
Inadequate funding of defined bene fit pension plans—and their s ubsequent inability to pay promised 
benefits—are frequent sources of c laims against fiduciaries. Ha ving periodic audits conducted by an 
independent CPA firm and hiring  an independent actuary to certi fy that the plans are adequately funded 
will usually prevent t he problems associated with underfunded p lans. This is especially true if an audit 
and an actuarial analysis are performed in the early stages of a potential funding inadequacy, which 
allows more time for such i nadequacies to be corrected. 
Invest Plan Assets Prudently 
Many of the difficulties experienced by defined benefit pension  plans are the result of imprudent 
investments. Often, pension monies are invested in too high a p roportion of risky alternatives. In other 
cases, fiduciaries fail to diversify adequately. Because fiduci aries can be held liable for negligence in 
selecting and supervising outsid e service providers, use of an experienced, independent investment 
adviser with a strong track record is desirable. Additionally, fiduciaries should conduct periodic reviews 
of a plan’s investment objectiv es, as well as assess the extent  to which these objectives are being met by 
the outside advisory organization. 
As noted in Chapter 1 of this course, one means of providing a layer of insulation from liability for 
imprudent investment decisions is for an insured to retain an a dviser who is registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940. This will afford an insured org anization’s fiduciaries a valid defense 
should allegations be made that fiduciaries were negligent in s electing an investment adviser. This 
protection arises from the fact that corporate fiduciaries cann ot be held liable for an  investment manager’s 
imprudent decisions. They can onl y be found liable for negligen tly selecting the investment manager. 
Avoid Conflicts of Interest 
Just as corporate directors and officers must avoid conflicts o f interest in managing the affairs of the 
organization, so too should indi viduals charged with the respon sibility of overseeing pension and benefit 
programs. A high percentage of cl aims against fiduciaries alleg e some form of self-dealing, and affected 
individuals should take particular  care when potential conflict s of interest could be alleged. (This is 
particularly true as respects party-in-interest transactions, w hich are discussed in Chapter 1.) More 
specifically, the following pr actices should be avoided. 
 Selecting investments in which a fiduciary has a personal stake  
 Use of an outside service provider (e.g., actuary, CPA, legal c ounsel) who is an associate or a 
relative of the fiduciary 
 Changes in plans that would accr ue substantial benefit to, or e nrich, an individual fiduciary 
   
47 The First Union Lawsuits: A Case Study in Conflicts of Interest (Defined 
Contribution Plan) 
Conflicts of interest involving fiduciaries were the impetus fo r class action lawsuits brought against First 
Union Corporation by its employees in 1997. The lawsuits made t wo key allegations. 
 Lack of Investment Options . The first allegation was that present and former 401(k) plan 
participants were given no option but to invest their contribut ions exclusively in mutual funds 
managed by First Union. The basis of the plan participants’ cla ims was that the performance of 
these mutual funds lagged those of comparable mutual funds. The  employee-claimants alleged 
that by increasing the size of these mutual funds, First Union made its mutual funds more 
attractive to investors, to the detriment of its employees. And  even if the funds had performed 
well, the question arose as to whether First Union’s intent was  to benefit itself or its employees. 
 Excessive Management Fees . Second, the lawsuits alleged tha t First Union’s mutual funds 
charged higher investment manag ement fees to manage its own def ined contribution plan than it 
charged to outside clients. More over, the First Union defined c ontribution fund was also First 
Union’s investment management group’s largest client. Again, ev en if the First Union employees’ 
pension fund performed well, t here was a clear conflict of inte rest inherent in such practices. 
Ultimately, First Union agreed to settle the lawsuits for $25 m illion. 
Metropolitan Life v. Glenn: A Case Stud y in Conflicts of Interest (Employee 
Welfare Benefit Plan) 
Wanda Glenn, an employee of Sears , Roebuck & Company, was cover ed by the Sears long-term 
disability insurance plan. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company both administered and provided the 
insurance coverage for the plan . When Ms. Glenn applied for con tinuing disability benefits, MetLife 
denied her claim. The US Supreme Court, in ruling in favor of M s. Glenn, in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. 
Glenn , 554 U.S. 105 (2008), found that  Metropolitan Life, as plan ad ministrator, was operating under a 
conflict of interest because any benefits it granted in the rol e of administrator would also be paid as the 
plan’s insurer and ultimately to MetLife’s financial detriment.  To prevent such conflicts, employers 
should review all employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERI SA and confirm that they have a claims 
procedure that separates eligibility determination from the ins urance payment decision. Accordingly, 
where appropriate, outsourcing of  the claims process should be considered, to avoid the conflict of 
interest problem in the Glenn  case. 
Avoid Prohibited Transactions 
Given the intricacy of ERISA, avoiding prohibited transactions is not always a clear-cut process. 
Although some transactions cons titute obvious violations, other s do not and could be easily overlooked. 
Consequently, independent outsi de legal counsel should be sough t when gray-area situations arise. (An 
example of a prohibited transacti on would be one where a fiduci ary of a defined benefit pension plan 
invests plan monies in a company where he or she holds a majori ty interest. However, such transactions 
are not always so easily apparent.) 
Report and Disclose Plan Information as Required 
Passage of ERISA created the need to file myriad reports to fed eral agencies; in particular, annual reports 
must be provided to the following. 
 Department of Labor 
 Internal Revenue Service 
 Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (for defined benefit pensi on plans)  
48 Also, reports may need to be file d with the Social Security Adm inistration and made available for 
inspection by plan participants . Finally, special procedures ma y be needed to complete reports when the 
following events occur. 
 Plan provisions are materially changed. 
 A plan is terminated or partially terminated. 
 A plan is merged with another or its assets are spun off. 
Severe penalties for noncompliance and failure to file can resu lt in fines of up to $1,000 per day. 
Consequently, every effort must be made not to run afoul of the se regulations, which could increase a 
fiduciary’s exposure to liability. 
It should also be mentioned that compliance with the ERISA repo rt filing requirements is not, by itself, a 
complete defense to a fiduciary  liability claim. However, failu re to comply with such regulations heavily 
increases the possibility that liability will ultimately attach .

52 Chapter 6 
Coordinating Fiduciary Liability Insurance with Other Coverages 
Overview 
The manner in which fiduciary liability coverage must be coordi nated with other types of insurance has 
long been a source of confusion. C hapter 6 examines the potenti al gaps and overlap s that can occur 
between fiduciary liability and these related coverages and pro poses ways to address these coordination 
issues. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the distinctions between fiduciary liability insuranc e and other management liability 
coverages, 
 identify the different ways of structuring fiduciary liability insurance, and 
 identify advantages and disadvant ages of each available approac h. 
Fiduciary Liability versus Em ployee Benefits Liability 
Fiduciary liability insurance c overs claims alleging breach of the duties enumerated by the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (i.e., discretio nary duties). In contrast, employee 
benefits liability coverage appli es to claims involving adminis trative errors associated with employee 
pension and welfare plans. Exhibit 6.1 illustrates several clai m scenarios that correspond to the types of 
claims addressed by a policy covering the employee benefits lia bility exposures, which are distinct from 
claims arising from duties enumerated within ERISA.

Claim Scenario

An employer offers a 401(k) savings plan. The company's employee
benefits administrator suggests that an employee, who seeks capital
preservation, put his contributions into an aggressive growth stock
fund. The employer is sued when the fund loses 30 percent of its
value after a stock market crash.

Based on a defined benefit pension plan administrator's erroneous
calculation of an expected monthly pension benefit, an employee
elects early retirement. The employee sues when his initial monthly
check is significantly less than the administrator calculated.

Following his divorce, an employee elects to change the beneficiary
on his life insurance policy from his ex-wife to his son. He advises
the company’s benefits administrator accordingly, but the change is
never made. Six months later, the employee dies, at which time his
son sues because he cannot collect under the policy.

A company's benefits administrator forgets to enroll a new employee
in the firm's medical plan. The employee sues after the plan denies
her medical benefits following a diagnosis of cancer.
 
The ISO Employee Benefits Liability Coverage Endorsement 
In response to the employee bene fits liability exposure, Insura nce Services Office, Inc. (ISO), has 
developed the “Employee Benef its Liability Coverage” (CG 04 35 12 07) endorsement for attachment to 
commercial general liability (CGL) policies. The endorsement co vers this exposure, although not the 
exposure to fiduciary liability. 
Is an Employee Benefits Liability Endorsement Worthwhile? 
Despite the coverage it provides, an employee benefits liabilit y endorsement is of little value. Any firm 
having an employee benefits lia bility exposure also has a fiduc iary liability exposure. Therefore, buying 
only an employee benefits liability endorsement under a CGL pol icy and not purchasing a fiduciary 
liability policy form leaves the o rganization uncovered for fid uciary liability claims. This is because 
employee benefits liability policies do not  cover fiduciary liability expos ures. Moreover, there is little  or 
no advantage to buying both an e mployee benefits liability endo rsement and a fiduciary liability policy 
since virtually every fiduciary liability policy also covers th e employee benefits liability exposure. In fact, 
buying both a fiduciary liability policy and an employee benefi ts liability endorsement creates a situation 
where duplicate coverage exists. 
Considering this situation, purchasing an employee benefits lia bility endorsement to a CGL policy is 
rarely, if ever, necessary. 
Stand-Alone versus Packaged App roaches to Fiduciary Liability 
Coverage 
In recent years, a packaged appro ach to obtaining fiduciary lia bility insurance h as become increasingly 
popular. Specifically, insurers have begun to offer fiduciary c overage along with directors and officers 
(D&O), employment practices liability (EPL), and sometimes cybe r and privacy policies. These coverage 
formats are known as management liability package policies. (Oc casionally, kidnap and ransom 
insurance, also known as “special crime” coverage, is also made  available within a package, along with 
these other four policies.) 
 
54 Advantages of the Packaged Approach 
A packaged approach features sep arate insuring agreements and s eparate policy limits for each of the 
coverages provided (i.e., D&O, emp loyment practices, fiduciary,  cyber and privacy, kidnap/ransom). 
Accordingly, package policies provide essentially the same scop e of coverage that is afforded by a stand-
alone fiduciary liability policy . In addition, pricing is usual ly somewhat lower than that found in a stand-
alone fiduciary liability polic y. This is because there are und erwriting economies of scale under these 
circumstances. Since much of th e same information used to under write D&O, EPL, and cyber and privacy 
coverage is also required when  underwriting a fiduciary liabili ty policy, the total cost of a management 
liability package policy will be  roughly 10–20 percent lower th an the total cost of buying these 
“component” policies on an individual basis. 
Approach to Limits 
Most often, but not always, man agement liability package polici es are written with separate limits for 
each of the individual coverages they provide. In a minority of  cases, these policies are written with a 
combined single limit that applies to all types of management l iability claims during a single policy 
period. 
For example, a management liability policy containing a $10 mil lion combined aggregate limit would 
cover all D&O, EPL, and fiduciary  claims during a policy period  up to $10 million, in any proportion. 
Contrast this plan of coverage w ith an insured that buys a mana gement liability package policy containing 
the following individual limits: D&O ($5 million), EPL ($3 mill ion), and fiduciary ($2 million). 
 
In both cases, available limits total $10 million. However, in the first instance, the insured can apply the 
$10 million in any proportion, regardless of the type of claim involved. Conversely, in the second 
instance, specific limits apply to each of the three coverages.  
A combined aggregate limit approach is advantageous if, for exa mple, there is an especially large (i.e., 
$10 million) fiduciary liability  claim, which would have exhaus ted the $2 million of coverage available 
under the policy written with separate limits. On the other han d, it should be recognized that a policy with 
a $10 million combined aggregate l imit applying to all coverage s will cost about 15–25 percent more than 
a policy with separate limits totaling $10 million of coverage.  
 
55 Limitations of the Packaged Approach 
A package policy approach to obt aining fiduciary liability cove rage may not always provide the optimal 
solution to a company’s fiduciary coverage needs. For example, a privately held business may sometimes 
elect not to purchase a D&O polic y despite the fact that the co mpany wants fiduciary liability coverage 
(and perhaps EPL insurance, as well). Yet, in this situation, m any underwriters will not offer a package 
policy unless an insured buys all three coverage components. In  these cases, a stand-alone fiduciary 
liability policy becomes the comp any’s only available option.

58 Answers to Chapter 6 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Insura nce Services Office, Inc. (ISO) , has developed an employee 
benefits liability endorsement designed for attachment to ISO’s  CGL policies. 
B. This answer is incorrect. It is usually possible to purchase a package policy that also covers a 
firm’s employee benefits liability exposure. 
C. This answer is incorrect. These package policies have become in creasingly popular in recent 
years. 
D. That’s correct! Employee benef its liability coverage is rarely,  if ever, written on a stand-alone 
basis. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. This should be submitted as an employ ee benefits liability claim. 
B. That’s correct! This is the type  of claim that fiduciary liabil ity insurance would address. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Empl oyee benefits liability insurance  applies to counseling claims. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Empl oyee benefits liability insurance  applies to claims involving 
interpretation of employee benefit programs. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The endorsement does not add fiduciar y liability coverage. 
B. That’s correct! The endorsement adds employee benefits liabilit y coverage but does not address 
the fiduciary liability exposure that organizations with employ ee benefits also face. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The endorsement adds employee benefit s liability coverage. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The employee benefits liability endor sement is not an exclusionary 
endorsement; it does add some coverage. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Due to  economics of scale, package po licy pricing is usually somewhat 
lower than that found in a stan d-alone fiduciary liability poli cy.

liability coverage is also require d when underwriting fiduciary  liability coverage. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Usually, though not always, package p olicies have separate limits for 
each of the individual coverages. 
5.  
A. That’s correct! Assuming no other  claims exist, the policy coul d provide up to $3 million to cover 
a D&O claim, an EPL claim, o r a fiduciary liability claim. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Payment of a claim under any of the t hree coverages will reduce the 
amount of coverage available for a future claim under any of th e three coverages.

Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage: Insuring Agreements, Covered Persons, and Covered Organizations 
Overview 
This chapter describes the insuring agreements found within fid uciary liability insurance policy forms. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the two insuring agreements found within fiduciary lia bility policy forms, 
 recognize the extent to which coverage under each of these insu ring agreements applies in a 
typical fiduciary liability policy, and 
 identify the persons and organi zations covered by a typical fid uciary liability policy. 
As Chapter 1 notes, the fiducia ry liability exposure actually e xisted prior to the passage of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 because persons who managed employee benefits 
programs were already legally lia ble for any “nondiscretionary”  errors or omissions they committed in 
conjunction with such plans (e.g ., failing to change a benefici ary designation on a life insurance policy). 
ERISA broadened the scope of su ch liability in two key ways. 
First, it transformed liability associated with benefit plan ma nagement into a “personal” rather than 
simply a “corporate” obligation. This means that under ERISA, t he personal assets of a fiduciary can be 
confiscated to restore any losses suffered by a covered plan if  the losses were caused by the fiduciary’s 
negligence. (In that sense, fiduc iary liability coverage functi ons in a manner similar to that of directors 
and officers (D&O) liability insurance, because fiduciary liabi lity coverage also protects the personal 
assets of those persons who serve as fiduciaries, just as D&O l iability coverage protects the personal 
assets of those who serve on boards of directors.) 
Second, ERISA created liability for the discretionary functions  handled by persons who manage corporate 
employee benefit plans. These discretionary functions include ( but are not limited to) duties such as 
selecting a competent investment  manager for a defined benefit pension plan, choosing a 401(k) program 
with a “reasonable” annual fee , and deciding on a medical insur ance plan that is appropriate to the needs 
of a company’s employees. 
Given the newly created personal liability of fiduciaries along  with liability for discretionary acts imposed 
by ERISA, fiduciary liability insurance first appeared soon aft er the Act’s passage and immediately 
became an essential part of all corporate insurance portfolios.   
60 Insuring Agreements 
There are two major insuring agreements within fiduciary liabil ity policy forms. The first covers 
“fiduciary liability” (known as Coverage A), and the second cov ers “settlement programs” (known as 
Coverage B), also sometimes referred to as voluntary compliance  program coverage. 
Coverage A: Fiduciary Liability Coverage 
The coverage provided under the policies’ fiduciary liability i nsuring agreement applies to liability in 
conjunction with 
a. fiduciary (i.e., discretionary) duties, 
b. administrative (i.e., nondiscretionary) duties, 
c. claims made against the fiducia ries simply as a matter of their  legal status as fiduciaries 
(regardless of whether such liab ility is the result of their sp ecific acts), and 
d. claims involving the acts of third parties (e.g., third-party a dministrators of benefit plans) for 
whom a fiduciary may be vicariously liable. 
Coverage for Fiduciary (Discretionary) Duties 
Coverage A applies to breaches of  duties committed by the insur eds in conjunction with benefit plans that 
are (1) subject to ERISA and (2) not subject to ERISA. (As poin ted out in Chapter 2, not all employee 
benefit plans are subject to ERISA.) Liability under both types  of plans results from errors in 
discretionary functions (e.g., fa ilure to select a competent pe nsion fund manager), as opposed to errors 
that are considered ministerial or administrative duties (e.g.,  inadvertent failure to enroll a new employee 
in the company’s 401(k) savings program). 
Coverage for Administrative (N ondiscretionary) Duties: Employee  Benefits Liability 
Coverage 
In addition to covering fiduciar y liability exposures (above), Coverage A also applies to liability for acts 
that involve purely administrative errors and omissions associa ted with managing pension and benefit 
plans. Examples of administrative errors were noted in Chapter 1 and include (but are not limited to) such 
acts as stating an incorrect pension amount when questioned by an employee as to what he or she can 
expect to receive as a monthly benefit upon retirement. 
Coverage for Liability Based on Status as a Fiduciary 
Coverage A also covers  fiduciaries based solely on their status  as covered fiduciaries under the policy. 
Such a provision is important because in some claim situations,  all “fiduciaries” (including persons who 
did not actively participate in causing a claim) are named in a  lawsuit, despite the fact that the lawsuit 
does not allege specific acts of negligence or breaches of fidu ciary duties by one or more of these 
fiduciaries. 
Consider the following example. In a lawsuit, Fiduciary “A” is alleged to have committed a wrongful act 
in conjunction with an employee benefit plan. In addition, Fidu ciaries “B,” “C,” and “D” are named in the 
lawsuit, even though there is no specific wrongful act alleged against “B,” “C,” or “D.” Rather, they are 
named in the suit simply because they are also fiduciaries unde r the same benefit plans as Fiduciary “A.” 
This approach to coverage is si milar to what is found within D& O liability insurance policies. That is, 
coverage under D&O forms also a pplies to directors and officers  based solely on their status as directors 
and officers of the corporate organization—even if a lawsuit do es not indicate that one or more such 
individuals committed any wrongful acts or were negligent in pe rforming their required duties.  
61 Coverage for Vicarious Liabilit y for Acts of Third Parties 
Coverage A also covers  “any person for whose Wrongful Acts the Insureds are legally responsible.” 
Vicarious liability coverage is critical because, under ERISA, a fiduciary can be held liable for the acts, 
errors, or omissions of those persons or entities that provide services to employee benefit plans, as was 
discussed in Chapter 1. 
As a matter of common practice, fiduciaries frequently delegate  a number of duties to organizations and 
individuals who are outside of their own company. For example, the design and management of a firm’s 
pension and welfare plans often require a corporation to hire a  number of outside entities such as 
actuaries, consultants, and investment managers. Should any of these entities commit errors or omissions 
that cause a loss to the beneficia ries of the covered plans or act in contravention of ERISA, the fiduciary 
sponsoring the plan can be held liable for the acts of such par ties. Consequently, fiduciary liability 
policies also cover the corporation sponsoring the benefit prog rams and the individual fiduciaries’ 
liability for the acts, errors, and omissions of such third-par ty/outside service providers. 
Coverage Applies for Vicarious Liability Only 
It should be emphasized, however, t hat coverage for such liabil ity is vicarious, not direct. Thus, outside 
organizations working with the ins ured organizations are not in sureds under the policy. Rather, the 
policies cover only the sponsor organization’s vicarious liabil ity for the acts of these outside entities. 
For example, if both the insured organization and an outside or ganization are sued in conjunction with an 
alleged wrongful act, coverage unde r the insured organization’s  fiduciary liability policy does not apply 
to the outside organization directly. Rather, the insured organ ization’s fiduciary liability coverage will 
only respond if the outside organ ization is unable to assume fi nancial responsibility for its own acts or 
omissions. 
Given this situation, organizations that hire third-party servi ce providers to assist in administering their 
employee benefit plans should carefully check such entities’ pr ofessional liability insurance coverage 
before commencing a business relationship with them. 
Coverage B: Coverage for Settlement Programs/Voluntary Compliance Programs 
“Settlement programs” are progr ams operated by various governme nt organizations to resolve disputes 
regarding pension and benefit pl ans. (Settlement programs are a lso referred to as “Voluntary Compliance 
Programs.”) This insuring agreeme nt pays the cost of what are k nown as “voluntary compliance fees.” 
Voluntary compliance fees are payments made to correct “deficie ncies” in benefit programs operated by 
the insured organization. (Deficiencies refer to amounts by whi ch defined benefit plans are underfunded.) 
The Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS), operat ed under the auspices of the US 
Department of Labor, provides an a dministrative process for arr iving at such settlements. This process is 
advantageous because it eliminat es the high legal costs associa ted with the formal litigation process. Note, 
however, that fiduciary liabilit y policies do not cover actual funding deficiencies. Rather, they only cover 
the administrative fees associated with arriving at voluntary s ettlements under the EPCRS process. 
Settlement programs avoid the time and expense of formal litiga tion and are administered by federal 
agencies such as the Internal R evenue Service (IRS) and the US Department of Labor. To be eligible to 
receive coverage under this insur ing agreement, the insured mus t first notify the insurer of the fact that a 
dispute is being submitted to a voluntary settlement. In other words, the insurer must have prior notice of 
the settlement. 
Key Coverage Extensions within Fiduciary Liability Policies 
In addition to what is provided within Coverage A (Fiduciary Li ability) and Coverage B (Settlement 
Programs/Voluntary Compliance Pr ograms), there are a number of coverage extensions that some, but not  
62 all, insurers provide. Such cove rage is afforded in one of thre e ways: (a) as a separate insuring agreement, 
(b) within a policy’s definiti on of “covered loss” or “covered claim,” or (c) by means of an endorsement 
to the policy. These extensions a re listed in Exhibit 7.1 and d iscussed in the following pages. 
Exhibit 7.1  
Key Extensions within Fiduciary Liability Policies  
 Settlor Coverage 
 Managed Care Coverage 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of  1996 Claim 
Coverage 
 Coverage for 502(c) penalties 
 Coverage for Investigations by Various Government Agencies 
Settlor Coverage 
Every fiduciary liability policy form covers insureds for liabi lity they incur when they act as a fiduciary. 
However, some, but by no means all, such policies also cover in sureds for the liability they incur when 
they act as a settlor . The case of Federal Ins. Co. v . International Bus. Machs. Cor p., 18 N.Y.3d 642, 942 
N.Y.S.2d 432, 965 N.E.2d 934 (2012), illustrates this important  concept. 
Federal Insurance Company v. IBM : Coverage for Fiduciary but Not Settlor Acts 
A class action lawsuit was brought against IBM by a group of em ployee beneficiaries of IBM’s pension 
plans. The employees contended th at various changes IBM made to  these plans violated ERISA’s 
antidiscrimination provisions. I BM settled the claim and then s ought reimbursement of the attorney’s fees 
it paid to reach the settlement from Federal Insurance, IBM’s e xcess fiduciary insurer. 
The New York Court of Appeals’ Ruling   
In denying coverage, Federal took the position, which the New Y ork Court of Appeals upheld, that 
enacting amendments to a benefit plan was not the duty of a fid uciary but rather that of a settlor. Federal 
pointed out that the plaintiffs ’ complaint did not assert that IBM had breached its fiduciary duties. Instead, 
the plaintiffs claimed that in c hanging from a defined benefit plan to a cash balance plan, IBM had 
discriminated against certain (older) employees. The New York C ourt of Appeals agreed with Chubb that 
no coverage applied to this clai m for two reasons. First, chang ing the nature of a benefit plan is 
considered the act of a settlor rather than a fiduciary. Second , because ERISA imposes no responsibilities, 
obligations, or duties on settlors , there was no coverage for t he claim under its policy. 
Given the fact that fiduciaries routinely perform settlor funct ions, when arranging fiduciary liability 
insurance insureds should secure a ffirmative coverage for both fiduciary and settlor acts (which, as 
explained below, is offered by s ome, but by no means all, fiduc iary liability insurers). 
The “Benefits Due” Exclusion 
However, it should be noted that even if explicit coverage for settlor acts is provided under fiduciary 
liability policies, such polici es will still be limited to cove ring only the cost of defense associated with 
claims alleging that a settlor acted wrongfully. 
Thus, in the Federal Ins. Co. v. IBM  case referred to above, even in  the absence of a dispute as to  the 
existence of coverage for se ttlor functions, there would still have been no reimbursement to IBM for the 
damages suffered by the plaintiffs and paid in the settlement. Rather, the bone of contention was coverage 
for the monies that IBM expended in defending the claim.  
63 The lack of coverage for actual benefit payments results becaus e a standard exclusion found within 
virtually all fiduciary liability policy forms, known as the “b enefits due” exclusion, precludes coverage 
for such payments. (This exclu sion is discussed in detail later  in this chapter.) 
Despite the Benefits Due Exclusion, Defense Coverage Can Be Valuable 
One final note on the benefits due exclusion: although defense- only coverage may seem like relatively 
“thin soup,” recognize that in the IBM litigation, defense costs amounted to a whopping $88 million! This 
a considerable sum, even for a business the size of IBM. 
Filling the Gap in Coverage for Settlor Acts 
A handful of insurers have res ponded to the gap in coverage for  settlor acts. Most do so by means of an 
endorsement that amends the “wr ongful act” definition to includ e various settlor acts, for which 
additional premium (typically 5–10 percent) is required. Other insurers afford settlor coverage within 
their regular policy forms. 
Managed Care Coverage 
Although fiduciary liability polic ies exclude coverage for bodi ly injury, property damage, and personal 
injury (as will be noted elsewhere  in this chapter), most of th e policies contain a managed care coverage 
extension (generally as a separate coverage provision within th e policy and less often as a standard 
endorsement to the policy) that affirmatively covers bodily inj ury, sickness, mental or emotional distress, 
disease, or death when such even ts result from the administrati on of managed care plans. In view of the 
fact that managed care plans are subject to ERISA, this is appr opriate and, of course, represents a 
substantial exposure to emplo yers sponsoring such plans. 
When Managed Care Coverage Applies 
The two most common claim scenar ios associated with managed car e exposures involve an injured 
employee-claimant suing an employer-sponsor of a managed care p lan, alleging the following. 
1. that the employer-sponsor of a managed care plan negligently se lected the managed care plan 
provider; or 
2. that an employer-sponsored manag ed care plan wrongly denied or delayed medical benefits 
provided by the plan. 
HIPAA Claim Coverage  
This coverage extension applies to claims alleging that the ins ured violated the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, a law that protects employees’ health insurance 
coverage when they lose their j obs or change jobs. The law also  promulgates standard s for the privacy of 
electronic healthcare records and transactions. 
Coverage under this extension w ould apply, for example, under t he following circumstances. A new 
employee is permanently denied healthcare coverage under his or  her employer’s plan, due to a 
preexisting condition. However, after 12 months, per HIPAA, the  employer is no longer permitted to 
exclude the employee and must begin offering coverage. If the e mployee brings a lawsuit as a result of 
the coverage denial, this insuring agreement would defend and i ndemnify the insured employer. 
   
64 502(c) Penalties Coverage 
Section 502(c) of ERISA states that administrators of employee benefits plans are r equired to furnish 
employee participants with infor mation about the plans. Accordi ng to ERISA: 
The administrator shall, upon written request of any participan t or beneficiary, furnish a copy of 
the latest updated summary, plan description, and the latest an nual report, any terminal report, the 
bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instr uments under which the plan is 
established or operated. 
If, for example, an employee re quested such documents, as they pertained to his or her employer’s 401(k) 
plan, and the employer refused to comply with his or her reques t, the employer would be subject to 
penalties as specified by Section 502(c) of ERISA. This coverag e extension applies to such penalties.  
Coverage for Investigations by Various Government Agencies 
This coverage extension applies when government agencies that o versee employee benefits programs 
notify an insured that the agency  seeks to undertake an investi gation of its benefit programs. (Note: some 
policies refer to coverage for i nvestigations as coverage for “ Interviews.”) For example, the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBG C) may suspect that a particul ar corporation’s defined benefit pension 
plan is seriously underfunded. Based on this perception, the PB GC notifies the corporation that it wants to 
audit the company’s pension plan. In this situation, the compan y will likely hire outside counsel to 
represent it, along with accountan ts, actuaries, and consultant s to work with PBGC auditors. The costs of 
hiring these various experts will fall within the scope of this  coverage extension. 
Covered Persons and Covered  Organizations: A Summary 
Fiduciary liability polici es cover the following. 
1. The assets of the named i nsured organization 
2. The assets of the benefit plan s scheduled in the policy 
3. The personal assets of the individuals serving as fiduciaries o f the insured’s firm 
4. The personal assets of any additi onal persons named on the poli cy

66 Answers to Chapter 7 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. ERIS A transformed the liability assoc iated with benefit plan 
management into a personal rather than a corporate obligation. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The fiduciary may be held personally liable. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Fiduc iary liability insurance will de fend the fiduciary; ERISA does not 
require the plan to do so. 
D. That’s correct! Under ERISA, the personal assets of a fiduciary  can be confiscated  to restore any 
losses suffered by a covered plan  if the losses were caused by the fiduciary’s negligence. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. It cov ers more than administrative du ties. 
B. That’s correct! The coverage provided under the policies’ fiduc iary liability insuring agreement 
applies to liability in conjuncti on with (1) fiduciary (i.e., d iscretionary) duties and (2) 
administrative (i.e., nondiscretionary) duties. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The po licy covers discretionary funct ions and more. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Covere d acts/services apply to breach  of duties with resp ect to plans that 
are and are not subject to ERISA. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Coverage  is not limited to the sponso ring organization. 
B. That’s correct! Fiduciary liabi lity policies cover the corporat ion sponsoring the benefit programs 
and the individual fiduciaries ’ liability for the acts, errors,  and omissions of third-party/outside

4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Th ere is no such time limit. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The settlement amount will not be kno wn until the litigating parties reach 
agreement. 
C. That’s correct! To be eligible t o receive coverage under this i nsuring agreement, the insured must 
first notify the insurer of the f act that a dispute is being su bmitted to a voluntary settlement. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The limit is generally $100,000. 
   
67 5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Sectio n 502(c) deals with an employer ’s failure to provide plan 
information to employee participants. 
B. This answer is incorrect. This coverage extension applies when government agencies that oversee 
employee benefits programs notify an insured that the agency se eks to undertake an investigation 
of its benefit programs. 
C. That’s correct! After 12 months, per HIPAA, an employer is no l onger permitted to exclude an

68 Chapter 8 
Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage: Coverage for “Status Changes” of Covered Organizations and Plans 
Overview 
This chapter explains how fiducia ry liability insurance applies  when covered organi zations and covered 
plans undergo various types of “status changes.” Such changes a re of particular importance within the 
context of fiduciary liability insurance. This is because claim s frequently arise when one company 
acquires another and, as a result, the acquiring company takes over the administration of the acquired 
company’s pension and benefit programs. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the types of status change that can affect fiduciary liability coverage, and 
 given relevant information, deter mine how or whether coverage a pplies to the organizations 
involved in a status change. 
Coverage for an Insured’s Ac quisition of New Benefit Plans 
The policies provide automatic c overage of additional pension a nd benefit plans over which insured 
fiduciaries obtain control when they acquire other companies. F or example, if Company A acquires 
Company B and, as a result, becom es trustee of Company B’s pens ion and benefit pl ans, Company A’s 
policy will cover acts associated  with the management and admin istration of B’s plans, beginning on the 
date such plans were acquired. 
Automatic coverage means (1) cove rage immediately applies to th e newly acquired plans, even without 
notification to the insurer, a nd (2) such coverage applies with out payment of additional premium. When 
automatic coverage does not apply, the insurer requires notific ation of the acquired plan(s), which are 
then subject to the standard underwriting process, normally req uiring additional premium. 
Limitations on Coverage of Newly Acquired Plans 
Despite the use of terminology indicating that coverage is “aut omatic,” insurers place various limits on 
the actual extent of the coverage they will provide under these  circumstances. Three key points should be 
kept in mind. 
Automatic Coverage Applies Only  If Assets of Acquired Firm Are “Limited” 
First, the policies state that insurers will automatically exte nd coverage only in situa tions where the total 
assets of the company being acquired do not exceed a specific t hreshold percentage, relative to those held 
by the acquiring company. This acquisition threshold generally ranges from 10–25 percent, depending on 
the particular insurer’s form.  
69 For instance, assume a company with assets of $100 million acqu ires another company whose assets are 
$25 million. If the asset threshold of the acquiring company’s fiduciary liability policy is 25 percent, 
automatic coverage would apply . However, if this acquisition th reshold were only 10 percent, automatic 
coverage would not apply. Thus, as this example illustrates, fr om the insured’s standpoint, the higher the 
acquisition threshold specified in a policy, the better. 
The intent behind the granting of  automatic coverage is that th e addition of such plans, given their 
relatively small size compared to the parent company (as measur ed by the asset test), will not 
substantially increase the unde rwriter’s exposure to loss. 
Coverage Is Not Automatic When  the Asset Threshold Is Exceeded 
Second, when the acquired entity’s assets exceed the threshold percentage stated in t he policy, automatic 
coverage does not apply immediate ly. Rather, coverage for the n ewly acquired entity’s plans must be 
underwritten separately, and add itional premium will usually be  charged. 
Coverage Applies Only to Act s Following Acquisition 
Third, coverage for claims associ ated with acquired plans (whet her obtained on an automatic basis or on 
the basis of separate negotiation), applies only to those claim s that were caused by acts taking place after 
the acquisition. This is illu strated in Exhibit 8.1. 
Exhibit 8.1  
Application of Coverage Following an Acquisition  
 
Company A acquires Company B on 1/1/20. On that date, Company B  is added as an insured on 
Company A’s fiduciary liability po licy. On 7/1/20, a claim is m ade against Company B in conjunction 
with a wrongful act that Company  B allegedly committed on 1/1/1 9. In this situation, no coverage for the 
claim will be available under Co mpany A’s policy . This is becau se the wrongful act that gave rise to the 
claim took place prior to the 7/ 1/20 acquisition date. Had the act taken place on or after that date, 
coverage would have been available. 
Under certain circumstances, cov erage for prior acts (such as t he wrongful act Company B allegedly 
committed on 1/1/19) c an be obtained, alt hough the underwriter will almost always require additional 
premium. Details on this action are provided later in this cour se. 
Coverage for Other Types of “Status” Changes 
Four other common types of “status changes” are relevant to the  coverage provided under fiduciary 
liability policies. These include the following. 
 Takeover of the insured and its plan(s) 
 Cessation of a subsidiary 
 Termination of a plan opera ted by the named insured 
 Newly created plans 
  
 
70 Takeover of Insured and Its Plans 
When an insured company is acquired by another company, its ben efit plan(s) is/are usually incorporated 
within the acquiring company’s existing plans. Under these circ umstances, the acquired company’s 
fiduciary coverage continues until the end of the acquired comp any’s policy term. However, coverage 
applies only for wrongful acts that took place prior to the acq uisition date. No coverage applies to 
wrongful acts that take place after the acquisition date. 
For example, assume Company A h as a fiduciary liability policy with a January 1, 2020, to January 1, 
2021, term. On July 1, 2020, Company B acquires Company A. Acco rding to the terms of the acquisition 
agreement, Company A’s benefit plans are incorporated into Comp any B’s plans. Coverage under 
Company A’s policy continues until January 1, 2021. Thus, Compa ny A will be covered for any claims 
caused by wrongful acts that took place prior to July 1, 2020 ( the date of the acquisition), provided the 
claim is made against A on or before January 1, 2021. However, Company A has no coverage for 
wrongful acts under the policy that was in effect on the date i t was acquired for any claims resulting from 
wrongful acts taking place after July 1, 2020—the date it was a cquired. 
If, for example, one of the trustees of A’s pension plan was ac cused of embezzling from the plan prior to 
July 1, 2020, coverage would apply under A’s policy, provided t he claim was made on or before  January 
1, 2021, the termination date of A’s policy. 
Conversely, if the allege d embezzlement took place after  July 1, 2020, no coverage would apply under 
A’s policy, regardless of the fact that the claim was made agai nst A prior to the expiration of its policy on 
January 1, 2021. 
The rationale behind this provision is that once the entity has  been acquired, the acquiring company’s 
fiduciary liability policy will provide coverage for wrongful a cts that took place after the acquisition date. 
And since coverage will apply (under the acquired company’s pol icy) to acts that took place prior to the 
acquisition, in theory, there should be no coverage gaps. 
Cessation of a Subsidiary (and Its Plans) 
Often, the subsidiary of a comp any will be “spun off,” meaning that another entity acquires the 
subsidiary, or, as frequently ha ppens, the parent company’s ope rating managers will purchase the 
subsidiary. Under these circumstances, the question arises as t o how coverage applies to the now former 
subsidiary’s plans. The general r ule is that coverage applies u nder the former parent company’s fiduciary 
liability policy for any acts that  (1) took place prior to the spin-off and (2) are made against the insured 
prior to the expiration of the p arent’s current fiduciary liabi lity policy. Conversely, coverage will apply 
under the new owners’ policy for any acts that took place after  the date the subsidiary was acquired/spun 
off. 
Consider the following illustra tion. On July 1, 2020, a subsidi ary of the XYZ Corporation is spun off 
when its operating managers pur chase it. The XYZ Corporation ha s a fiduciary liability policy in place 
with a January 1, 2020–21, term . In this situation, coverage wi ll apply under XYZ’s fiduciary liability 
policy to any acts associated with the subsidiary’s benefit pla ns that took place prior to July 1, 2020, 
provided the claim associated with those acts is made before th e expiration of XYZ’s policy on January 1, 
2021. Coverage for acts that took place after the July 1, 2020,  acquisition date will be covered under the 
fiduciary liability policy purch ased by the operating managers that bought the subsidiary, even if the 
claim is made prior to the expi ration of XYZ’s policy on Januar y 1, 2021. 
Termination of a Plan Operated by an Insured 
If, during the term of a fiducia ry liability policy, an insured  terminates a benefit plan, coverage applies to 
acts associated with the plan, p rovided these acts take place p rior to policy expiration. For example, 
assume an insured is covered by a  fiduciary liability policy wi th a January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021,  
71 term. One of the insured’s benef it plans is terminated on July 1, 2020. Coverage appli es to acts associated 
with the terminated plan, provided these acts took place prior to January 1, 2021, and the claim associated 
with such acts is also made against the insured prior to the ex piration of the policy on January 1, 2021. 
Coverage When a Subsidiary Is “Spun Off” versus Coverage for When a Plan Is 
Terminated 
There is a subtle but important  difference in how coverage appl ies when a subsidiary is “spun off” 
compared to how coverage applies when a plan is terminated. In the latter instance, coverage applies to 
claims made in conjunction with wrongful acts that take place u p until the policy expires, if the claim is 
made against the insured prior t o policy expiration. In the for mer case, coverage appli es to claims made in 
conjunction with wrongful acts that take place prior to the dat e on which the subsidiary is spun off, 
provided the claim is made against the insured prior to policy expiration. Following are two examples 
illustrating this distinction. 
 Subsidiary Spin-Off.  The applicable policy is writte n with a January  1, 2022–23, te rm. The 
subsidiary is spun off on July 1 , 2022. Coverage applies if (1)  the wrongful act causing the claim 
took place prior to July 1, 2022, a nd (2) the claim is made aga inst the insured prior to January 1, 
2023. 
 Plan Termination.  The applicable policy is writte n with a January 1, 2022–23, te rm. The plan is 
terminated on July 1, 2022. Cove rage applies if (1) the wrongfu l act causing the claim took place 
prior to January 1, 2023, and (2)  the claim is made against the  insured prior to January 1, 2023. 
The rationale for this difference is that when a subsidiary is spun off, the former parent company no 
longer has any control over the organization’s operations—inclu ding its benefit programs. In contrast, 
when a plan is terminated, the p arent company maintains such co ntrol. Accordingly, coverage still applies 
to acts that take place after a plan is discontinued. In contra st, coverage ceases for any acts that take place 
after a subsidiary is spun off.

74 Answers to Chapter 8 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Coverage applies only to acts taking place after the acquisition. 
B. This answer is incorrect. An a dditional premium will be charged . 
C. This answer is incorrect. When  the acquired entity’s assets exc eed the threshold percentage stated 
in the policy, automatic coverage does not apply. 
D. That’s correct! Because Pailing’ s assets exceed the 10 percent threshold, automatic coverage does 
not apply; Pailing’s plan will be  underwritten separately, and an additional premium is probable. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. It is important to also consider the date of the alleged wrongful act. 
B. This answer is incorrect. It is important to also consider the date of the alleged wrongful act. 
C. This answer is incorr ect. The wrongful act  occurred before Whal e acquired Jonah. 
D. That’s correct! No coverage for this claim is available under W hale’s policy because the wrongful 
act that gave rise to the claim occurred before the 6/1/16 acqu isition date. 
3.  
A. That’s correct! Coverage applies under the former parent compan y’s fiduciary liability policy for 
any acts that took place pr ior to the spin-off. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Bobbin ’s policy will not cover acts t hat took place befo re the spin-off. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Bobbin  was not a separate entity on F ebruary 14, when the incident 
occurred. 
D. This answer is inco rrect. Generally, coverage applies under the  former parent company’s policy 
for acts that took place before the spin-off. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Covered claims may still be made afte r July 1, 2018. 
B. That’s correct! The general rule  is that coverage applies under  the former parent company’s 
fiduciary liability po licy for any acts that  (1) took place pri or to the spin-off and (2) are made 
against the insured prior to the  expiration of the parent’s cur rent fiduciary liability policy. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Acts t aking place after January 1, 20 18, can also be covered. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The subsidiary was acquired before Ja nuary 1, 2019. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Covera ge applies to acts taking place  after July 1, 2018. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Covera ge applies to acts taking place  during the policy period. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Acts t aking place after January 1, 20 18, can also be covered. 
D. That’s correct! If, during the t erm of a fiduciary liability po licy, an insured terminates a benefit 
plan, coverage applies to acts associated with the plan, provid ed these acts take place prior to 
policy expiration.

Key Definitions in Fiduciary Liability Policies 
Overview 
This chapter explains how fiduc iary liability policy forms defi ne the following key terms: covered losses, 
claim, and defense costs. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the correct definition of the following terms: 
o covered losses, 
o claims, and 
o defense costs; and 
 apply the foregoing definitions in identifying the insurer’s ob ligations in a given situation. 
Covered Losses 
Fiduciary liability policies cove r indemnity payments (i.e., co mpensatory awards and settlement costs) 
and defense expenses that result from claims made against insur eds. In addition, the policies cover 
supplementary expenses associated  with litigation, including bo nds and appeal costs. 
Certain or Limited Fines, Civil Penalties, Taxes, Unin surable Matters, Benefits 
Payable under Plans 
On the other hand, fines, civil penalties, taxes, any matter de emed uninsurable by la w, and actual benefits 
payable under the insured plans are excluded by most policies’ definitions of “loss.” However, some of 
the policies do cover (subject to sublimits) fines and penaltie s levied in conjunction with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. T he rationale for affo rding such coverage 
is that the HIPAA law falls within the scope of the Employee Re tirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 
of 1974. In addition, some polic ies include penalties levied un der Section 502(c) of ERISA within their 
definitions of covered loss. (No te that other policies contain specific coverage extensions for HIPAA and 
Section 502(i) penalties, rather than including such items with in their definitions of covered loss.) 
Punitive Damages 
Nearly all fiduciary insurers c over punitive damages—that is, d amages that intend to punish the 
wrongdoer rather than compensate the person or organization suf fering the loss. (Note, however, that not 
all states permit insurance cove rage of punitive damage awards. ) Such coverage is achieved by means of 
most favorable jurisdiction wording.  
76 Definition of “Claim” 
The manner in which the policies define the term “claim” is an important coverage issue. The broadest 
possible definition is ideal b ecause it tends to accelerate the  trigger of coverage under a fiduciary liability 
policy form, which is usually adva ntageous from the insured’s s tandpoint. Although the exact definition 
of “claim” varies from policy to  policy, the following are even ts that trigger a claim under the typical 
fiduciary liability form. 
Written Demand for Monetary  or Nonmonetary Relief 
Under nearly all fiduciary liab ility policies, a written, rathe r than an oral, demand is required to trigger 
coverage. Such demands can seek  either money damages or nonmone tary relief (e.g., a cease and desist 
order). 
Civil Proceeding Commenced by the Service of a Complaint 
A civil proceeding commenced by th e service of a complaint is a ctually a type of written demand for 
monetary or nonmonetary relief. 
Criminal Proceeding Commenced by Filing of Charges 
A criminal indictment also tri ggers coverage under a fiduciary liability policy. This is important because, 
at times, fiduciaries are indicted for criminal offenses, prior  to the time in which civil complaints are filed 
against them. For example, the trustee of a pension plan could be indicted for embezzlement before being 
sued in civil court. 
The policies exclude coverage f or damages alleged in conjunctio n with criminal acts. However, they state 
that defense coverage is provide d when an insured is criminally  charged and that defense coverage 
continues until “final adjudication,” meaning the point at whic h the insured fiduciary is acquitted or 
convicted or the claim is settled. 
Formal Investigative Proceeding 
Regulatory entities, such as the Department of Labor and the Pe nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
(PBGC), sometimes request inves tigations into various benefit p rograms operated by a corporation, such 
as when a pension plan appears to be seriously underfunded. Thu s, it is important for coverage to be 
triggered by such actions. 
Formal Administrative or Regulatory Proceeding 
This includes the filing of a notice of charges against an insu red, which alleges violation of ERISA. 
Arbitration, Mediation,  or Alternative Dispute Resolution Proceeding 
Under the terms of most fiduciary  liability policies, when an i nsured is requested to appear at an 
arbitration hearing, coverage is automatically triggered. This is beneficial because pension and benefit 
plan-related disputes are increasingly being addressed by the a rbitration process rather than through the 
traditional court system. 
Written Request To Toll/Waive a Statute of Li mitations Relating to a Potential Civil 
or Administrative Proceeding 
A written request to waive or to ll (i.e., suspend) a statute of  limitations generally involves a situation 
when a government agency or a c laimant suspects wrongdoing on t he part of a fiduciary but requires 
additional investigatory time to determine the exact nature of such potential wrongdoing—prior to filing a 
claim. Often, the agency or claim ant eventually does file a for mal claim against the insured fiduciary(ies). 
Thus, when an insured is notifie d of such requests, coverage is  triggered under most policy forms.  
77 Covered Defense Costs 
In addition to covering indemnity payments (i.e., settlements a nd judgments associated with claims), 
fiduciary liability policies also  cover the costs required to i nvestigate, defend, and settle claims. These 
items typically encompass attorney fees, adjusters’ services, c ourt costs, bonds, and related expenses 
required by the claim settlement process. 
Defense within Policy Limits 
Under virtually all the insurers’ forms, payment of defense cos ts reduces the policy’s limit of liability. In 
other words, defense costs are paid within policy limits. To il lustrate: Assume that a fiduciary liability 
policy is written with a $2 m illion limit. Also assume that in defending a claim, the insurer expends $1 
million. At this juncture, $1 m illion of coverage remains to pa y any combination of additional defense 
costs, settlements, or judgments. 
Duty To Defend Provisions 
The phrase “duty to defend” in a fiduciary liability policy sta tes that the insurer has the duty to defend any 
claim alleging a covered act under the policy. In contrast, the  phrase “duty to pay” or “non-duty to 
defend” in a policy states that the insurer does not have the d uty to defend claims; rather, it is the duty of 
the insured to defend claims. Such forms only compel the insure r to pay the defense costs in connection 
with the insured’s executing the defense of the claims. 
Nearly all fiduciary liability forms contain wording to the eff ect that the insurer has a duty to defend. (A 
few insurers give insureds the option to buy coverage on a non- duty to defend basis, however.) For all but 
the largest, most legally experi enced and sophisticated corpora tions that have large internal legal staffs, 
duty to defend provisions eliminate the burden of having to sec ure appropriate legal counsel and to 
manage the claim defense process. Since most firms lack both th e knowledge and legal talent available to 
deal with such claims, requiring the insurer to select counsel and control the defense process actually 
confers a benefit and protects the insured organization. 
“All” Allegations Defense: A Key  Benefit of Duty To Defend Form s 
Another significant benefit for insureds of duty to defend poli cies is that under these forms, the insurer is 
obligated to defend all the allegations in a lawsuit, as long a s the policy covers at least one such 
allegation. 
The following scenario illustrat es this point. A newly hired em ployee properly filled out the enrollment 
form for coverage under the comp any’s medical insurance plan, b ut the human resources assistant 
misplaced the application and never mailed it to the insurance company. As a result, the employee had no 
insurance coverage when he was diagnosed with cancer 1 month la ter. The employee complained so 
bitterly and so frequently upon l earning he had no coverage tha t the company terminated him. The now 
ex-employee then sued for damages relating to the error in admi nistering the company’s healthcare plan 
and for lost wages resulting from wrongful termination. 
Although damages arising from the first allegation—the error in  administering employee benefits—is 
clearly covered by standard fiduc iary liability policy forms, t he wrongful termination claim is not. 
However, since coverage exists fo r the first allegation, an ins urer, under a “duty to defend” policy, must 
also defend the wrongful termination claim (although it would n ot be liable for any potential damages). In 
contrast, under a fiduciary liability policy written on a “non- duty to defend” basis, the insurer would only 
be obligated to defend (and pay ) the claim associated with the first allegation but would have no 
obligation to defend the wrongful termination claim.

80 Answers to Chapter 9 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Most policies’ “loss” definitions exc lude civil penalties. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Fines are never treated as losses. 
C. That’s correct! Fines, civil pe nalties, taxes, any matter deeme d uninsurable by law, and actual 
benefits payable under the insure d plans are excluded by most p olicies’ definitions of “loss.” The 
policy is designed primarily to cover indemnity payments and de fense costs. 
D. This answer is incorrect. “Loss” is not defined to include taxe s in most policies. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. To trigger coverage, Dora should put it in writing. 
B. That’s correct! Nearly all fiduc iary liability policies are tri ggered by a written demand seeking 
either money damages or nonmoneta ry relief such as a cease and desist order. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Near ly all fiduciary liability polici es require a written demand to trigger 
coverage. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Marla has not made a demand for money  or other relief. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Fines are not covered. 
B. That’s correct! Fiduciary liabi lity policies provide defense co verage when an insured is criminally 
charged. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Coverage  is not limited to these two costs. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The in surer will also be involved in the criminal case. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Payment of any settlement does not re duce the limits available to cover 
defense costs. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Because defense costs are within limi ts, nearly all policies’ limits apply 
to both defense costs and indemnity payments. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Defe nse costs are within limits. 
D. That’s correct! In addition to covering indemnity payments (i.e ., settlements and judgments 
associated with claims), fiduciary liability policies cover the  costs required to investigate, defend, 
and settle claims. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The in surer has a duty to defend the wrongful termination claim. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The in surer has a duty to defend the administrative error claim. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The fiduciary liability policy does n ot cover damages  for wrongful 
termination; that’s the province of employment practices liabil ity coverage.

Fiduciary Liability Coverage: Limits and Deductibles/Retentions Provisions 
Overview 
This chapter examines the limit s and deductibles/retentions pro visions found within fiduciary liability 
policies. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize how the limits and deduc tibles/retentions provisions in a fiduciary liability policy 
operate and 
 given relevant information con cerning a covered fiduciary liabi lity claim, determine the amount 
payable by the insurer and/or the insured. 
Policy Limits 
Under most fiduciary liability policies, a maximum aggregate li mit applies to all of the insuring 
agreements contained within the  policy. In addition, sublimits are provided for the coverage extensions 
that are included. These sublim its reduce the amount of coverag e available for all other types of claims 
and do not provide additional amounts of insurance. 
The following example illustrates the manner in which limits ar e afforded under the typical fiduciary 
liability policy. Assume the policy contains a $5 million aggre gate limit. Also assume that the policy 
contains sublimits ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 for the var ious coverage extensions the policy 
provides, such as settlor covera ge, managed care coverage, Heal th Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 199 6 claim coverage, coverage for  502(c) penalties, and coverage for 
investigations. Any monies paid out under these coverage extens ions will reduce the $5 million aggregate 
limit. In addition, voluntary com pliance settlement coverage is  also usually written with a sublimit. 
Coverage for fiduciary liability claims is available up to a ma ximum of $5 million, an amount that could 
be reduced if monies are paid out  under any of the aforemention ed coverage extensions the policy also 
provides. 
Interrelated Claims Provisions 
Interrelated claims provisions state that if a series of claims  results from a single wrongful act or a series 
of related wrongful acts, errors , or omissions and these claims  are made during more than one policy 
period, the applicable limit of c overage is the one that was in  effect at the time the first claim was made. 
   
82 Application of the Interr elated Claims Provision 
Assume that in 2020, Company A’s pension plan is merged with Co mpany B’s plan, after Company B 
acquires Company A. The trustees of A’s plan are later sued bec ause the benefits under B’s plan are 
lower than under Company A’s pla n. Fiduciary liability policies  with limits of $5 million were in force 
during 2021, 2022, and 2023. Three different beneficiaries make  claims against the trustees in 2021, 
2022, and 2023, respectively. 
Under an interrelated claims p rovision, the $5 million policy l imit applying in 2021 represents the total 
limit available to pay and defend all three claims—regardless o f the fact that claims were also made 
against the fiduciaries during the 2022 and 2023 policy years. 
Purpose of the Interrelated Claims Provision 
The purpose of interrelated claims provisions is to prevent a “ pyramiding” or “stacking” of limits in 
which policy limits from more tha n 1 year are applied to a sing le wrongful act or series of related 
wrongful acts. 
In the absence of such a provision, 
 the insurer’s $5 million policy limit applicable during 2021 wo uld have applied to the first claim; 
 the insurer’s $5 million policy limits applicable during 2022 w ould have applied to the second 
claim; and 
 the insurer’s $5 million limit app licable during 2023 would hav e applied to the third claim. 
Thus, despite the fact that all three claims arose from a singl e act—the merger of the two companies’ 
pension plans—in the absence of t he interrelated claims provisi on, the insurer would have been 
responsible for paying as much as $5 million under each  of three policies, or a total of $15 million. 
Interrelated claims provisions a re especially important in fidu ciary liability policies because claims 
involving essentially the same wrongful act are often filed by multiple claimants during different policy 
terms. 
Deductibles/Retentions 
Most fiduciary liability polici es include clauses in their dedu ctible/retention provisions stating that the 
policy deductible/retention applies per wrongful act rather tha n to each separate claim. For example, in 
the scenario noted previously, illustrating application of inte rrelated claims provisions, only one 
deductible/retention w ould apply because all three of the claim s arose from a single wrongful act. 
The “batch clause” (another term for a per wrongful act deducti ble/retention) is especially important in 
fiduciary liability insurance b ecause, if there were no such pr ovision, the application of a separate 
deductible/retention to each clai mant would dramatically reduce  the extent of coverage provided by the 
policy, given the fact that many claims against fiduciaries are  filed as class actions, which always involve 
multiple plaintiffs. 
Application of Deductibles/Rete ntions to Defense Coverage 
Fiduciary liability de ductible/retention clauses normally state  that the deductible/retention applies to both 
indemnity payments and defense costs, regardless of whether an indemnity payment is made. In effect, 
the forms do not provide “first dollar” defense coverage. 
To illustrate, assume that an ins urer expends $50,000 to defend  a fiduciary but is not ultimately required 
to pay a judgment or settlement  on the fiduciary’s behalf becau se the claim is dismissed on a summary 
judgment basis. If the policy contains a $50,000 deductible/ret ention, the insurer would seek 
reimbursement from the insured in the amount of $50,000 to sati sfy the policy’s deductible/retention 
provision, regardless of the fact that no indemnity payments we re made on the insured’s behalf.  
83 Alternatively, if, in this scenario, in addition to expending $ 50,000 in defense costs, the insured settled the 
claim for $200,000, the $50,000 deductible would still apply an d the insurer would pay $200,000 (with 
the insured absorbing the $50,000 deductible). 
The policies are written so that a separate retention, usually noted on the policy’s declarations page, 
applies to each insuring agree ment and coverage extension.

86 Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The insurer did not pay $40,000 under  a coverage with a $25,000 
sublimit. Remember, defense costs are within limits. 
B. That’s correct! Because of the managed care sublimit, the insur er paid $25,000 on the first claim 
for both indemnity and defense costs. Therefore, only $975,000 ($1 million – $25,000) remains 
available for both indemnity and  defense costs resulting from t he fiduciary liability claim. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The in surer has already paid damages under the managed care claim. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Payment of the previous managed care claim has eroded the $1 million 
limit, reducing the remaining limits still available. 
2.  
A. That’s correct! The interrelated  claims provisions apply when a  series of claims from a single 
wrongful act or a series of act s, errors, or omissions are made  during more than one policy period. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The pr ovisions do not specifically ap ply to pyramid schemes. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Although increases are probably more common than decr eases, the limits 
in a series of policies may incr ease or decrease from one year to the next. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. The effect of th e interrelated claims  provision is to e liminate stacking. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The interrelated claims provision doe s not specify that the applicable 
limit is the one in effect whe n the error first occurred. 
B. That’s correct! The applicable l imit is the one that was in eff ect at the time the first claim is made. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The interrelated claims provision spe cifies that one particular policy’s 
limit is the one that applies. 
D. This answer is incorrect. No wrongful acts were allegedly commi tted during Year 5. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The provision is intended to prevent applying limits from more than one 
policy. 
B. This answer is incorrect. If thi s were true, it would defeat th e purpose of aggregate limits. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The provisions apply to a single act or a series of relat ed wrongful acts. 
D. That’s correct! The purpose of i nterrelated claims provisions i s to prevent a “pyramiding” or 
“stacking” of limits in which policy limits from more than one year are applied to a single 
wrongful act or series of related wrongful acts. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The insurer would pay nothing for dam ages if the claim were settled in 
the insured’s favor, but t hat’s not the case here. 
B. This answer is incorr ect. The $50,000 deductible will be paid b y the insured, not the insurer. 
C. This answer is incorrect. This would be the amount payable by t he insured if the insured had to 
pay its own defense costs, but that is not the case. 
D. That’s correct! In this claim, the indemnity payment is $150,00 0, plus $25,000 was expended in 
defense, for a total of $175,000. The insured must then reimbur se the insurer for the $50,000 
deductible. This results in a ne t payment of $125,000 by the in surer ($175,000 – $50,000 = 
$125,000).

Fiduciary Liability Policy Conditions 
Overview 
The conditions sections of fiduciary liability insurance polici es significantly affect the insureds’ rights 
under the policies. This chapter discusses three policy conditi ons that are especially important in fiduciary 
liability policies. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the effect of each of the following conditions found in fiduciary liability policies: 
o subrogation/recourse, 
o severability of interests provisions, and 
o managed care exception wording; and 
 given relevant claim informati on, recognize how each of the for egoing conditions would apply. 
Subrogation/Recourse 
One unusual aspect of the subrogation provisions within fiducia ry liability policies is that, unless 
specified, underwriters ordinarily have what is known as the ri ght of recourse—that is, the right to 
subrogate against an insured. 
Subrogation is the assignment, to an insurer, by terms of the p olicy or by law, after payment of a loss, of 
the rights of the insured to recover the amount of the loss fro m one legally liable for it. Thus, under a 
subrogation provision, an insurer could have the right to colle ct the amount of its payment to a beneficiary 
under a pension plan, from the fiduciary whose negligence cause d the beneficiary to suffer a loss. 
Such a procedure represents a dis tinct departure from the appro ach used in most other types of 
management and professional liabilit y insurance, wherein policy  language typically bars subrogation 
against insureds. 
When Is Subrogation Permitted Against Fiduciaries? 
Section 410(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Ac t (ERISA) of 1974 allows an insurer to 
pursue subrogation against a covered fiduciary, if the premium for a fiduciary policy is paid out of a 
benefit plan’s assets. The logic underlying this  provision is t hat fiduciaries should not be financially 
absolved from the consequences of  their wrongful acts when prem iums for liability coverage are being 
paid from the assets of the benef it plans they are administerin g—to the detriment of the beneficiaries of 
those plans. 
Subrogation/Recourse: An Example 
The fiduciaries managing a company’s employee benefit plans are  sued because they hired an 
incompetent actuary whose recomme ndations produced a woefully u nderfunded defined benefit pension 
plan. Premiums for the corpora tion’s fiduciary liability policy  were paid out of the pension plan’s assets.  
88 In this instance, the insurer has the right to subrogate (known  as the right of recourse, as described above) 
against the insured fiduciaries. 
The rationale for allowing subrogation (which, as noted above, is unusual under management and 
professional liability policy form s) is that since coverage for  the fiduciary liability policy is being paid for 
from the beneficiaries’ assets (i.e., the pension fund), the fi duciaries should not have the benefit of 
insurance coverage under these ci rcumstances and that, as a res ult, the insurer has a right to be reimbursed 
for paying the loss, from the fiduciaries who caused the loss. 
Why Subrogation/Recourse Is Rarel y Pursued Against Fiduciaries 
It should be recognized, however, that in actual practice, subr ogation/recourse is rarely pursued against 
fiduciaries. This is because near ly all corporate organizations  pay fiduciary liability premiums as a 
corporate expense ( and not from benefit plan assets). As a result, the fiduciaries are no t using the benefit 
plan beneficiaries’ assets to pro vide liability coverage for th emselves. Rather, they are using their own 
assets (or, in this instance, t he corporation’s assets, on whos e behalf they are administering the benefit 
plans) to protect themselves from liability claims made against  them. 
“Waiver of Recourse” Provisions 
Given the foregoing, nearly all fiduciary liability policies’ r ecourse/subrogation provisions state that the 
insurer will “waive its right of recourse” against insured fidu ciaries in the event that policy premiums are 
paid from corporate proceeds—rather than from benefit plan asse ts—which is almost always the case. 
Severability 
Provisions that enforce the con cept of severability of coverage  are included in virtually all fiduciary 
liability policies. These clauses state that coverage applies separately  to each insured under the policy. 
There are three significant im plications of such clauses: 
 Actions of one insured do not void coverage as to other insured s. 
 False statements within the appli cation for coverage made by on e insured will not be imputed to 
other insureds and will therefore not bar coverage as to other insureds. 
 Policy limits do not increase based on the number of insured fi duciaries. 
These three concepts a re discussed below. 
Actions of One Insured Do Not Void Coverage as to Other Insureds 
First, severability provisions indicate that if the actions of one (or more) insured(s ) void coverage under 
the policy, such coverage is not  invalidated as respects other individuals insured by the policy. This type 
of severability provision is also contained within certain excl usions found in fiduciary liability policies, 
typically in the dishonesty and personal profit exclusions, whi ch are discussed in Chapter 12. 
Here is an example in which a severability provision would appl y. Assume that one fiduciary commits an 
act that would be subject to the policy’s dishonesty exclusion (e.g., a benefit plan trustee profits when, in 
return for a kickback, he allows h is brother-in-law to manage t he assets of a covered plan). Further, 
assume that as a result of this action, all fiduciaries insured  by the policy are named in a lawsuit. In this 
situation, the severability provi sion of the policy will provid e defense coverage for the other “innocent” 
fiduciaries—despite the fact tha t no coverage would be availabl e to the culpable individual who 
committed the dishonest act of receiving a kickback. 
Severability provisions are also sometimes referred to as nonim putation clauses, meaning that the 
wrongful act of one insured (whic h bars coverage for that perso n) will not be “imputed” to another 
person, so as to bar coverage f or the innocent insured(s).  
89 False Statements in Applications Do No t Void Coverage as to Other Insureds 
The second common situation in w hich severability provisions ap ply is when one (or more) individual(s) 
intentionally provides false information on an application for fiduciary coverage. In  a claim situation 
involving the false statement, the severability provision voids  coverage only for the specific insured 
person(s) who provided such fal se information. Consequently, th e policy would cover those insureds who 
were not aware of and were not a party to the false statement m ade on the application. 
Consider the following example. T he president of an insured cor poration, who also served as a trustee of 
the firm’s benefit programs, si gned an application for fiduciar y coverage, which he knew vastly 
overstated the assets of the compa ny’s defined benefit pension plans while understating its future 
liabilities to beneficiaries. If a ll the company’s fiduciaries are later sued in connection with that plan, 
coverage would only be voided as to the president who signed th e application, but coverage would be 
available as to the other fiducia ries who were not aware of the  false data to which the president had 
attested. 
Policy Limits Do Not Increase Based on the Number of Insured Fiduciaries 
The third effect of severability provisions is to clarify the f act that although coverage can apply separately 
to individual fiduciaries, sever ability does not increase the p olicy’s basic limit of liability. 
For example, under a fiduciary liability policy containing a $1 0 million annual aggregate limit, a 
maximum of $10 million would be a vailable to defend and pay on behalf of all insured fiduciaries during 
the policy term. This $10 million limit would apply and not inc rease—regardless of how many individual 
fiduciaries were actually named in a single lawsuit. 
The first two types of severab ility provisions discussed above are beneficial to insureds, while the third 
protects the insurer. 
Order of Payments 
About half of all fiduciary liability policies contain order of  payments provisions, also known as priority 
of payments provisions. 
These provisions state that in the  event of a loss for which th e insurer is liable for making a payment, such 
payment will be made in the following order. First, loss will b e paid on behalf of the insured persons  
under the policy. Next, loss will be paid on behalf of insured plans  within the policy. Lastly, loss will be 
paid on behalf of the insured company  under the policy. 
Directors and officers liability policies contain a similar pro vision, whereby payment priorities begin with 
the individual directors and officers (Coverage A), followed by  the insured corpora tion (Coverage B), and 
lastly coverage for securities lia bility claims (Coverage C).

Fiduciary Liability Policy Exclusions 
Overview 
Exclusions contained in fiduciary liability policy forms, which  can have a significant effect on the scope 
of coverage they provide, are t he subject of this chapter. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 recognize the purpose and the effect of each of the following e xclusions contained in a fiduciary 
liability policy: 
o dishonesty; 
o personal profit; 
o contractual liability; 
o failure to collect contributions (owed to an employee benefit p lan); 
o claims from a subsidiary prior to acquisition; 
o failure to fund in accordance with the Employee Retirement Inco me Security Act 
(ERISA) of 1974; 
o failure to purchase or maintain insurance or bonds; 
o workers compensation, unemploym ent insurance, and Social Securi ty disability benefits; 
o discrimination not related to ERISA law; 
o benefits payable to a beneficiary; 
o bodily injury and property damage; and 
o exposures excluded by other types of management and professiona l liability policies; and 
 given relevant information, recognize how each of these exclusi ons would apply in a particular 
situation. 
Dishonesty 
Insuring fiduciaries for the individual liability that arises o ut of their intentional commission of illegal 
acts is not permitted as a matter of public policy and is there fore excluded. However, nearly all fiduciary 
liability policies qualify the dishonesty exclusion by stating that it applies only if a “judgment” or “final 
adjudication” establishes that the insured committed the intent ionally dishonest act. 
In addition, since an insurer’s duty to defend is generally con strued as being broader than its duty to 
indemnify, insurers typically provide defense coverage to alleg ations of fraud or criminal acts until such 
dishonest acts are actually proven by means of a criminal convi ction or an adverse civil judgment.  
95 Another important aspect of the dishonesty exclusion is that it  is usually written with severability 
language. This has the effect of providing so-called innocent i nsureds with defense coverage in the event 
a claim names such individuals as defendants, in addition to on e or more culpable insureds. 
The Practical Effect of the Dishonesty Exclusion 
In actual practice, a settlement is reached between the claiman t and the insurer in the vast majority of 
cases when claims against fiduc iaries allege dishonest conduct.  Within the settlement agreement, the 
insured rarely makes an admissi on of liability and the insurer then simply pays the settlement amount on 
the insured’s behalf. Consequent ly, the actual effect of the di shonesty exclusion is practically nil, because 
the exclusion is not usually enf orced in a manner that denies c overage for either defense costs or 
indemnity payments. 
Personal Profit 
Liability of fiduciaries who attain personal profit or financia l advantage to which they were not legally 
entitled is another exposure consid ered uninsurable and therefo re excluded. For example, if a trustee of a 
defined benefit pension plan recei ves a portion of a broker’s c ommission in return for investing the plan’s 
funds with the broker’s company, a claim arising from such an a ct would fall within the policy’s personal 
profit exclusion and would thus be excluded. 
However, most fiduciary liability policies do not apply this ex clusion unless the claim of personal profit is 
factually established. This appr oach is similar to what is used  within the dishonesty exclusion, whereby 
application of the exclusion is contingent upon “final adjudica tion.” 
Contractual Liability 
Fiduciary liability policies typi cally contain an exclusion tha t precludes coverage for situations in which a 
fiduciary is required to hold a third party harmless for the th ird party’s negligent act, error, or omission in 
conjunction with services that the third party is providing to a benefit plan. 
An Example: Holding a Third Party Harml ess in Conjunction with a Benefit Plan 
A Certified Public Accountant (CPA ) firm requests that an insur ed fiduciary hold the accounting firm 
harmless if the firm is sued in connection with auditing servic es the accounting firm performs for the 
plan. Also assume that the accounting firm certifies that the p lan’s financial statements have been 
prepared according to genera lly accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and fairly represent the plan’s 
true financial condition. Six months later, the plan is declare d insolvent by the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation (PBGC). The beneficiaries sue the CPA firm, which, in turn, seeks to be held harmless by the 
trustee of the plan. Given the  contractual liability exclusion,  no coverage would apply to hold the 
accounting firm harmless—that is, cover its defense costs and m ake indemnity payments on its behalf.  
Rationale for the Exclusion 
Contractual liability exclusions  eliminate coverage for hold ha rmless agreements in situations such as the 
above example for two reasons. First, outside service providers  should rightfully maintain professional 
liability coverage of their own and therefore not require clien ts to hold them harmless when they provide 
professional services. Second, insurers are averse to assuming liability for hold har mless agreements 
unless they can underwrite them at the inception of a policy—in  which case some insurers may agree to 
modify the policy’s contractua l liability exclusion so that it excepts and thus covers a specific hold 
harmless agreement.  
96 Avoid Holding Other Parties Harmless 
As a general rule, it is a sou nd practice for a fiduciary to av oid holding outside parties harmless for 
services that outside parties render in conjunction with a bene fit or pension plan. However, if an insured 
fiduciary must hold another entity harmless (which is sometimes  the case when the service provider is a 
large firm with substantial ba rgaining power), the underwriter should be advised prior to policy inception. 
This allows the insurer time to e valuate the nature of the expo sure and assess an appropriate additional 
premium if the underwriter is w illing to cover such an agreemen t. 
Important Exception Wording 
Within the contractual liability exclusion, there are usually t wo key exceptions that provide affirmative 
coverage for two types of hold ha rmless agreements: (1) an agre ement to assume liability that would have 
applied even in the absence of a contract and (2) an agreement in a trust agreement or in other documents 
establishing a corporate benefit plan that requires the trustee  to assume liability for another party’s 
negligence. These two excep tions are discussed below. 
Liability That Would Have Applied in the Absence of a Contract 
It is common for contractual liability exclusions to be worded so they provide an exception (and thereby 
provide coverage) for liability tha t would have attached even i n the absence of a contract. Assume that a 
contract with a pension actuary required an insured corporation  to indemnify and hold harmless the 
actuary for claims resulting from the insured fiduciary’s sole negligence. Also assume that the insured 
fiduciary provided the actuary with out-of-date data pertaining  to its pension plan and that, as a result, the 
pension actuary’s calculations as to the plan’s solvency turned  out to be erroneous. Under these 
conditions, even in the absence of  an agreement to hold the act uary harmless, the fiduciary would still 
have been required to indemnify t he actuary for any claims made  against the actuary. This is because such 
claims would have been the result of the fiduciary’s negligence  (not the actuary’s). In this instance, the 
policy would therefore cover th e fiduciary’s assumption of liab ility, because such lia bility (i.e., for the 
fiduciary’s sole negligence) would apply even if the fiduciary had never agreed to hold the actuary 
harmless. 
Liability Assumed in Benefit Plan Documents 
If, according to the documents governing an insured benefit pla n, an insured fiduciary is required to hold 
a benefit plan service provider, such as an investment manager,  accountant, or attorney, harmless (even if 
a claim results from the service provider’s negligence), most f iduciary liability policies contain exception 
wording stating that coverage applies under these circumstances . Underwriters are willing to cover hold 
harmless agreements of this type because such requirements are stated in plan documents, which insurers 
presumably have had an opportunity to review during the underwr iting process, prior t o binding coverage. 
Failure To Collect Contributions O wed to an Employee Benefit Pl an 
The majority of, but not all, fiduciary liability policies excl ude coverage for claims caused by a 
fiduciary’s failure to collect contributions owed to a pension or benefit plan. This exposure arises more 
often in multiemployer, union- sponsored plans and less frequent ly as respects single-employer plans. 
Rationale for the Exclusion 
The failure to collect contributions exclusion appears in fiduc iary liability policies because the collecting 
of pension and benefit plan contributions from companies partic ipating in a benefit plan is an activity that 
is within an insured’s control . Accordingly, insurers exclude t his exposure because they do not intend to 
provide what would, in effect, serve as “financial guarantee in surance.”  
97 Key Exception Wording 
However, many of the forms do provide key exception wording, by  providing coverage if it is alleged that 
failure to collect contributions was the result of the insured’ s negligence rather than the result of an 
intentional act. The rationale for this exception to the exclus ion is that an insurer will cover an insured’s 
unintentional failure to make suc h collections but not the deli berate failure to do s o. For example, if an 
insured fiduciary believed it needed to collect $500,000 in ann ual premiums from each of the 10 
participants in a multiemployer pension plan (when it actually needed to collect $750,000), coverage 
would apply because the failure  to collect contributions was th e result of the insured’s negligence in 
underestimating the required leve l of contributions rather than  an intentional failure to collect 
contributions. 
Claims from a Subsidiary Prior to Acquisition 
The policies routinely exclude c overage for claims associated w ith a subsidiary that were the result of 
wrongful acts taking place prior to the date on which the insur ed corporation acquired the subsidiary. As 
noted in Chapter 8 under “Covera ge for Other Types of ‘Status’ Changes,” claims against fiduciaries 
frequently result from such circumstances. 
Rationale for the Exclusion 
The rationale for this exclusion is that the underwriter did no t insure the subsidiary at the time of the 
wrongful act and, thus, should not  be responsible for covering claims associated with t hese types of acts. 
This exclusion is necessary because, absent such wording, claim s from a subsidiary’s preacquisition 
wrongful acts would otherwise be covered. Specifically, if such  a claim were made a gainst the insured 
during the term of the policy and the wrongful act took place o n or after the policy’s retroactive date, the 
insurer would not be able to deny liability for it. Although su ch claims can be precluded by manuscript 
exclusionary endorsements, these endorsements could become diff icult for an underwriter to manage, 
especially in the case of an insure d that frequently acquires o ther companies. Accordingly, this “blanket” 
exclusion accomplishes what a number of individual manuscript e ndorsements would otherwise be 
required to do. 
Failure To Fund in Accordance with ERISA 
Exclusions for claims alleging failure to fund in accordance wi th the ERISA law are contained in most 
fiduciary liability policies. The  rationale for the exclusion i s that covering losses is contrary to public 
policy since, under such conditio ns, the insurer would be provi ding coverage for inten tional violations of 
federal law (although providing de fense coverage to allegations  of legal violations would not be contrary 
to public policy). Accordingly, many of the forms do provide de fense coverage to allegations that the 
insured(s) failed to fund in accordance with ERISA. 
Failure To Purchase or Main tain Insurance or Bonds 
As noted earlier in this course, ERISA requires that employee d ishonesty coverage be arranged to protect 
the assets of an insured organization’s pension and welfare pla ns. Claims arising from the insured’s 
failure to purchase such coverag e are uninsurable because avoid ance of claims arising from this failure is 
within the insured’s control. 
Workers Compensation, Unemploym ent Insurance, and Social 
Security Disability Benefits 
Nearly all fiduciary liability forms preclude coverage for clai ms produced by obligations from workers 
compensation, unemployment insurance, and disability laws. The rationale for this exclusion is that other, 
more specific insurance is ava ilable to cover such liabilities (i.e., workers compensation coverage).  
98 However, some versions of this e xclusion provide an exception a nd, therefore, cover claims associated 
with Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 plans and claims made under 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  of 1996. Such plans allow employees to 
purchase an extension of their healthcare insurance coverage fo r an 18-month period following the end of 
their employment with an organiza tion. The rationale for this e xception is that separate insurance is not 
available to cover these exposur es. Additionally, and as discus sed in Chapter 7, insurers frequently 
provide affirmative coverage grant s within their policies that cover these two exposures. 
Discrimination Not Related to ERISA Law 
A number of the policies contain an exclusion for claims allegi ng discrimination that is not related to the 
ERISA law. The rationale for thi s exclusion is that fiduciary l iability policies are not intended to cover the 
types of discrimination typically addressed by employment pract ices liability (EPL) policy forms, 
including discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age, or nat ional origin under laws  such as the Equal Pay 
Act of 1963, the Age Discriminati on in Employment Act of 1967, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
Exception and Coverage for Discrimination under Benefit-Related Laws 
On the other hand, this exclus ion would not preclude coverage i f, for example, a claim ant were to allege 
that he or she was discriminated against as respects the availa bility of or eligibility to receive benefits 
under an employee benefit plan c overed by a fiduciary liability  policy. As explained earlier in this course, 
Section 510 of ERISA prevents employers from taking actions tha t might abridge or prevent an employee 
from collecting benefits or taking punitive action against a pa rticipant for exercising his or her rights 
under an employee benefit plan. A ccordingly, such claims are “e xcepted” by this exclusion and therefore 
covered by fiduciary liability policies. In effect, the purpose  of the discrimination exclusion is to preclude 
coverage for traditional employ ment-related allegations rather than claims alleging that a fiduciary’s 
benefit-related decisions and actions were discriminatory. 
Benefits Payable to a Beneficiary 
Most fiduciary liability polici es preclude coverage for payment  of benefits owed to a claimant unless such 
benefits represent a personal ob ligation of an insured fiduciar y and such claim results from a specific 
wrongful act. For example, assume an employee’s beneficiary is unable to collect a death benefit under a 
company’s term life insurance program because the insurer that provided such coverage is insolvent. The 
fiduciary liability policy will not pay such benefit unless it can be shown that one or more of the 
individual fiduciaries committed a wrongful act that caused the  survivor to be unable to collect the benefit 
due. Accordingly, if it could be demonstrated that the fiduciar y(ies) in this example knowingly purchased 
the life insurance from a financially unsound insurer and that,  soon after the purchase, the insurer was 
declared insolvent, the fiduciary liability policy would provid e coverage for the benefit due. 
Rationale for the Exclusion 
The purpose of this exclusion is to prevent the fiduciary liabi lity insurer from becoming a financial 
guarantor of benefits due under an insured corporation’s benefi t programs. Rather, c overage for benefits 
due will only apply when one or mo re of the insured fiduciaries  commits a wrongful act that prevents the 
employee or dependent from collecting a benefit that was due hi m or her (such as in the example above). 
   
99 Bodily Injury and Property Damage 
As noted in Chapter 2, in the discussion of managed care except ion wording, fiduciary liability policy 
forms exclude coverage for bodily  injury and property damage. H owever, as also explained, the forms 
usually contain wording that ex cepts, and therefore covers, bod ily injury and property damage claims 
when they result from the management or administration of manag ed healthcare plans. The two most 
common allegations associated with such plans are that (1) the administrators of the plan were negligent 
in including an incompetent pro fessional within its network of medical providers or that (2) the 
administrators of the plan wrongfully denied (or delayed) treat ment that was covered by the plan and that, 
as a result of delay/denial of treatment, bodily injury or prop erty damage resulted. 
Other than in cases such as these, the policies preclude covera ge for bodily injury and property damage. 
Exposures Excluded by Other Typ es of Management and Professiona l 
Liability Policies 
In addition to the exclusions al ready discussed that are partic ular to fiduciary liabilit y insurance policies, a 
number of exclusions pertain to exposures also excluded by othe r types of management and professional 
liability policy forms. These are  noted in Exhibit 12.1 and dis cussed further in other courses within the 
Management Liability Insurance Specialist (MLIS) program. 
Exhibit 12.1 
Exclusions Found in Standard Professional Liability Policies 
 Claims reported to prior insurers 
 Claims covered by other insurance 
 Prior and pending litigation 
 Pollution

A. defend Bea until dishonest acts are proven by a criminal convic tion or an adverse 
judgment. 
B. defend Bea until dishonest acts are proven by a criminal convic tion or an adverse 
judgment and then pay any damages awarded on her behalf. 
C. deny coverage to Bea because the allegation involves dishonesty , which is not covered. 
D. deny coverage to Bea despite the  lack of an applicable exclusio n, because the alleged acts 
are contrary to public policy. 
2. Nearly all fiduciary liability policies _________ _ coverage for  most situations w here an insured 
has held a third-party service provider harmless in connection with the operation of a pension or 
benefit plan. 
A. endorse 
B. exclude 
C. limit 
D. provide 
3. Tonka Motors abruptly discharged a number of office employees i n order to shave expenses. 
Mary, one of the discharged employees, had been responsible for  collecting benefit plan 
contributions from the firm’s s ubsidiaries. It took 6 months be fore anybody noticed that nobody 
had taken over Mary’s responsib ilities. If a claim alleges that  Tonka Motors was negligent in 
failing to collect these contributions, 
A. coverage will be denied, because all fiduciary liability polici es have a failure to collect 
contributions exclusion. 
B. coverage will be denied because the act of collecting contribut ions is clearly within the 
control of the insured. 
C. coverage will be denied because the failure resulted from negli gence rather than an 
intentional act. 
D. some insurers’ fiduciary liab ility policies will provide covera ge because the failure 
resulted from unintentional negligence. 
4. Some fiduciary liability claims allege a failure to fund a plan  in accordance with the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act. M any fiduciary liability polici es 
A. provide both defense and indemnity coverage for these claims. 
B. provide defense coverage against  unproven allegations but exclu de coverage for 
intentional violations.

101 5. Soon after her late husband’s unfortunate fall from a cliff, Je an Coffy files a claim against the 
fiduciaries of his employee benef it plans. The husband’s employ ee handbook states that the 
company provides accidental death insurance under which an empl oyee’s beneficiary is entitled 
to receive accidental death insu rance benefits equal to three t imes his annual salary. The 
employer purchased accidental d eath coverage, but the insurer i s now insolvent. Most fiduciary 
liability policies preclude covera ge for Jean’s claim against t he employer’s fiduciaries

D. unless the fiduciary liability insu rer is also a financial guar antor of the insured 
employer’s benefit programs.  
102 Answers to Chapter 12 Review Questions 
1.  
A. That’s correct! Because an insure r’s duty to defend is generall y construed as being broader than its 
duty to indemnify, insurers typically provide defense coverage to allegations of fraud or criminal 
acts until such dishonest acts ar e actually proven by means of a criminal convic tion or an adverse 
judgment. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Insurance does not cover the intentio nal commission of illegal acts. 
C. This answer is incorrect. It’s only an allegation; Bea might no t be guilty of the alleged acts. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The policy has a dishonesty exclusion . 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Coverage for this situation is not us ually available. 
B. That’s correct! Subject to two ex ceptions, nearly all fiduciary  liability policies exclude coverage 
for situations where an insured has held a third-party service provider harmless in conjunction 
with the operation of a pension or benefit plan. 
C. This answer is incorrect. There is no sublimit for this coverag e. 
D. This answer is incorrect. Insure rs are not eager to provide thi s coverage. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Not a ll policies have this exclusion.  
B. This answer is incorr ect. Although it is within the insured’s c ontrol, there can be situations like 
this in which the insured unintentionally fails to make its col lections. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Some  policies cover negligence. 
D. That’s correct! A handful of insurers provide coverage if it is  alleged that failure to collect 
contributions was the result of the insured’s negligence, rathe r than the result of an intentional act. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Only  one of the two is covered. 
B. That’s correct! Covering the exposure would be against public p olicy, but defending allegations of 
violating federal law is not against public policy. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Some coverage is provided for these c laims. 
D. This answer is incorr ect. Failure to fund a  plan is an intentio nal violation of federal law. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The benefit promised in the employee handbook might be considered a 
contractual obligation. 
B. This answer is incorrect. An outside organization (the insurer)  providing benefits to the insured’s 
employees is not an insured. 
C. That’s correct! Most fiduciary  liability policies preclude cove rage for an insured fiduciary’s 
payment of benefits owed to a c laimant unless the claim results  from a wrongful act, such as 
knowing at the time the policy wa s purchased that the accidenta l death insurer was financially 
unsound. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The exclusion is designed to prevent the fiduciary liability insurer from 
becoming a financial guarantor of benefits due until an insured  corporation’s benefit program.  
103 Chapter 13 
Fiduciary Liability Policy Coverage Triggers 
Overview 
This chapter addresses the essential features of claims-made co verage triggers as they appear within 
fiduciary liability policies. Vir tually all the major insurers’  policy forms are written on a claims-made 
basis. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the differences between  occurrence triggers and claims -made triggers, 
 identify the distinctive featur es of a claims-made policy, and 
 given relevant information concer ning a claim, determine whethe r claims-made coverage has 
been triggered. 
Operation of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
To be covered under a claims-m ade policy, a claim must be 
1. first made  against an insured during the policy period, 
2. result from a wrongful act that took place on or after the poli cy’s retroactive date , and 
3. be reported to the insurer  prior to the expiration of the policy (or within 30 to 60 days  following 
expiration). 
The italicized terms will be explai ned in the pages that follow . 
Operation of a claims-made cove rage trigger is illustrated in E xhibit 13.1.  
104 Exhibit 13.1 
How a Claims-Made Policy Functions 
Policy Period: 1/1/21–1/1/22 
Retro Date: 1/1/20 Wrongful Act: 7/1/20 
Claim Made: 7/1/21 
Claim Reported: 9/1/21 
 
In this example, coverage applies because: (1) the claim was fi rst made against the insured 
during the 1/1/21–22 policy period , (2) the wrongful act that c aused the claim took place after the 
policy’s 1/1/20 retroactive date , and (3) the claim was reporte d to the insurer prior to policy 
expiration. Had the wrongful ac t taken place prior to the polic y’s 1/1/20 retr oactive date, 
coverage would not hav e applied. Similarly , there would have be en no coverage under the 
1/1/21–1/1/22 policy had the clai m been made against the insure d prior to 1/1/21 or after 1/1/22. 
The Significance of “First Made” Language 
Use of the term “first made” is significant because it indicate s that coverage will apply only when the 
claim has not already been (1) made in conjunction with a previ ous policy written by the current insurer 
or (2) made under a policy written by a different insurer, cove ring the insured prior to the current insurer. 
Claims-Made and Reported Policies 
Under a minority of fiduciary po licies, coverage applies only i f the claim is both first made against the 
insured and reported to the ins urer during the policy period. T his is known as a “claims-made and 
reported” policy. For example, under such a policy with a Janua ry 1, 2020–21, term, no coverage would 
apply unless a claim was both mad e against the insured during t he policy period and reported to the 
insurer prior to January 1, 2021. 
Claims-Made Policies and Reported Po licies with Post-Policy Rep orting “Windows” 
In contrast, a majority of forms provide what are known as post -policy claim reporting “windows,” under 
which claims made against the in sured during the policy period can be reported to the insurer for either 30 
or 60 days (depending on the insu rer) after expiration of the p olicy. 
Fiduciary liability forms cont aining post-policy reporting “win dows” are preferable to claims-made and 
reported policies not containi ng post-policy reporting windows.  This is because some circumstances 
could render it impossible for an insured to report a claim mad e late in a policy period. For example, if a 
summons is delivered to an insured pension trustee’s office lat e in the day that a policy expires, the 
insured may be unable to notify the insurer within the policy p eriod. This may be especially true if he or 
she is not in the office that day  or if the summons were served  late in the day at the start of a long, holiday 
weekend, as a result of which the insurer’s office had closed e arlier than usual. Under such circumstances, 
a claims-made policy that contains  a 30- or, preferably for the  insured, a 60-day post-policy reporting 
window is advantageous for the i nsured compared to a claims-mad e and reported policy, because it allows 
an insured to report a claim to the insurer after the term of c overage has expired.  
 
105 Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates in fiduciary liability policies state that fo r coverage to apply, the wrongful act giving 
rise to a claim must have taken place on or after the retroacti ve date. Thus, retroactive dates preclude 
coverage for claims stemming from acts that took place prior to  a policy’s retroactive date. 
Purposes of Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates have the eff ect of excluding coverage for pos sible wrongful acts committed in 
conjunction with some known even t (i.e., known to the insured) that took place prior to policy inception. 
They also preclude coverage for w rongful acts that transpired i n the distant past—even if unknown to the 
insured. 
Retroactive dates are generally i ncluded in fiduciary liability  policies for organizations that are buying 
coverage for the first time. T his is because underwriters are r eluctant to offer “full prior acts coverage” 
(i.e., policies without retroactive dates) under such circumsta nces. Their concern is that the insured’s 
sudden desire to obtain a policy may have been prompted by the need to obtain coverage for 
circumstances they suspect coul d produce a claim in the future.  For example, if a company began offering 
a full program of employee benefits on January 1, 2010, but did  not seek to buy fiduciary liability 
coverage until January 1, 2020, a n underwriter could have the i mpression that the company expects a 
claim to be made against it s hortly, since it operated these pl ans for 10 years without purchasing fiduciary 
liability coverage. 
“Full Prior Acts”: Coverage without a Retroactive Date 
However, for a firm that alread y has a fiduciary liability poli cy in place with another insurer, inclusion of 
a retroactive date should be resisted unless there is a specifi c underwriting reason, such as a complete 
change in the company’s pension and benefit programs. By elimin ating a retroactive date, a policy will 
provide what is known as “full prior acts coverage” for all act s, going back to when the company’s 
benefit programs were initiated. 
Retro date should be no later than the insured’s first fiduciar y liability policy inception date.  
Ideally, an insured will have a policy written with full prior acts coverage. But at the very least, an insured 
should always require an insurer to offer a policy with a retro active date that coincides with the date on 
which it first began buying fi duciary liability coverage (known  as “prior acts” coverage), even if that date 
precedes the date on which its cu rrent insurer first began writ ing coverage. If an insured’s retroactive date 
does not coincide with the date on which it first began buying coverage, a coverage gap will result since 
there will be no coverage for w rongful acts that took place bet ween the inception date of the first 
fiduciary liability policy the insured purchased and the retroa ctive date of the ne w insurer’s policy. 
Always resist retroactive date advancements when replacing cove rage.  At times, underwriters may 
seek an “advanced” retroactive da te when writing coverage for a  new account. This has the effect of 
limiting the coverage they are willing to provide to the start of the period of time this new insurer will be 
on the account. This approach is detrimental for an insured bec ause it provides no coverage for wrongful 
acts that took place from the inception date of its first polic y to the inception date of the new insurer’s 
policy. 
Accordingly, insureds under fiduciary liability policies and th eir agents/brokers should always resist such 
advancements, even if  additional premium is required to achieve  “prior acts” coverage. If this is not 
possible, insureds can still purchase extended reporting period s (ERPs) from their current insurer. (ERPs 
are discussed later in this chapter.) However, as will be noted , there are a number of disadvantages 
inherent in ERPs, including the  fact that they are costly and u sually apply for only 1 year.  
106 Discovery Provisions 
Circumstances often arise under which it is probable that an ac t, error, or omission will eventually cause a 
claim to be made agai nst insureds under fiduciary liability pol icies—despite the fact that litigation may 
not be initiated for some time. Accordingly, virtually all fidu ciary liability policies provide, by means of 
what are called “discovery pr ovisions” (also known as “incident  reporting provisions” or “notice of 
potential claim provisions”), that if the insured advises the i nsurer of “incidents” or “potential claims” 
during the policy, any actual claims arising out of such “incid ents” will be considered to have been 
“made” during that policy period. 
Use of a Discovery Provision: An Example 
The trustee of a corporation’s de fined benefit pension plan rev eals in a report to employee beneficiaries 
that the plan is seriously underfunded and might not be able to  continue paying promised benefits in the 
future. After an announcement of this nature, and even before a ctual claims have been filed, there is a 
strong possibility that beneficia ries of the plan will eventual ly initiate legal action against the insured 
fiduciaries. 
A discovery provision allows the i nsured to give notice of a po tential claim under these and similar 
circumstances. When such notice is provided to the insurer, cov erage for claims arising out of reported 
incidents will apply regardless of  how far in the future actual  claims are made. Exhibit 13.2 illustrates the 
operation of a discovery provision. 
Exhibit 13.2 
How a Discovery Provision Functions 
Policy Term: 1/1/21–22 
 
In this example, coverage applie s under the 1/1/20–21 policy te rm because the insurer was 
notified by the insured of an “incident” on 8/1/20. Although th e claim associated w ith the incident 
was not made against t he insured until after the 1/1/20–21 policy had ex pired, coverage applies 
nonetheless because the in surer was notified of the incident un der the policy’s discovery 
provision during the 1/1/20–21 policy period. Coverage will alw ays be available regardless of 
how far in the future a claim is made in conjunction with the i ncident. 
Catch-22 Aspects of Discovery Pro visions: To “Laundry List” or Not 
Despite the benefits they convey, discovery provisions are not without drawbacks. On the surface, it 
would appear to benefit an insur ed to notify his or her insurer  of all possible, potential claims prior to 
policy expiration—a practice known as “laundry listing.” Howeve r, four problems may result when an 
insured engages in this practice. 
 Higher Premiums in Renewal Policies. Although a claim may not yet have been made, an 
underwriter will be inclined to provide a somewhat higher premi um in renewal policies, given the 
potential claim(s) that the underwriter could be called on to p ay in the future. A safety margin of 
this kind will therefore increase the cost of an insured’s rene wal policy(ies). 
  
 
107  Possible Cancellation/Nonrenewal. Many underwriters believe tha t “frequency breeds severity.” 
Therefore, if an insured reports  numerous incidents, it could i ndicate recurring problems 
associated with the insured’s be nefit plans that might, at some  time, eventually produce a 
catastrophic loss. Accordingly, if, in the underwriter’s percep tion, an insured begins to overreport 
incidents, the underwriter may qu estion the wisdom of continuin g to insure such plans and their 
fiduciaries—at any premium—and may be inclined to cancel or ref use to renew upon expiration. 
 Problems When Changing Insurers. Reporting numerous incidents under discovery provisions 
makes it more difficult for an insured to secure replacement co verage should the insured decide to 
change insurers. This is because when an insured has already di sclosed circumstances 
surrounding possible claims to an incumbent insurer, the insure d must also reveal these 
circumstances (on the applicati on form) to an insurer that is p roviding a quotation for a 
replacement policy. This has two important implications. First,  the replacement insurer will not 
cover claims that may eventually be made in conjunction with su ch incidents. Second, if several 
such circumstances are revealed on the application, the prospec tive replacement insurer might 
become wary of the insured and decline to provide coverage or, at best, offer a much higher quote 
than it would have had the insur ed reported a number of inciden ts. 
 Possible Admission of Culpability. If an insured reports an incident to an insurer, and the 
incident eventually gives rise to  a claim, evidence of that rep ort will be discoverable by the 
claimant’s attorney during the litigation process. While a repo rt of this kind is not necessarily an 
admission of an insured’s culpab ility, it nevertheless provides  evidence that the fiduciary was 
concerned either about the level of competence with which the i nsured’s benefit programs had 
been administered or about adverse outcomes associated with the  way in which the benefit 
programs had been managed. Either way, evidence of the report—r egardless of whether the 
insured’s conduct was not neglig ent—will make it more difficult  to defend the insured against a 
claim. 
It is, however, always a good approach for insureds to report a ll relevant information concerning an 
incident, especially any details  that would absolve, or at leas t mitigate, the professional’s potential 
liability. 
When “Laundry Listing” Is A dvantageous for the Insured 
A certain degree of selectivity is required when notifying an i nsurer of potential claims under a policy’s 
discovery provision. However, in one situation, it is clearly a dvantageous to report every possible incident 
as a potential claim. This happens when an insurer will no long er be writing a specific line of coverage 
and therefore nonrenews or cancels all policies (of a certain c overage line or in a specific territory, for 
example). 
In this case, an insured may consider reporting more possible c ircumstances under a policy’s discovery 
provision than he or she ordinarily would be inclined if the po licy were being renewed. By laundry listing 
these circumstances, the insured would not be faced with higher  renewal premiums or possible 
cancellation/nonrenewal by the incu mbent insurer. Also importan t is the fact that a replacement insurer 
would tend to be more understandi ng of an insured who “laundry lists” under these conditions, 
recognizing that the measure is more justifiable because there is no guarantee that the insured will be able 
to secure a replacement policy. 
   
108 Extended Reporting Provisions 
ERPs, which are also known as exte nded discovery or “tail” prov isions and are included in all fiduciary 
liability policies, give an insur ed the right to present claims  to the insurer after a policy has expired or 
been canceled. Exhibit 13.3 illustrates how an ERP provision fu nctions. 
Exhibit 13.3 
How an ERP Functions 
Insurer A’s Policy Term: 1/1/21–22 
Insured buys an ERP from Insurer  A with an ERP term of 1/1/22–2 3 
Wrongful Act: 7/1/21 
Claim Made and Reported: 7/1/22 
 
Coverage applies under  the ERP because the wr ongful act took pl ace during Insurer A’s 1/1/21–
22 policy term and a cl aim associated with the act was made and  reported during the term of 
Insurer A’s 1/1/22–23 ERP. One fi nal, key point regarding ERPs:  No coverage would have 
applied in this example if both t he wrongful act took place and  the claim were reported during the 
1/1/22–23 ERP. Rather, t he wrongful act mus t take place during the expired/canceled policy 
period for coverage to apply during the ERP.  
ERPs Do Not Reinstate Remaining Policy Limits 
ERPs do not, however, increase or reinstate the policy’s limit of liability. Thus, cove rage during an ERP 
is always subject to available remaining limits under the origi nal policy. In some instances, especially 
where one or more significant claims are pending under an expir ing policy, insurers will, at times, make 
additional limits available under an ERP provision. However, re instatement of this type will almost 
always require substantial add itional premium, over and above t he scale provided for in the policy, and as 
discussed below. 
No Coverage for Wrongful Acts during the ERP 
Nor do ERPs cover claims from wrongful acts that took place dur ing the ERP. In effect, they only extend 
the time period during which wrongful acts that took place duri ng the expired (or in some instances, 
canceled) policy can be reported  to the insurer. Thus, for cove rage to apply under an ERP, the alleged 
wrongful act giving rise to the claim must have taken place on or after the retroactive date, if any, of the 
policy and before the policy’s termination date. ERPs do not af ford coverage for an act that took place 
during the ERP itself, despite the fact that such a claim is re ported during the ERP. 
Discovery Provisions versus ERPs 
Although these two provisions are  often confused, the differenc e is actually straightforward. Discovery 
provisions allow insureds to obtai n coverage for incidents or p otential claims that are reported during the 
policy period. In contrast, ERPs  provide coverage for claims th at are reported after a policy period has 
expired. 
 
109 Key Variations between ERP Provisions 
There are several important variations between the key provisio ns associated with ERPs as the different 
fiduciary liability insurers wr ite them. These differences are described in the following paragraphs. 
Availability 
Fiduciary liability forms permit the insured to purchase an ERP  if cancellation/nonrenewal is at the 
insured’s or the insurer’s elec tion. This is known as a two-way  or bilateral tail. (At one time, a minority of 
insurers provided this option only in the event that the insure r initiated cancellation/nonrenewal, termed a 
one-way tail. Currently, virtually  no insurers write policies c ontaining one-way tails.) 
Coverage for “Notice of Circums tances” or “Incidents” during th e ERP 
A key variation between the ERPs in fiduciary liability forms i s whether a report of circumstances that 
have the potential to result—but have not yet resulted—in a for mal claim against the  insured are covered 
by an ERP. In effect, under some insurers’ ERP wording, the pol icy’s discovery provision (discussed 
earlier in this chapter) is opera tive, whereas in others, it is  not. The majority, but not  all, fiduciary liability 
insurers provide coverage for “ incidents” reported to the insur er during the term of the ERP. 
To illustrate: A fiduciary liability policy expires on January 1, 2020, at which time the insured firm buys a 
1-year ERP. On August 1, 2020, t he insured firm becomes aware o f circumstances (from a wrongful act 
that took place during the expire d policy) that could potential ly materialize into a formal claim but has not 
yet. Under some insurers’ polici es, the report of such circumst ances would trigger coverage. 
However, under other insurers’ ER P wording, no coverage would a pply until the insured has a formal 
claim made against it, even if these circumstances are reported  to the insurer during the ERP. Under these 
types of policies, the insured w ould be compelled to purchase ( if available) another ERP at the expiration 
of the current ERP if the potential claim had not yet been made  against the firm but was expected at some 
point. In this situation, the advantage of having a policy’s di scovery provision that is operative during the 
ERP provision is apparent. This concept is illustrated in Exhib it 13.4. 
Exhibit 13.4  
Coverage for “Incidents” during an ERP  
Policy Period: 1/1/20–1/1/21  
ERP: 1/1/21–1/1/22  
Incident Date: 7/1/21  Policy states that coverage appli es to “incidents” reported to insurer during ERP  
 
In this situation, coverage app lies to the incident reported to  the insurer 
on 7/1/21. This is because the pol icy states that in addition t o covering 
“claims” made against the insur ed during the term of the ERP, c overage 
also applies to “incidents” reported during the ERP. 
  
 
110 Duration 
In most instances, fiduciary liability insurers offer ERPs of 1  year in duration, although in a few cases, 
ERPs of longer duration are offered, as well. Multiple duration  options (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years) 
are occasionally available under fiduciary liability policies w ritten for privately held and not-for-profit 
organizations. However, publicly t raded companies are rarely of fered anything other than a 1-year option. 
Premium Charge 
In nearly all instances, the polic ies state the premium charge for the ERP option. This is typically done by 
indicating that the ERP will cost a fixed percentage of the exp iring policy’s premium; normally 100 –150 
percent, depending upon the individual policy, for a 1-year ERP . 
Time in Which To Elect 
The policies allow the insured up to 30 days following nonrenew al, expiration, or cancellation to purchase 
the ERP. A few allow as long as 60 days in which to make this e lection, which is, of course, preferable 
since it is beneficial to maximize the time period in which the  insured can make this election. 
Runoff Policies 
As an alternative to an ERP, under certain circumstances, insur eds should consider purchasing a runoff 
policy. 
Runoff Policies versus ERPs 
Like ERPs, runoff policies also permit an insured to report cla ims (that resulted from wrongful acts that 
took place during prior policy periods) for a specified period of time in the future. In contrast, the use of 
runoff policies is typically restricted to situations in which an insured merges with or is acquired by 
another organization, rather than when the insured replaces cov erage with another insurer, as is usually 
the case when an ERP is purchased. Like ERPs, runoff policies a re usually offered on a 1-year basis. 
However, unlike ERPs, they are generally offered on a 1-year, a nnually renewable basis.  
111 Chapter 13 Review Questions 
1. Chuck Little made a fiduciary liability claim against Blue Sky Company’s benefit plan 
administrators last year when Blue Sky was insured by Egg Insur ance Company. Upon hearing 
that Blue Sky never reported the claim to its insurer before it  changed insurers and is now insured 
by Chicken Insurance Company, he files another claim with the s ame allegations, which Blue Sky 
promptly reports to Chicken Insurance Company. Because both pol icies have claim s-first-made 
language in their policy triggers , Chuck’s claims trigger cover age under 
A. Egg Insurance Company’s policy. 
B. Chicken Insurance Company’s policy. 
C. both Egg Insurance Company and Chicken Insurance Company polici es. 
D. neither Egg Insurance Company nor Chicken Insurance Company pol icies. 
2. Mirror Company’s fiduciary liability policy has a January 1, 20 15, retroactive date. Assuming all 
other conditions are met, coverage applies under the policy for  claims resulting from wrongful 
acts that take place 
A. after the policy expires on January 1, 2015. 
B. before January 1, 2015. 
C. before the policy expires on January 1, 2015. 
D. on or after January 1, 2015. 
3. When investigators broke the new s that Daniel had made off with  millions of dollars invested in 
his Ponzi scheme, trustees of t he Gopher-Broke defined benefit plan revealed that plan funds had 
been heavily invested in Daniel ’s worthless scheme and the plan  might now be unable to pay 
promised benefits. Trustees predict that plan beneficiaries wil l bring actions against them for 
years to come and regret having made such bad investment decisi ons. If the trustees utilize their 
fiduciary liability policy’s disc overy provision and report thi s incident to the insurer during the 
current policy period, 
A. any resulting claims will be treated as though they were made b efore the retroactive date 
expires. 
B. any resulting claims will be treated as though they are made du ring the current policy 
period. 
C. the trustees enable the insurer to allocate policy limits among  the resulting claims. 
D. the trustees preserve their rights to renew the policy despite this incident. 
4. Wyatt’s fiduciary liability polic y has a policy term of July 1,  2016–July 1, 2017, and an extended 
reporting period (ERP) term of July 1, 2017–July 1, 2018. A wro ngful act took place on October 
1, 2017, and a claim was made a nd reported to the insurer on Fe bruary 1, 2018. In this situation, 
A. coverage applies because the event occurred and the claim was m ade during Wyatt’s 
ERP. 
B. coverage applies because the event occurred and the claim was m ade during Wyatt’s 
policy period. 
C. coverage does not apply because the event occurred after the po licy period. 
D. coverage does not apply because th e claim was made after the po licy period.  
112 5. Irma, the new risk manager for Woods Company, is reviewing Wood s’s insurance portfolio when 
she comes across a fiduciary lia bility policy with an attached Post-It note that reads 
“CANCELED.” She also sees that  the cancellation took place two weeks ago. Irma thinks an 
extended reporting period (ERP) s hould be added, but first Irma  wants to know who initiated the 
cancelation. Is this information relevant, and if so, why? 
A. If Woods’s policy has a one-way tail, the ERP will not be avail able unless Woods 
initiated the cancellation. 
B. If Woods’s policy has a two-way tail, the ERP will not be avail able if the insurer initiated 
the cancellation. 
C. It probably is not relevant. 
D. The premium for the ERP will be  much higher if Woods initiated the cancellation.  
113 Answers to Chapter 13 Review Questions 
1.  
A. This answer is incorrect. Egg’s policy is not triggered. 
B. This answer is incorrect. Chicken’s policy is not triggered. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Both policies are not triggered. 
D. That’s correct! Coverage applies under neither policy. No cover age applies under the Egg 
Insurance Company policy, because  the claim was never reported to the insurer. No coverage 
applies under the Chicken Insura nce Company policy because the wrongful act giving rise to the 
claim took place during the Egg Insurance Company’s policy term . But despite having knowledge 
of the claim, the insured never reported it to Egg Insurance Co mpany. Therefore, Chicken 
Insurance Company would be able to deny coverage for late repor ting of a claim about which the 
insured had prior knowledge. 
2.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The retroactive date would not be the  date when the policy expires. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The acts must take place after that d ate. 
C. This answer is incorrect. The re troactive date is not the same as the expiration date. 
D. That’s correct! For coverage to apply, the wrongful act giving rise to a claim must have taken 
place on or after the retroactive date. 
3.  
A. This answer is incorrect. A retr oactive date does not expire. 
B. That’s correct! If the insured advises the insurer of “incident s” or “potential claims” during the 
policy period, any actual claims arising out of such “incidents ” will be considered to have been 
made during that policy period. 
C. This answer is incorrect. Rathe r, the trustees want to trigger coverage. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The trustees will probably find it di fficult to renew their coverage. 
4.  
A. This answer is incorrect. The ev ent should have occurred during  the policy period. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The event and the claim happened afte r the policy period. 
C. That’s correct! No coverage app lies if the wrongful act takes p lace and the claim is reported 
during the ERP; rather, the wr ongful act must take place during  the expired/canceled policy period 
for coverage to apply during the ERP. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The cl aim was made during the ERP. 
5.  
A. This answer is incorrect. In the  unlikely event that the policy  has a one-way tail, the ERP would 
only be available if the insurer initiated the cancellation. 
B. This answer is incorrect. The ERP would be available if the ins urer initiated the cancellation. 
C. That’s correct! Virtually no insurers write one-way tails that permit the ERP option only when the 
insurer initiates cancellation. 
D. This answer is incorrect. The premium charge for the ERP option  is typically set at a fixed 
percentage of the expiring policy’s premium and is not dependen t on which party initiated the 
cancellation.  
114 Glossary 
401(k) plan— The most common type of defined contribution retirement plan, i n which employees 
choose to defer part of their compensation. Under the typical 4 01(k), employees contribute anywhere 
from 1 percent to 15 percent of their pre-tax annual salary eac h year to the plan. In addition to this 
amount, many employers will match the employee’s contribution, such as 50 percent of up to 6 percent of 
the employee’s contribution. For example, if an employee contri butes 6 percent of his or her salary to the 
401(k) plan, the employer will c ontribute an additional 3 perce nt so that the employee will have saved a 
total of 9 percent of his or her annual salary (i.e., 6 percent  contribution, plus 3 percent employer match). 
There are annual maximum amount s that employees can contribute as well as distribution restrictions 
prior to age 59.5. 
actuarial solvency— A situation in which, based upo n certain key assumptions, such as the expected rate 
of return on pension plan assets and the mortality experience o f the pension plan’s beneficiaries, a 
pension plan will have sufficien t funds with which to pay all b enefits that are promised by the plan. 
blackout period— A time period during which participants in a 401(k) plan are no t permitted to make 
changes in their investment allocations. The typical blackout p eriod lasts from 4 to 6 weeks and is 
imposed when an employer-sponsor  of a 401(k) plan changes from one plan administrator to another. 
Claims against fiduciaries charged with overseeing such plans m ost frequently arise when the stock 
market falls sharply during bl ackout periods. Claims are more l ikely at such times, because employees are 
unable to transfer monies out of stocks and thus reduce losses.  To reduce exposure to such claims, 
companies offering 401(k) plans should provide notice of blacko ut periods well in advance of the date on 
which they are scheduled to begin. 
cash balance pension plan— A type of employee pension benefit plan that has two distinct f eatures: (1) 
the employer contributes to the plan an amount equal to a perce ntage of an employee’s yearly earnings, 
and (2) the plan promises a speci fic rate of return on that con tribution. Under a cash balance plan, the 
benefit is always expressed as a total account balance. Cash ba lance pension plans are distinct from 
“traditional” defined benefit pension plans, which, in contrast , promise an employee a flat dollar amount 
(either on a periodic or on a lump-sum basis), based on years o f service and an employee’s earnings in the 
years closest to retirement. The  focus of cash balance plans is  on wealth building and portability. On the 
other hand, traditional defined be nefit plans are aimed at enco uraging career employment with a single 
employer. In recent years, consid erable litigation has arisen o ut of employer conversions from 
“traditional” defined benefit to  cash balance pension plans. Ol der, long-term employees who typically 
receive lower benefits under cash balance plans have alleged th at such plans are unfairly discriminatory. 
claims-made and reported policy— A type of claims-made policy in w hich a claim must be both made  
against the insured and reported to the insurer during the poli cy period for coverage to apply. Claims-
made and reported policies are unf avorable from the insured’s s tandpoint because it is sometimes difficult 
to report a claim to an insurer during a policy period if the c laim is made late in that policy period. 
However, more liberal versions of claims-made and reported poli cies provide post-policy “windows,” 
which allow insureds to report cl aims to the insurer within 30 to 60 days following policy expiration. 
claims-made policy— A policy providing coverage that is triggered when a claim is m ade against the 
insured during the policy period, regardless of when the wrongf ul act that gave rise to the claim took 
place. (The one exception is when a retroactive date is applica ble to a claims-made policy. In such 
instances, the wrongful act that gave rise to the claim must ha ve taken place on or after the retroactive  
115 date.) Most professional, errors and omissions (E&O), directors  and officers (D&O), and employment 
practices liability insurance ( EPLI) is written as claims-made policies. 
COBRA— See Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. 
coinsurance hammer clause— An alternative to the standard h ammer clause found within profe ssional, 
directors and officers (D&O), and errors and omissions (E&O) po licy forms. Such a provision provides 
for a sharing of defense and indemnity costs (between the insur ed and the insurer) incurred after the 
insured refuses to consent to a settlement proposed by an insur er. The most common sharing percentage is 
50/50, but it can sometimes go higher (e.g., 70 insurer/30 insu red). The effect of such clauses is to reduce 
the amount of indemnity and defense costs that an insured could  potentially incur if it refuses to consent 
to a settlement amount recommended by an insurer. 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985— A federal law giving workers 
and their families who lose thei r health insurance benefits aft er leaving a job the right to continue 
receiving those benefits. COBRA r equires that group health insu rance plans sponsored by employers with 
20 or more employees in the prior year offer employees and thei r families an opportunity for a temporary, 
18-month extension of health cove rage, when such coverage would  normally end. Qualified individuals 
must pay the entire premium that would otherwise be paid by the  employer, plus a 2 percent 
administrative fee. Generally, only about 10 percent of workers  eligible for COBRA benefits elect them, 
usually because they are unable to afford the cost following th e loss of a job. 
defense within limits— A liability policy provision acco rding to which amounts paid by  the insurer to 
defend the insured against a claim or suit reduce the policy’s applicable limit of insurance. General 
liability policies are ordinarily not subject to such a provisi on, although the standard  commercial general 
liability (CGL) policy provides for defense of the named insure d’s indemnitee “within limits” when the 
named insured has a contractual obligation to provide such a de fense. Defense within limits is more 
common in professional liability policies. 
defined benefit plan— A pension plan providing a specific benefit for each employee. The employer is 
required to make adequate contri butions to the plan to fund the  promised benefits. No individual accounts 
are maintained as is done in defined contribution plans. 
defined contribution plan— A pension plan calling for defi nite annual contributions by the  employer but 
with no specific benefit promised to the employee. The employee ’s benefits are ultimately determined by 
the amount contributed plus the investment income. 
discovery provisions— Provisions that permit insureds t o report incidents or circumst ances that may 
result in claims in the futur e, found mainly in professional li ability insurance policies written with claims-
made coverage triggers. Discovery  provisions, which are also kn own as “awareness” or “notice of 
potential claim” provisions, allow an insured to lock in covera ge for such events so that coverage will 
apply under the current claims-ma de policy, regardless of how f ar in the future a cla im is eventually made 
in conjunction with the incid ent that has been reported. 
duty to defend— A term used to describe an insure r’s obligation to provide an i nsured with defense to 
claims made under a liability ins urance policy. As a general ru le, an insured need only establish that there 
is potential for coverage under a policy to give rise to the in surer’s duty to defend. Therefore, the duty to 
defend may exist even where cove rage is in doubt and ultimately  does not apply. Implicit in this rule is 
the principle that an insurer’s duty to defend an insured is br oader than its duty to indemnify. Moreover, 
an insurer may owe a duty to def end its insured against a claim  in which ultimately no damages are 
awarded, and any doubt as to whether the facts support a duty t o defend is usually resolved in the 
insured’s favor. 
   
116 With respect to directors and officers (D&O) and employment pra ctices liability insurance (EPLI) 
policies, policies containing explicit “duty to defend” wording  obligate an insurer to assume control of the 
claim defense process, including  selecting counsel and paying l egal bills. In contrast, non-duty to defend 
(or duty to pay) policies require only that the insurer reimbur se the insured for funds expended by the 
insured in defending a claim. 
employee benefits liability— Liability of an employer for an error or omission in the admini stration of an 
employee benefit program, such as failure to advise employees o f benefit programs. Coverage of this 
exposure is usually provided by endorsement to the general liab ility policy but may also be provided by a 
fiduciary liability policy. 
employee benefits liability insurance— Policies that cover claims involving nondiscretionary, 
administrative errors pertaining to pension and benefit plans ( e.g., failing to name an intended beneficiary 
on a life insurance policy, failu re to enroll an employee in a company 401(k) plan). 
employee pension benefit plans— Plans created by an employer, a  union, or both that provide for  
retirement income or the deferra l of income (e.g., 401(k) plans , “traditional” defined benefit pension 
plans). These plans are distinguished from employee welfare ben efit plans like employer-provided health, 
life, and disability insurance plans that address the non-incom e-related aspects of employee benefits. 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)— Federal law that established rules and 
regulations to govern employer-pr ovided pensions and other empl oyee benefits provided to US 
employees. 
employee welfare benefit plans— Plans, funds, or programs created by an employer or a union to 
provide medical, sickness, accide nt, disability, death, unemplo yment, and vacation benefits; 
apprenticeship and training programs; day care centers; scholar ship funds; prepaid legal services; or any 
benefit allowed by the Taft-Hartley Act. These plans are distin guished from employee pension benefit 
plans that provide for retirement income or the deferral of inc ome (e.g., “traditional” defined benefit 
pension plans, 401(k) plans). 
ERISA— See Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
ERISA “stock drop” litigation— Litigation brought against corporate directors and officers and  trustees 
of corporate 401(k) plans. Such litigation, normally filed in t he form of a class action lawsuit, arises when 
the market price of a company’s stock drops sharply, and, as a consequence, employee 401(k) plan 
holders lose substantial sums o f money because they hold large amounts of company stock in their 
individual accounts. In these lawsuits, employee-plaintiffs all ege that the directors and officers were 
fiduciaries of the 401(k) plans  and that the conduct governing the administration of such plans is therefore 
governed by the provisions found within the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act (ERISA). 
Among the most common allegations of negligence asserted in the se claims are (1) intentional disclosure 
of false and misleading informa tion about the company’s finance s, which induced the employees to buy 
shares of the company’s stock; ( 2) failure to disclose material  information about the company and its 
financial condition and performan ce, in statements to the gener al public, to shareholders, or to employees; 
(3) failure to disclose such information to other plan fiduciar ies (such as investment advisers and brokers) 
who had responsibility for investing plan assets; and (4) failu re to correct misleading statements made by 
other officers and plan fiduciaries and failure to adequately m onitor wrongdoing by other plan fiduciaries. 
ERISA— See Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
ERP— See extended reporting period. 
extended reporting period (ERP)— A designated time period after a claims-made policy has expired  
during which a claim may be mad e and coverage triggered as if t he claim had been made during the 
policy period.  
117 fiduciary— As defined by the Employee Retir ement Income Security Act (ERIS A), an individual or 
corporation that (1) exercises any discretionary authority or d iscretionary control in managing a pension 
or benefit plan or exercises any authority or control in managi ng or disposing of its assets; (2) renders 
investment advice for a fee or o ther compensation, with respect  to any monies or other property belonging 
to the plan; or (3) has any discretionary authority or responsi bility in administering the plan. ERISA, 
which was passed in 1974, not only formalized the law associate d with the administration of employee 
pension and benefit plans; it al so broadened the scope of such liability so that it became a “personal” 
rather than simply a “corporate” liability. The effect of this change was that soon after ERISA’s 
enactment, insurance companies be gan offering fiduciary liabili ty insurance policies, which were 
specifically designed to cover this newly legislated exposure. 
fiduciary liability— The responsibility on trustees, employers, fiduciaries, profess ional administrators, 
and the plan itself with respect to errors and omissions (E&O) in the administration of employee benefit 
programs as imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). 
fiduciary liability insurance —Insurance that covers claims alleging breach of discretionary duties 
specified by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA ) of 1974 law (e.g., failure to invest 
plan assets prudently, failure to select a qualified service pr ovider to a covered plan). Insureds under 
fiduciary liability policies incl ude both the corporate entity that sponsors the covered plans as well as the 
individuals who serve as fiduciaries of such plans. 
full prior acts coverage— A type of claims-made liability policy that does not contain a retroactive date 
and therefore covers claims arising from acts that took place a t any time prior to the inception date of the 
policy—regardless of how far in the past. For example, assume t hat an insured has a claims-made policy 
that includes a January 1, 2000, retroactive date and a January  1, 2016–17, term. If a claim is made 
against the insured on July 1, 2016, and the claim arose from a  wrongful act that took place on January 1, 
1998, there would be no coverage  under the policy. This is beca use the wrongful act took place prior to 
the January 1, 2000, retroactive date. Now assume that another insured has a policy written with the same 
January 1, 2016–17, policy term, but the policy contains no ret roactive date. If a claim were made against 
the insured on July 1, 2016, from a wrongful act that took plac e on January 1, 1998, coverage would 
apply because the absence of a ret roactive date means that rega rdless of how far in the past a wrongful act 
giving rise to a claim took pl ace, the claim will be covered (a s long as it is made against the insured 
during the policy period). Full prior acts coverage is most lik ely to be granted when an applicant already 
has coverage in place at the time it submits an application. On  the other hand, underwriters generally do 
not provide full prior acts covera ge to insureds that have not previously purchased liability insurance. 
This is because underwriters sometimes believe that an applican t’s desire to buy coverage at this juncture 
may be motivated by the applican t’s intention to report a claim  under the new policy. 
hammer clause— A provision (also known as the “consent to settlement clause” a nd “blackmail 
settlement clause”) found in professional liability insurance p olicies that requires an insurer to seek an 
insured’s approval prior to se ttling a claim for a specific amo unt. However, if the insured does not 
approve the recommended figure, t he consent to settlement claus e states that the insurer will not be liable 
for any additional monies require d to settle the claim or for t he defense costs that accrue from the point 
after the insurer makes th e settlement recommendation. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996— A federal law that affords 
rights and protections for partic ipants and beneficiaries in gr oup health plans. HIPAA includes (1) 
protections for coverage under gr oup health plans that would ot herwise limit or exc lude coverage for 
preexisting conditions, (2) prohibitions of discrimination agai nst employees and dependents based on 
their health status, and (3) allowance of a special opportunity  for employees to enroll in a new plan, under 
certain circumstances, known as “open enrollment.” 
HIPAA— See Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  
118 interrelated claims provision— Provisions within professional lia bility insurance policies sta ting that if 
more than one claim results from a single wrongful act, and if claims are made during more than one 
policy period, the insured is e ntitled to the limit applicable when the first claim was made rather than the 
sum of the limits that were app licable to the policy periods du ring which all claims were made. In recent 
years, this term has replaced the term “noncumulation of limits  provision,” which has essentially the same 
meaning in both common usage and within policy forms. The relat ed claims provision is also sometimes 
referred to as the “interrelate d claims provision,” although th is usage is less common. 
Investment Company Act of 1940— A law requiring that mutual funds register with the federal 
government. The Act’s original intent was to protect the public  from many of the abuses engaged in by 
mutual funds during the 1920s, many of which were responsible f or the Wall Street Crash of 1929. On a 
more contemporary basis, the Act has assumed particular importa nce because it affords individuals who 
serve as fiduciaries of employee benefits plans a layer of insu lation from liability. Specifically, if it can be 
shown that a fiduciary selected an investment adviser who is re gistered under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, the fiduciary cannot be held liable for the invest ment adviser’s imprudent investment 
decisions. Rather, liability can only attach when it can be sho wn that the fiduciary failed to select an 
adviser who is registered under the Act. 
managed care coverage endorsement— An endorsement to a fiduciary liability policy providing 
coverage for bodily injury (BI) , property damage (PD), and pers onal injury (PI) when they result from 
administering managed care health plans. This endorsement is ne cessary because fiduciary liability 
policies usually exclude coverag e for these perils. However, be cause managed care plans are subject to 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), such cover age is necessary. The two most 
common claims involving managed care plans allege (1) that the employer-sponsor of a managed 
healthcare plan negligently select ed the managed healthcare pla n provider, and (2) that the employer-
sponsor of a managed healthcare plan wrongly denied or delayed medical benefits provided by the plan. 
occurrence policy— A policy covering claims that arise out of damage or injury tha t took place during 
the policy period, regardless of when claims are made. Most com mercial general liability (CGL) 
insurance is written on an occurrence form. 
omnibus insured wording —Policy language that reduces the potential for overlooking any  individuals, 
plans, or organizations that ar e intended to be covered under a  fiduciary liability policy. 
party-in-interest transactions— Otherwise legitimate transactions  that are prohibited under the  
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Act define s a party-in-interest as any fiduciary, 
legal counsel, employee of an employer-sponsored benefit plan, or service provider to the plan. 
Accordingly, pension plan funds cannot be used to buy or sell p roperty to or from a person who is a party-
in-interest. For example, a pension plan could not purchase sha res of stock in a company owned by a 
member of the company’s investme nt committee. ERISA provides fo r specific monetary fines and 
penalties for violations of party-in-interest rules. Fiduciary liability insurance polic ies cover the defense 
costs incurred in conjunction w ith allegations of party-in-inte rest violations; although no coverage is 
available for damages, fines, and penalties associated with suc h claims. 
Pension Protection Act of 2006— A federal law affecting major as pects of the Pension Benefit Gu aranty 
Corporation (PBGC) and defined contribution (i.e., 401(k)) plan s. The intent of the Act was twofold: (1) 
to ensure the solvency of defined benefit pension plans and (2)  to encourage employee participation in 
defined contribution/ 401(k) plans by making it easier for emplo yees to increase their retirement plan 
balances. Among the key provisions  are (1) a requirement that a  company must have in its defined benefit 
pension fund 92 percent of the money needed to meet its pension  obligations in 2008, 94 percent in 2009, 
96 percent in 2010, and 100 percent by 2011; (2) allowance of h igher dollar contribution amounts for 
401(k) savings plans, including “catch-up” contributions for ol der (i.e., 50 and up) workers; and (3) 
provisions allowing automatic enr ollment of workers in 401(k) p lans, whereby every new employee is 
automatically enrolled in the c ompany’s plan, unless the employ ee specifically opts out of enrollment. In  
119 December of 2008, however, defined  benefit plan funding require ments (item 1, above) were relaxed 
considerably, given the fact tha t the stock market had suffered  severe losses during the preceding year. 
This circumstance vastly redu ced the assets of nearly every pen sion fund in the United States, thereby 
making it nearly impossible for such plans to comply with the m ore stringent funding requirements 
originally mandated by the Act. 
prohibited transactions— Two types of transactions (invol ving employee pension and welfa re plan 
funds) that are prohibited under the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act (ERISA). These are (1) 
self-dealing and (2) party-in-interest transactions. Under the first type, fiduciaries are barred from using 
employee benefit plan assets to  profit personally, such as by i nvesting pension plan monies in a company 
in which a fiduciary holds a m ajority interest. The second type , party-in-interest transactions, are what 
would otherwise be legitimate business transactions yet are pro hibited if they are conducted with a “party-
in-interest.” The Act defines a party-in-interest as any fiduci ary, legal counsel, employee of an employer-
sponsored benefit plan, or service provider to the plan. For ex ample, pension plan funds cannot be used to 
buy or sell property to or from the family member of any truste e or anyone else who is a party-in-interest. 
In the event a fiduciary engag es in a prohibited transaction, v arious monetary penalties will be levied 
against the employer-sponsor of the plan. 
punitive damages— Damages in excess of those require d to compensate the plaintiff  for the wrong done, 
which are imposed in order to p unish the defendant because of t he particularly wanton or willful nature of 
his or her wrongdoing. Also called “exemplary damages.” Althoug h the standard commercial general 
liability (CGL) policy and business auto policy (BAP) contain n o punitive damage exclusion, many 
umbrella and excess liability polic ies contain such an exclusio n. 
retroactive date— A provision found in many (although not all) claims-made polici es that eliminates 
coverage for claims produced by wrongful acts that took place p rior to a specified date, even if the claim 
is first made during the policy period. 
For example, a January 1, 2010 , retroactive date in a policy wr itten with a January  1, 2016–2017, term 
would bar coverage for claims resulting from wrongful acts that  took place prior to January 1, 2016, even 
if claims (resulting from such acts) are made against the insur ed during the January 1, 2016–2017, policy 
period. 
There are two purposes of retroactive dates: (1) to eliminate c overage for situations or incidents known to 
insureds that have the potential to give rise to claims in the future and (2) to preclude coverage for “stale” 
claims that arise from events far in the past, even if such eve nts are unknown to the insured. In the former 
case, the retroactive date preserves the principle of “fortuity ”—that is, the insurer should not be called 
upon to cover the so-called burning building. In the latter ins tance, the retroactive date makes policies 
more affordable by precluding co verage for events that, while i nsurable, are remote in time. 
settlement programs— Programs operated by various gove rnment agencies, such as the U S Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) and the US Department of Labor (DOL), for  the purpose of resolving disputes 
without resorting to litigation. For example, employees and emp loyers can voluntarily agree to settle 
claims pertaining to employee benefit programs, using settlemen t programs. Accordingly, fiduciary 
liability insurance policies often contain specific policy prov isions and separate, additional limits that 
apply to the resolution of claim s using settlement programs. Th e purpose of this approach is to encourage 
resolution of claims under such p rograms because it is likely t o reduce total indemnity and defense costs. 
severability of interests clause— A policy provision clarifying th at, except with respect to the coverage 
limits, insurance applies to each insured as though a separate policy were issued to each. Thus, a policy 
containing such a clause will cove r a claim made by one insured  against another insured. 
   
120 statute of limitations— A law prescribing the period with in which certain types of caus es of action must 
be brought. This period usually begins to run when the injury o r damage occurs. Each state has enacted 
statutes that prescribe the peri od within which suits must be f iled that vary from claim to claim. In most 
states, the statutory time within which a plaintiff must file s uit on a bodily injury (BI) claim based on 
negligence is 2 years. For malpractice claims, the statute of l imitations may be only 1 year. Sometimes, 
courts may postpone the triggeri ng of a statute of limitation w here the plaintiff does not know about the 
claim. Applying the “discovery rule,” some courts hold that sta tutes of limitations begin running when the 
plaintiff discovers that he or she has a claim. Actions for dec laratory judgment in an insurance coverage 
matter are generally held to be go verned by the statute of limi tations for suits on written contracts, which 
vary in length from state to sta te. In Texas, for example, suit  on a written contract (including an insurance 
policy) must be filed within 4 years of the date on which one p arty breaches the agre ement, whereas in 
Ohio, such a suit may be filed at any time up to 15 years after  the breach. 
subrogation— The assignment to an insurer by te rms of the policy or by law, after payment of a loss, of 
the rights of the insured to recover the amount of the loss fro m one legally liable for it. 
vicarious liability— The liability of a principal for the acts of its agents. Vicari ous liability can result 
from the acts of independent age nts, partners, independent cont ractors, employees, and children. 
voluntary compliance fees— Payments made to correct “defi ciencies” in benefit programs ope rated by 
the insured organization
