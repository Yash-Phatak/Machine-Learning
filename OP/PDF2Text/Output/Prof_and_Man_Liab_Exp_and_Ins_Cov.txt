1 Chapter 1 
Introduction and Course Overview 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This WebCE course is designed to give a moderate ly experienced insurance person an overview of 
the legal liability exposures to which professionals (e .g., doctors, lawyers, accountants) and managers  
(e.g., directors and officers, supervisory personnel, trustees, and administrators of employee benefit 
plans) are subject. The course also offers a summary of the provisions found within the different 
insurance policies that have been designed to c over these exposures. It concludes by discussing the 
distinctive loss control, underwriting, claims ma nagement, and marketing issues pertaining to these 
coverages. 
• Chapter 2 defines the terms “professional” and “executive” as they are used within this course. It also explains why individualized policy forms are needed to cover the unique 
liability exposures generated by professionals  and executives—exposures that are usually 
excluded under commercial general liability (CGL ) policies. This chapter concludes with a 
discussion of the sources of legal liability to which professionals and executives are subject. 
• Chapter 3 affords an overview of the many diffe rent types of insurance policies required by 
professionals and executives. In some instances,  profession-specific forms are available to 
cover such professionals (e.g., policies coveri ng architects & engineers, policies covering 
corporate directors & officers). However, in other instances, certain types of professionals 
(e.g., detectives, interior decorators, auction eers, and many others) are covered by “generic” 
policy forms, also known as miscellaneou s professional liability (MPL) policy forms. 
• Chapter 4 provides a synopsis of the provis ions that are common to most types of 
professional and management liability policies.  Among the provisions discussed include: 
insuring agreements; limits, deductibles, retentions, and coinsurance; conditions; exclusions; and coverage triggers. 
• Chapter 5 explains the legal significance of a pplication forms as well as the importance of the 
information contained within application forms in determining both the price that is charged 
and the coverage terms that are offered to  professionals and executives by underwriters. 
• Chapter 6 examines specific factors that underwr iters consider when pricing professional and 
management liability policies. Such factors incl ude practice location, claim history, type of 
client, deductible/retention amount, limits, and years of professional experience.  
 
 Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
2 • Chapter 7 explains why controlling the risk s to which professionals and executives are 
exposed is crucial in making c overage available and affordable . This chapter also examines 
the actual loss control techniques that can be  applied to all types of professional and 
management liability risks, including: screeni ng new clients, committing all agreements and 
proposed services to writing, peer reviews, con tinuing education, effective client billing 
practices, and avoiding conflicts of interest. 
• Chapter 8 looks at the unique claims handling i ssues that arise when claims are made against 
professionals and executives. A number of these i ssues result from the “shrinking limit” basis 
upon which professional and management liabilit y policy forms are written. In addition, 
distinctive claim handling practices are necess itated by the fact that in negotiating claim 
settlements, professional reputations are very much at stake.  
• Chapter 9 analyzes the market structure with in which professional and management liability 
coverage is offered. The limited extent to  which professional and management liability 
policies are available, requires the use of excess and surplus lines markets, specialized 
insurance exchanges, captives, ri sk retention and risk purchasing groups, and the expertise of 
wholesalers and managing general agents, all of  which are discussed in this chapter.  
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Explain why professionals and executives requi re specialized, as opposed to standard, 
insurance policies to cover the lega l liability exposures they generate. 
1. Analyze the nature and sources of the legal lia bility to which professionals and executives are 
subject. 
2. Identify and classify the many different types of  policies available to cover the legal liability 
exposures generated by professionals and executives. 
3. Describe the key policy provisions that are common to most types of professional and 
management liability insurance policies. 
4. Understand the legal and underwriting significance of the information contained within 
applications for professional and management liability insurance.  
5. List the crucial factors used by underwriters to price coverage and determine professional and 
management liability policy terms and conditions. 
6. Identify the leading methods used to cont rol the legal liability exposures to which 
professionals and executives are subject. 
7. State and discuss the unique issues and considerations associated with the professional and management liability claims handling process. 
8. Outline and discuss the distinctive markets and sp ecialized personnel that are used in selling 
the professional and management liability insurance product. 
 
 
   
3 Chapter 2 
Introduction to Professional and Management Liability 
This introductory chapter will provide an overv iew of professional liability (PL) and management 
liability (ML), explain wh y PL and ML policies are needed, and identify and define the sources of 
legal liability for professionals and executives. 
What Is a Professional and What Is an Executive? 
To begin, it is important to define and distingui sh between the terms “professional” and “executive.” 
A professional  is a person who provides a service in accordan ce with an established set of standards, 
depending upon the particular profession. Professiona ls perform mainly mental or administrative 
work, as opposed to physical work. Such individuals normally possess a significant body of 
knowledge, derived from a combination of both form al academic study as well as practical training. 
Often, yet not always, professionals must be licensed by a formal professional body or by a state licensing board. In addition, to be an accepted memb er of many, but not all professions, the passing of 
one or more examinations is also required.  
For the purposes of this course, however, a professional will be considered anyone who requires 
coverage under a professional liab ility (PL) insurance policy because a number of liability exposures 
generated by the professional’s work is either not  covered under or is excluded by a commercial 
general liability (CGL) policy. For example, a phys ician commits an error during surgery and injures 
a patient. If the patient sues the doctor, a professional liability policy is require d to cover his or her 
liability, since this exposure is excluded by a CGL policy form. 
Although an executive  is often considered to be the head of a governmental body (such as a 
president), for the purposes of this course, the term applies to persons who perform executive, 
managerial, or supervisory functions within a busin ess, at both for-profit and nonprofit firms. (The 
term will also apply to persons who serve on boards of directors at such organizations.) If, for 
example, a corporation’s chief executive officer (CEO) is negligent in managing the firm’s finances, no coverage will be available for the CEO under th e corporation’s CGL policy if stockholders sue 
him. Rather, coverage is provide d for under a directors and officers (D&O) liability policy for this 
type of claim. D&O liability policies are one of sev eral types of management liability coverage that 
will be examined in this course. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
4 The Need for Professional and Ma nagement Liability Insurance 
Policies 
The need for PL and ML insurance coverage arises from four sources: (1)  commercial general 
liability (CGL) insurance policies do not cover economic/financial injury, the major exposure 
generated by professionals and executives; (2) covera ge for most types of professional activities is 
specifically excluded by standard exclusionary endor sements that are routinely attached to the CGL 
policy forms written to cover professionals a nd executives; (3) CGL policy forms for most 
professionals are also written with what is known as a Designated Professional Services Exclusion, 
yet another  means of  eliminating coverage fo r the professional services they provide; and (4) both 
businessowners policies (BOPs) and homeowners policies do not cover PL or  ML exposures.  
CGL Policies do not Cover Economic and Financial Injury 
CGL insurance policies cover four types of perils: (1) bodily injury, (2) property damage, (3) personal 
injury (e.g., invasion of privacy, libel, false arrest, slander), and (4) advertising injury (e.g., copyright 
infringement, misappropriation of advertising ideas). The problem with this approach, as respects PL 
and ML exposures, is that it leaves uncovered the most significant exposure generated by these risks. 
Specifically, the largest exposure for the typical business executive or professional does not  fall 
within any of these four categories of coverage . Rather, the major exposure generated by business 
executives and professionals is liability produced by financial  or economic injury  alleged by third 
parties and clients.  
Admittedly, there are a handful of professionals who do  have an exposure to the four perils indicated 
above, notably: physicians (bodily injury), architects & engineers (bodily injury and property 
damage), police (personal injury and bodily inju ry) and various media businesses (advertising injury). 
However, CGL policies written for such risks always contain either standard exclusionary endorsements exclusions or are written with a Designated Professional Services Exclusion.  
What is Economic and Financial Injury?  
Economic and financial injury refers to losses that do not fall into one of the four categories of losses covered by a CGL policy as noted above. Such injury usually produces monetary losses but not 
necessarily as a result of bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, or advertising injury . The 
following examples illustrate the nature of the ec onomic/financial injury exposure inherent in 
professional activities and in the functions of business executives.  
Scenario One (Professional Liability) 
An attorney handling an auto liab ility injury case fails to file the claim prior to expiration of the 3-
year statute of limitations. The client, who suffered serious injuries, sues the attorney for negligently 
missing the filing deadline and alleges a $2 million loss because he is now unable to pursue a claim 
against the drunk driver who caused the accident.     
Scenario Two (Management Liability) 
The chief financial officer (CFO) of a publicly traded  corporation intentionally conceals the fact that 
the organization has lost $50 million during the latest  fiscal year. The concealment is revealed by an 
audit a year later. Following a public announcement of the loss, the corporation’s stock price drops 
from $50 per share to $5 per share. Stockholders sue the corporation’s board of directors for the loss in value of their shares in the company.  Chapter 2—Introduction to Profe ssional and Management Liability 
5 Since the attorney’s client and the stockholders, respectively, did not suffer bodily injury, property 
damage, personal injury, or advertising injury, as a di rect result of the lawyer’s/board of directors’ 
conduct under the two scenarios, there would be no coverage for these claims under a CGL policy 
written for either the lawyer or the corporation. 
Professional Liability Exclusions for Specific Professions within CGL Policy 
Forms 
The second reason why PL and ML insurance is ne eded is that CGL underwriters routinely add 
exclusionary endorsements to policies written for insureds in businesses presenting PL and ML  exposures. Exhibit 2.1 lists those rating classification codes that call for PL and  ML exclusionary endorsements.

The Designated Professional Services Ex clusionary Endorsement (CG 21 16) 
The Designated Professional Services Exclusionary  Endorsement, CG 21 16, that functions as a 
“catchall” exclusion of professional liability exposures, is used by underwriters to preclude coverage 
for professional activities for which no standard professional liability exclusion exists. For example, 
since no specific exclusion exists for attorneys, a CGL underwriter would be very likely to attach the 
Designated Professional Services Exclusionary En dorsement to a CGL policy written to cover a 
lawyer. The endorsement consists of a schedule noted as “Description of Professional Services,” 
under which the underwriter lists the services for wh ich coverage will be excluded under the CGL 
policy. 
No Coverage under BOP or Homeowners Policies 
As noted above, BOP and homeowners policies also  do not cover PL/ML exposures. This is despite 
the fact that, increasingly, people are operating businesses out of their homes as well as the fact that 
BOP policy eligibility has been expanding to many mo re types of businesses than in the past. (BOP 
policies are package policies for which certain ty pes of small businesses qualify; the policies combine 
property, general liability, auto liability, and sev eral other coverages within a single form.) Chapter 2—Introduction to Profe ssional and Management Liability 
9 In summary, the need for PL and ML  insurance policies is driven by  the fact that: (1) CGL forms do 
not cover economic and financial injury, the prin cipal exposure of professionals and executives; (2) 
CGL underwriters routinely attach standard prof essional liability exclusionary endorsements to 
policies written for such risks; (3) in cases where a PL or ML exposure is not addressed by a standard 
exclusionary endorsement, underwriters attach a Designated Professional Services Exclusion; and (4) 
PL and ML coverage is absent from BOP and homeowners policy forms. 
Legal Sources of Professional Liab ility and Management Liability 
The legal liability of professionals arises from two major sources: (1) tort and (2) contract. Tort claims are the more commonly alleged cause of action against professionals and executives than are 
contract claims. 
Tort Liability 
Tort liability is a civil wrong that gives rise to le gal liability and ultimately, payment of monetary 
damages. (In contrast, criminal liability gives rise to imprisonment and/or the payment of fines or penalties.)  When a claim alleging tort liability is  made against a professional or executive, it means 
that the professional or executive was negligent  in performing specific services. Negligence is the 
failure to use a degree of care considered reas onable by a comparable professional or executive under 
similar circumstances. Acts of omission or commission may constitute negligence. 
Elements of a Tort (Negligence) Claim  
To recover under a cause of action for negligence, a claimant must prove the following elements.  
1. The professional/executive had a legal duty to conform to a certain standard of conduct. The purpose of this standard is to protect others against harm. This is what is referred to as the “duty” element of the cause of action. For instance, when handling a criminal case, a lawyer has a legal duty to thoroughly investigate th e facts and circumstances surrounding that case. 
2. The professional failed to conform to this standard, which is another way of saying that the 
professional/executive breached his/her legal duty to the claimant. This  is the “negligence” 
element of the cause of action.  Continuing with the above example, the lawyer’s failure to 
perform the investigation prevented him from discovering a witness who could state that the 
attorney’s client did not commit the murder of which he is accused.  
3. There must be a close causal connection betw een the conduct and the resulting injury. This 
element is known as “proximate cause.” In this ex ample, the attorney’s failure to investigate 
the circumstances resulted in his client being convicted of a murder he did not commit.  
4. The claimant must suffer damage as a result of the professional’s/executive’s act or omission. This is the “damages” element of a tort claim. As a direct result of the attorney’s failure to 
discover the witness whose testimony would ha ve absolved his client, the client was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
The Professional St andard of Care 
In an “ordinary” negligence action (e.g., a motor vehicle accident), the standard applied is that of the “reasonable person”; that is, a person must exerci se the care that a reasonable person would have 
exercised under similar circumstances. In contrast, in a claim against a professional or executive, such 
a person, due to his or her superior knowledge and skill, must act with the care commensurate of a reasonable member of his or her profession, to a void potential liability. A classic statement of the Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
10 professional standard of care is that one who undertakes to render services in the practice of a 
profession is required to exercise the skill and knowledge normally possessed by members of that 
profession in good standing in similar communities.  
Errors in Professional Judgment 
Because the professional is expected to possess special knowledge and skills accumulated through 
education, training, and experience beyond that of the ordinary pers on, the professional is usually not 
liable for errors in judgment, so long as the pr ofessional’s course of action was “accepted” practice 
and if the professional used reasonable care in undertaking the course of conduct. For example, a doctor is not negligent simply because his or her efforts prove unsuccessful. The fact that a doctor 
may have chosen a specific method of treatment  that later proves to be unsuccessful does not 
necessarily constitute negligence that will give rise to liability—provided the treatment chosen was a 
standard treatment, accepted within  the practice of medicine, and was undertaken on the basis of the 
information available to the doctor at the time a c hoice had to be made. On the other hand, a doctor 
must use reasonable care to obtain the informa tion needed to exercise his or her professional 
judgment. Therefore, an unsuccessful method of tr eatment chosen because of a failure to use such 
reasonable care would be considered negligence.  
Sources of Standards for Professional Conduct 
There are several sources that contribute to the establishment of the standards against which the 
conduct of professionals is measured. These sources in clude: (1) the particular codes of conduct and 
ethics within a profession, (2) statutes and regula tions, (3) customary practices within a profession, 
and (4) practices within small niches of the profession created by specialization. 
Codes of Professional Conduct and Ethics 
In the legal profession, the Model Rules of Prof essional Conduct, promulgated by the American Bar 
Association in 1983, provide a model upon which many  state bar associations have based their codes 
of professional conduct. Typically, these codes impose ethical standards governing matters such as: preservation of client confidences, conflicts of interest, and demean or of attorneys when litigating 
cases. Likewise, the medical profession has similar rules that govern the preservation of patient confidences by means of the physician-patient priv ilege, as well as other aspects of the physician-
patient relationship. Practices of accountants ar e governed by statements and opinions of the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), as well as prior statements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). These accounting standards and guidelines are given 
substantial weight in determining whether an accountant has met the performance standards of his or her profession. 
Statutes and Regulations 
Statutes and regulations also affect the standard of care in a particular profession. Many statutes and 
regulations have been enacted to regulate physicia ns and other health care providers. For example, 
state hospital regulations and national hospital accred itation standards have been admitted in evidence 
by courts to aid the jury in deciding a hospital’s lia bility for malpractice. Many of the statutory acts 
governing the medical profession were passed as a resu lt of the wave of tort reform in the 1980s and 
1990s. The statutes were enacted as a result of the lobbying efforts of the medical community and their malpractice insurers who were reacting to the dramatic increase in the amount of premiums for 
malpractice coverage.  Chapter 2—Introduction to Profe ssional and Management Liability 
11 Customary Practices within the Profession 
Another factor contributing to the establishment of the standard of care is the customary practices of 
members of the profession. For instance, the standard of care for attorneys is governed in part by the 
customary practices of the profession. Accordingly, one of the duties of an attorney is to adequately 
research the status of the law for his or her clie nts. A professional’s deviation from his or her own 
usual customs and practices will likely provide strong evidence of professional negligence on a 
particular matter. For example, an architectural firm may maintain an in-house manual of practice 
setting out guidelines to be used by those architect s in designing their projects. Any failure to follow 
such guidelines could be used to support allegations of negligence. 
Specialization as a Source of Liability 
Specialization within the medical profession h as been the norm for quite some time. Where a 
professional holds himself out as a specialist in certain areas of practice, he or she is required to have 
the skill and knowledge common to other specialists  in that area. Thus, specialization creates a 
particularized standard of care applicable to that specialty. Moreover, where a general practitioner in the legal profession determines that a client’s case is  beyond his expertise, he or she owes a duty to 
refer the client to an appropriate specialist.   
Contract Liability 
Historically, causes of action against professionals  were based upon breach of contract. Currently, 
however, claims alleging breach of contract are much less common than are tort claims. 
To successfully maintain a breach of contract action against a professional, the claimant must prove: 
1. The existence of a contract, oral or written, between the plaintiff and the professional;  
2. That the contract was breached by the professional;  
3. That the plaintiff suffered damages; and  
4. That the plaintiff's damages were caused by the professional's breach of contract.  
Because some professionals use contracts to define the scope of the services to be performed for their 
clients more often than others, those professionals  may be more frequently subjected to causes of 
action for breach of those contracts. Professionals extensively using contracts or engagement letters 
include architects, engineers, accountants, and, to a growing extent, attorneys. 
Defenses to Professional Liability Claims 
Of course, the defendant professional has various de fenses to a claim alleging either negligence or 
breach of contract, including the following. 
• Statute of limitations 
• Assumption of risk 
• Failure of the client to fully disclose all information 
• Failure to comply with the professional’s instructions or advice   
• Contributory or comparative negligence 
• Written consent by a patient absolving a professional from liability Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
12 Statute of Limitations 
One of the most frequently asserted defenses to allega tions of negligence or breach of contract is one 
based on the statute of limitations. Typically, statutes provide that a professional liability claimant has 
a specific number of years to file a lawsuit against the members of a particular profession, beginning 
on the date the cause of action accrues. However, the major difficulty with applying a statute of 
limitations defense is the determination of when the cause of action accrues, i.e., the date from which 
the limitations period begins to run. 
If a court determines that the plaintiff should have reasonably discovered his or her injury at an earlier 
date, the cause of action would accrue on that date  and his or her cause of action could possibly be 
barred by a statute of limitations. However, in the event the professional fraudulently concealed the 
injury, statutes of limitation will not begin to run until the client learns of facts, conditions, or 
circumstances that would cause a reasonably pruden t person to make an inquiry that, if pursued, 
would lead to the discovery of the concealed cause of action.  The statute of limitations can be “modified” under certain circumstances by means of two other legal 
doctrines: (1) the discovery rule and (2 ) the continuing undertaking rule.  
The Discovery Rule 
In the medical profession particularly, one of the doctrines that has emerged in determining when a 
cause of action accrues is the “discovery rule.” U nder this rule, where the plaintiff has not had a 
reasonable opportunity to discover the injury arising out of the alleged malpractice, the cause of action does not accrue until the date the plaintiff di scovers, or should have r easonably discovered, the 
injury. The rationale behind this rule is that a pa tient may be unaware of an injury until a significant 
period of time after the actual act giving rise to the injury is committed by the doctor (e.g., it may be a year before a surgical patient discovers that a doctor left a sponge in his stomach during an 
operation).  
Continuing Undertaking Rule 
Statutes of limitations have been “tolled” (i.e., te mporarily stopped from running) while the allegedly 
negligent professional services are ongoing, by what is known as the “continuing undertaking rule.” 
For example, the statute of limitations in a me dical malpractice action will be tolled under this 
doctrine where a physician's negligence consists of a series of negligent acts or continuing course of improper treatment. That is, where the doctor h as a duty of continuing treatment and care, the 
limitations period does not begin to run until treatment by the doctor for the particular disease or condition has terminated—unless during the course of treatment, the patient learns or should have 
learned of negligence. In that case, the statute runs  from the time of discovery, actual (i.e., when the 
patient did learn of his/her injury) or constructive (i.e., when the patient had all of the information required to discover his/her injury and therefore should have been able to discover it). Likewise, in a legal malpractice action, the “continuous representatio n rule” may apply. Under that rule, the statute 
of limitations is tolled—or the accrual of the cause of action against the attorney is deferred—while the attorney continues to represent the client and th e representation relates to the same transaction or 
subject matter as the allegedly negligent acts.  
Assumption of Risk  
This defense refers to a situation where a client willingly assumes certain risks inherent in a specific professional service or treatment. If a patient was fully informed about the dangers of an operation, he or she is considered to be aware of the possibl e unexpected results, and assumes the risk of such Chapter 2—Introduction to Profe ssional and Management Liability 
13 results. For example, if a patient is advised that  there is a 1 in 25 chance that he will suffer 
complications following bariatric (i.e., stomach stapling) surgery, his assent to the operation can be 
considered an assumption of risk.   
Failure of the Client To Fully Disclose All Information 
A client’s failure to completely disclose all rele vant facts about his case or treatment can provide a 
defense to a claim against a professional. For exampl e, the failure of a patient to fully reveal all 
information to a doctor, such as a complete medical history, present complaints, and previous treatments, may relieve a doctor from re sponsibility for an unfavorable result.  
Failure To Comply with the Professi onal's Instructions or Advice   
If a patient, following an operation, engages in  strenuous activity—despite a doctor’s prohibition 
against such activity—and the activity worsens his or her condition, the physician may be absolved from liability.  
Contributory or Comp arative Negligence 
Continuing the previous example, contributory or comparative negligence would include failure to return for follow-up treatment, for example.  
Written Consent by a Patient Abso lving a Professional from Liability 
If, prior to a risky operation, a patient signs a form waiving liability against a doctor, such an 
agreement could absolve the physician from liability. 
Expanding Areas of Professional Liability 
There has been a dramatic increase in the potential liabilities to which for professionals have been subject in recent years. These areas include: (1) liabi lity to third-parties, (2) liability as a “deep 
pocket,” and (3) heightened standards to wh ich nontraditional professionals are being held. 
Liability to Third Parties 
The traditional rule was that privity was required for a plaintiff to maintain a cause of action against a professional for liability arising out of the prof essional’s actions. Privity means that a direct 
contractual relationship exists be tween two parties, such as when Accounting Firm X enters into a 
contract to audit Corporation Y’s financial statem ents. In contrast, investors in Corporation Y, 
although they may have relied on Accounting Firm X’ s audit, are not in privity of contract with 
Accounting Firm X. 
 However, as will be noted below, this doctrine is being eroded. 
Limitations upon the Privity Doctrine 
Many states have limited the scope of the privity doctrine and are now holding professionals liable to 
third parties with whom they do not have a cont ractual relationship. For example, under the privity 
rule, if an accountant prepares financial statements  that misrepresent the financial condition of a 
company, the accountant cannot be held liable to lend ers or investors who relied upon the truth of the 
financial statements because the accountant did not ha ve a contractual relationship with such parties. 
However, in recent years, courts have held professi onals liable to such third parties in situations 
where their reliance on the work of professionals was foreseeable. In other words, if an accountant Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
14 was fairly sure that lenders or investors would be relying on the results of the accountant’s audit of a 
client company, the accountant could still be held liable, despite the lack of a direct contractual 
relationship with the lenders or investors.  
Negligent Failure to Warn 
Similarly, professionals are increasingly being held li able to third parties in situations where they 
have been found to have been negligent in failing to warn such third parties in certain situations. For 
instance, a health care provider has a duty to warn others once he or she knows that a patient poses a 
serious threat of violence to a readily identifiable individual or group of individuals.  
The Professional as “Deep Pocket” 
One of the obvious undercurrents in the amount of  litigation against professionals, whether they be 
attorneys, executives, accountants, or architects, is that these providers of professional services are 
perhaps the only “deep pocket” against which recove ry may be sought. Accordingly, lawsuits against 
professionals are often viewed as a means to tap the professional liability insurance coverage they maintain. For example, in the case of architects, a disgruntled owner of a defective building will 
typically sue all parties involved on the project, including the general contractor, subcontractors, the architect, and engineers. Frequently, the actual ne gligent party may be insolvent or will have no 
insurance coverage for the particular problem, such as its own defective work. In that instance, the 
architect—and his or her presumably “deep pocke t”—is added to the lawsuit despite having 
committed no negligence in causing the loss. This is also true of hospitals when patients, despite 
being injured by the sole negligence of an independ ent contractor physician, also name the hospital in 
their lawsuits. 
Imposition of Rigorous Performance Standar ds on Skilled Service Providers   
Errors and omissions liability has also undergone a tremendous expansion in recent years, and now 
has been held to apply to specially skilled occ upations, in addition to traditional professionals. In 
effect, there appears to be an increasing app lication of professional liability standards to 
nontraditional professional service providers. Of late, the law has evolved to the point where one who 
undertakes to render services in the practice of a service or a trade is required to exercise the skill and knowledge normally possessed by members providing that service or trade, in good standing in 
similar communities. For example, in one case, a karate instructor’s conduct was evaluated against 
this standard.

17 Chapter 3 
Types of Professional and Management Liability Insurance Coverage 
There are three broad categories within which PL and ML insurance coverage can be classified: (1) 
management liability insurance, (2) medical prof essional liability insurance, and (3) non-medical 
professional liability insurance. Brief discussions  of each of these classifications, as well as the 
specific types of insurance cove rage within them, follow.  
Management liability Insurance 
There are  three specific types of management liability insurance coverage: (1) directors and officers  (D&O) liability insurance, (2) fiduciary liability in surance, and (3) employment practices liability 
insurance (EPLI).  In addition, this course will very briefly address kidnap ransom (KR) insurance 
(also referred to as  special crime insurance),  although it is not always classified as a type of management liability coverage. This  is because KR insurance is not a form of liability insurance. 
However, it is frequently offered in a packag ed format along with D&O, fiduciary, and EPLI 
coverage because, as will be explained below, KR insurance does protect managers.  
Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability Insurance 
The directors of a corporation owe a duty to shareholders to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders’ best interest. The directors are responsible for determining the corporation’s business strategy and appointing and supervising o fficers to execute that strategy. Because they 
appoint and supervise the corporate officers who carry out the day-to-day management of the 
corporation, the directors serve as a link betw een shareholders and management. D&O liability 
insurance is designed to cover claims alleging the breach of these duties by a corporation’s directors 
and officers and in effect, functions as errors and omissions coverage for such persons. Directors and 
officers incur liability when they br each these duties owed to: (1) sharehol ders and (2) “other” parties.  
Liability to Shareholders 
In the event that the directors and officers breach th ese duties, they can be subject to lawsuits by 
shareholders of the corporation. For example, the directors and officers of Company X decide to acquire a subsidiary. Subsequently, the subsidia ry loses significant sums of money, and the 
shareholders of Company X bring a lawsuit against the directors and officers, alleging a lack of due 
care prior to making the decision to purchase the now-floundering subsidiary.   Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
18 Liability to Other Parties 
In addition to shareholders, directors and offi cers can be sued by competitors, employees, and 
government regulators, for failing to properly execute their duties in managing the corporation. For 
example, a competitor could sue a company’s directors and officers, alleging that they 
misappropriated certain trade secrets. An employee could sue the directors and officers, claiming to 
have been wrongfully terminated. Government regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and 
Exchange Commission could sue the directors and o fficers, alleging that they falsified a stock 
registration statement, when the company began offering stock to the public. 
Fiduciary Liability Insurance 
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (E RISA) was passed in 1974 to assure that 
employees participating in pension and benefit plans would indeed receive the benefits promised by such programs. According to ERISA, an individual is considered a fiduciary if that person exercises 
any discretionary authority over, or has control in, managing an employee benefit plan or its assets. 
Fiduciary liability insurance is d esigned to cover claims alleging the breach of these duties. The next 
two paragraphs will explain: (1) what types of persons and institutions are considered fiduciaries and 
(2) what types of claims are made against them.   
Persons and Institutions Considered To Be Fiduciaries 
The following individuals and entities can be held  liable under ERISA: (1) persons working within 
corporations who administer benefit and pensi on plans; (2) persons working within business 
organizations (outside of the client company) that design, administer, and manage pension and 
employee benefit plans, on behalf of client comp anies; (3)  financial institutions (e.g., banks, 
insurance companies) who hold the assets of such plans in their care or custody; and (4) individuals 
(e.g., attorneys, actuaries, consultants, investment advisers) who perform services in conjunction with 
the pension and employee benefit plans of client companies. 
Potential Claims against Fiduciaries 
The following scenario provides an example of how a number of persons and institutions could be held liable for the insolvency of a corporate pension plan. The actuary who designed the plan could 
face liability when the plan is unable to pay promised benefits, based upon allegations that the 
actuary’s funding recommendations were inadequate to maintain promised benefits. The bank that 
holds some of the pension’s funds could be held lia ble if the bank’s insolvency caused pensioners to 
be denied promised payments. The investment advisor of the pension plan could be sued if his 
recommended investments failed to generate sufficien t returns to assure promised benefit payments. 
The trustees at the corporation that sponsored the pension plan could be sued for negligence in selecting the incompetent actuary an d investment advisor, and for choosing a financially unstable 
bank to hold the plan’s assets.  
Employment Practices Liability Insurance 
Beginning in the early 1990s, CGL policy forms began adding blanket, exclusionary endorsements that precluded coverage for employment-related cl aims made by both: (1) employees and (2) third 
parties (such as a company’s customers, vendors and suppliers). As a result of this change, coupled 
with a sharp increase in employment-related litigation, employment practices liability (EPL) 
insurance policies were introduced to cover this exposure.  
 Chapter 3—Types of Professional a nd Management Liability Coverage 
19 Corporate and Individual Liability 
For-profit corporations, government entities, and no nprofit organizations of all kinds face exposures 
to claims from employees who allege: discrimina tion, wrongful termination, sexual harassment 
(although legally, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination), retaliation (e.g., an employee is 
fired in response to filing a workers compensation claim or for reporting misconduct to a 
governmental regulator), and various other workplace torts (e.g., invasion of privacy, defamation, failure to promote, failure to grant tenure). Not only can these entities be held liable for such claims, 
but their directors, officers, managers, supervisors,  and employees can also be sued for damages that 
result from employment-related allegations.  
Third-Party Liability 
As noted above, in addition to employees, third pa rties (mainly customers, clients, and vendors) of 
these entities can also allege discrimination or sexua l harassment. For example, customers of Denny’s 
and Cracker Barrel restaurants, as well as patrons  of the Adam’s Mark Hotels (among other 
corporations), have received significan t settlements based on these allegations. 
Types of EPL Coverage 
EPL insurance can be purchased in one of three ways: (1) as a “stand-alone” policy that only covers employment practices liability, (2) as an endorsement to a D&O liability policy, and (3) as part of a 
management liability package policy that also pr ovides D&O and fiduciary liability coverage.   
Kidnap Ransom Insurance 
Corporate executives and managers are faced with th e exposure of being kidnapped and then held for 
ransom. The threat of kidnap is especially acute  when these executives and managers are located 
outside of the United States. In response, insure rs offer what is known as kidnap ransom (KR) 
insurance, a type of coverage also referred to  as “special crime insurance.” This coverage can 
sometimes be purchased as an endorsement to a D&O liability policy, as well as on a stand-alone 
basis, and at times, as a coverage option w ithin a management liability package policy.  
In addition to covering specific ra nsom demands (subject to policy limits), KR insurance also covers 
the cost of two other important services: (1) hiri ng specially trained hosta ge negotiators who are 
skilled at arranging the return of  kidnapped executives, and (2) prov iding expert security consulting 
services, aimed at preventing such incidents.  
Medical Professional Liability Insurance  
There are five specific types of medical professi onal liability insurance c overage: (1) physicians 
professional liability, (2) hospital professional lia bility (HPL), (3) allied healthcare professional 
liability, (4) nursing home liability insurance, and (5) managed care organization (MCO) liability 
insurance. One key point to recognize regarding all five types of medical professional liability 
insurance coverage is that unlike management liability policies and policies written to cover non-
medical professionals, medical professional liability insurance does not exclude bodily injury and property damage.   
 
 Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
20 Physicians Professional Liability Insurance 
Doctors can be held legally liable to their pa tients when they suffer injuries resulting from:  
• Misdiagnosis/failure to diagno se, inappropriate treatment,  
• Delay in treatment,  
• Failure to treat,  
• Injuries from therapeutic agents,  
• Injuries from equipment and premises,  
• Failure to admit/inappropriate discharge, and  
• Intentional torts (e.g., assault, inv asion of privacy, sexual misconduct).  
Physicians professional liability insurance, also  known as “medical malpr actice insurance,” was 
designed to cover these exposures. 
Hospital Professional Liability Insurance 
In addition to the claim allegations that can be made against physicians, the following acts of 
negligence can also be made against hospitals.  
• Failure to admit to a hospital/inappropriate discharge 
• Failure to monitor or observe 
• Failure to notify appropria te physicians or seek a ppropriate consultations 
• Failure to prevent falls or other self-inflicted injury 
• Failure to hire qualified personnel 
• Failure to use care in credentialing physi cians or allied health care professionals 
• Failure to adequately supervise personnel 
• Failure to staff adequately, and  
• Failure to promulgate appropria te policies and procedures.  
Hospital professional liability (HPL) insuran ce was designed to cover these exposures.  
Allied Health Care Liability Insurance 
A broad range of non-hospital/non-physician medical practitioners and facilities have been termed “allied health care professionals,” by the insurance industry. The two major classes of risks that fall 
within the scope of allied health care professionals  insurance are institutions and individuals. The 
former consists of entities such as testing labs , day surgery centers, blood banks, and ambulance 
services. The latter is composed of specific professional occupations such as emergency medical technicians, psychologists, podiatrists, nurses, and physical therapists. The number of new specialties 
in the medical field is rapidly increasing, and add itional allied health care professions and types of 
specialized institutions continue to emerge. Allie d health care liability insurance was designed to 
cover these exposures.  
  Chapter 3—Types of Professional a nd Management Liability Coverage 
21 Legal Duties and Types of Claims Applicable to Allied Health Care Risks 
Although they engage in different professional activities, allied health care professionals and 
institutions are subject to most of the same co mmon law and statutory standards of professional 
conduct as are physicians and hosp itals. Moreover, they are exposed to many of the same claim 
allegations to which identi cal legal defenses apply.  
Nursing Home Liability Insurance 
Nursing home liability insurance covers the liability exposures of facilities that provide medical, 
nursing, custodial, social, and community servi ces over an extended period of time. These services 
are designed to help people with chronic health impairments or forms of dementia who may not be 
able to perform normal daily activities, such as eating, bathing, using the bathroom, or taking 
medication, without assistance. Nursing home liability insurance contains many of the same coverage 
elements as are provided by physicians, HPL, a nd allied health care professional liability insurance 
policies. This is because nursing homes share many of  the same premises and operations exposures as 
hospitals. In addition, nursing homes typically  employ a broad range of allied health care 
professionals such as nurses and physical therap ists, as well as physicians who serve as what are 
known as “medical directors” in these institutions.  
Managed Care Organization Liability Insurance 
Managed care organization (MCO) liability insuranc e covers organizations engaged in delivering 
medical services on a managed-care basis, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and 
preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Representative types of claims covered by the policies include allegations of:  negligent provider selec tion, direct professional liability (i.e., when the 
HMO’s employ physicians), and wrongful denial of  treatment based upon financial considerations. 
Non-Medical Professional Liability Insurance 
There are five specific types of non-medical professi onal liability insurance. Such categories include 
coverage for: (1) “traditional” professionals, (2) errors and omissions (E&O) liability, (3) media 
liability, (4) public entity liability, and (5) mi scellaneous liability.  
Coverage for “Traditional” Professionals 
Within this category of non-medical professional liability insurance includ es policies for lawyers, 
accountants, and architects & engineers. 
Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance 
These policies provide attorneys with liability coverage for financial loss suffered mainly (but not solely), by clients, arising from acts, errors, a nd omissions in providing pr ofessional, legal services.  
Unlike a number of other types of professional liab ility coverage, the polici es provide coverage for 
personal injury perils (i.e., defamation, invasion of privacy) since allegations of such acts occur 
frequently in the legal arena. The two main class es of claims against attorneys involve those from 
either (1) litigation or (2) non-litigation services. Anot her way to “group” claims against attorneys is 
by type of legal error: (1) administrative (e.g., fa ilure to file a claim prior to statute of limitation 
expiration), (2) substantive (e.g. as a result of  his lawyer’s failure to search a public record, a client 
purchases real estate with a defective title), (3) clie nt relations (e.g., failure  to obtain a client’s 
consent prior to settling a claim in which the client  was injured in an automobile accident), and (4) Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
22 intentional wrongdoing (e.g., filing an intentionally baseless lawsuit, solely for the purpose of 
harassment). 
Accountants Professional Liability Insurance 
These policies provide coverage for financial loss resulting from the delivery of professional 
accounting services. As is true of lawyers’ prof essional liability insurance, accountants professional 
liability policies exclude coverage for fraud, inte ntional acts, criminal acts, bodily injury, and 
property damage. In recent years, claims pertaining to audits have been those with the highest loss severity, while claims made in conjunction with tax preparation constitute the most frequent type of 
professional liability claim made against accountants. In addition, as the scope of services provided by accountants has branched out into related ar eas, claims involving consulting, also known as 
“management advisory services,” have also increased . Coverage for higher risk and niche activities, 
such as advisory investment services and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) work is available by endorsement. 
Architects and Engineers Prof essional Liability Insurance 
These policies cover individuals involved in design ing or preparing plans and specifications for 
construction projects. “Architects and engineers prof essional liability” coverage is also referred to as 
“design professional liability insurance,” and covers  claims involving three functional areas: (1) 
design, (2) management (i.e., construction project supervision), and (3) payment authorization (i.e., 
approving payment to contractors for completed work). Unlike virtually all management liability 
policies and policies written to cover non-medi cal professionals (but like medical professional 
liability insurance policies), architects and engineers professional liability insurance does not exclude 
bodily injury and property damage. The reason for this is fairly obvious, since by far, an architect or 
engineer’s greatest exposure to liability is that an  error in design causes a defective building to be 
constructed, which, in turn, results in bodily inju ry to persons in or near the structure, as well as 
property damages to the structure itself.  
Errors and Omissions (E&O) Liability Coverage 
This category of non-medical professional liability in surance includes coverage for insurance agents 
and brokers, real estate brokers, technology professi onals, and coverage for exposures generated by 
intellectual property.    
Insurance Agents Errors and Omissions Insurance 
These policies cover claims resulting from errors a nd omissions caused by insurance agents and 
brokers. The two major classes of claimants are clients and insurers. Among the most common 
allegations made by clients are failure to place c overage promptly, failure to place the type of 
coverage requested, failure to increase the coverage  limit, failure to recommend needed coverage, 
failure to explain limitations of coverage, verbal extensions of nonexistent coverage, inadvertent 
cancellation or failure to renew, and failure to pl ace coverage with a solvent insurer. Among the most 
common allegations made by insurers against insu rance agents and brokers are failure to follow 
underwriting guidelines, failure to exercise reasonabl e diligence in discharging duties to the insurer, 
failure to act in the best interest s of the insurer, failure to revise coverage on request, failure to cancel 
on request, failure to disclose material informati on about an insured or applicant, and exceeding 
underwriting authority.   Chapter 3—Types of Professional a nd Management Liability Coverage 
23 Real Estate Brokers Erro rs and Omissions Insurance 
These policies cover people engaged in buying, selling, leasing, or othe rwise dealing in real estate on 
behalf of others. Depending on the scope of the act ual policy, coverage may also apply to persons 
working in property management, real estate appraisal , real estate consulting, or other related aspects 
of the business, although coverage for these, more  specialized exposures usually requires a special 
endorsement to a standard real estate brokers policy form. Typical claim allegations against real estate 
brokers for which coverage is afforded under the policies include misrepresentations about creative 
financing arrangements, failure to reveal important information about the surrounding physical 
features of a property, failure to ascertain title prob lems, failure to advise a buyer/seller that he/she 
can get a better price, negligence in screening pr ospective tenants who end up in bankruptcy or do 
damage to leased premises, and appraisal errors that produce inaccurate valuations.  
Technology Errors and Omissions Insurance 
These policies cover two types of companies: those that (1) sell tech-related products and (2) those 
that provide tech-related services to third parti es. Examples of the kinds of firms that require 
technology E&O coverage include computer hardware /software installers; Internet service providers; 
computer leasing companies; software develope rs; technology consultants; and manufacturers of 
electronic components, accessories, consumer electronics, and office equipment.  
The policies cover five major types of exposures. Each of these exposures involves a third party 
sustaining a loss (financial, personal injury, or both) , for which an insured technology professional is 
potentially liable. These losses include the following.  
• Errors or omissions : loss caused by an act, error, or omission committed by the insured 
technology professional while performing services for another.  
• Product failure : loss caused by the failure of the insu red technology professional’s product or 
service to perform as intended or promised.  
• Security failure : loss caused by failure on the part of  the insured technology professional to 
prevent unauthorized access to an online system.   
• Professional liability : loss caused by the insured technology professional’s infringement of 
copyright, trademark, or trade dress. 
• Personal injury : loss caused by the insured technology professional’s acts, errors, or 
omissions while supplying a product or providing a service, such as defamation or invasion of privacy.  
Intellectual Property Insurance 
Intellectual property refers to creations of the mi nd, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; 
inventions; and symbols, names, images, and d esigns used in commerce, including copyrights, 
trademarks, patents, and related rights. Under in tellectual property law, th e holder of one of these 
abstract “properties” has certain exclusive right s to the creative work, commercial symbol, or 
invention which is covered by it. There are two basi c types of “IP coverage.” (1)  Intellectual property 
defense cost reimbursement insurance reimburses insureds for legal expenses incurred to defend 
against lawsuits alleging that the insured has committ ed patent, trademark, or copyright infringement. 
Since the purpose of the policy is to pay defen se costs only, there is no coverage for damages 
awarded against the insured if it is found that the in sured, in fact, infringed upon another's intellectual 
property. This approach is unique to IP coverage , since virtually every other type of PL and ML Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
24 policy also covers damages (i.e., settlements and judg ments) as well as defense costs. (2) Intellectual 
property infringement abatement insurance covers insureds for legal expenses incurred when an 
insured enforces a patent, trademark, or copyright against infringers. Since the purpose of the policy 
is to pay legal costs required to enforce intellectua l property rights, there is no coverage for damages 
suffered by the insured that result from the infringeme nt (e.g., lost profits because a valid patent was 
infringed upon by a competitor).  
Media Liability Coverage 
Within this category of non-medical professional lia bility insurance is covera ge for: (1) traditional 
media and (2) non-traditional media. 
Traditional media liability refers to nonelectronic media and c overs the liability exposures of such 
businesses and individuals as advertisers; authors;  book, magazine, and music publishers; cable 
access companies; public relations firms; advertis ing agencies; public speakers; and radio and TV 
stations. Non-traditional media liability is used to describe what is known as “electronic” or “cyberspace” 
liability. These exposures result from communicating or conducting business online, via e-mail or the 
Internet.  Specifically, activities from these online me dia could result in claims alleging breaches of 
privacy rights, infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, employment discrimination, 
violations of obscenity laws, the spreading of com puter viruses, and defamation. Although most firms 
do not consider themselves to be in the technolog y business, any company that uses e-mail, sells its 
product online, or has access to the Internet, has electronic liability exposures—thus this exposure applies to nearly all business entities conducting operations in the United States today.   
Public Entity Liability Coverage 
Public entities are those entities not owned by private individuals or corporations. They are often, but 
not always, governmental bodies and frequently pr ovide actual services to the public. This category 
of non-medical professional liability insurance in cludes coverage for public officials, police 
departments, and educational institutions. 
Public Officials Liability (POL) Insurance 
This form of insurance provides liability coverage fo r the errors and omissions of public officials. It 
serves the same function for elected/appointed officials of federal, state, and local government as D&O insurance serves for the directors and officers of both for-profit and nonprofit corporations. However, there are two major differences between D&O and POL coverage. Fi rst, under POL forms, 
employees as well as elected/appointed public official s are insureds. In contrast, under D&O forms, 
only directors and officers are insureds. Second POL forms also cover the public entity, whereas with 
D&O policies, coverage for the corporate entity must be purchased separately. Second, specific coverage for employment practices lia bility is built into POL policy form s, whereas this is not true of 
D&O policy forms. 
Police Professional Liability (PPL) Insurance 
This type of insurance covers police officers and police departments, in conjunction with acts, errors, and omissions while performing thei r professional duties. The policies c over such perils as false arrest 
and civil rights violations. Unlike most professiona l liability insurance which are typically written on 
a claims-made basis, the PPL policies are sometim es written with occurrence triggers. Two important 
exclusions in PPL policies pertain to bodily in jury/property damage from premises and operations Chapter 3—Types of Professional a nd Management Liability Coverage 
25 exposures and claims involving automobile operatio ns. These exclusions apply since both types of 
exposures are covered separately under CGL and auto liability policy forms, respectively.  
Educators Legal Liability (ELL) Insurance 
This coverage applies to a broad range of non-b odily injury/non-property damage liability claims 
made against the administrators, employees, and staff members of both schools and colleges. ELL 
usually combines D&O, errors and omissions, EPL,  and sometimes media liability coverages in a 
single policy form.  Typical claims covered by ELL insurance include: negligent financial management, wrongful termination of a faculty memb er, wrongful dismissal of a student, failure to 
grant tenure to a faculty member, and negligent academic counseling. 
Miscellaneous E&O Liability Coverage 
Within this category of non-medical professional lia bility insurance is covera ge written for the many 
types of professionals for whom profession-speci fic policy forms do not exist. Miscellaneous 
professional liability (MPL) policies are therefore “g eneric” professional liability policies written to 
cover a broad range of professionals including, but not limited to interp reters, sports agents, interior 
decorators, process servers, detec tive agencies, auctioneers, custom s house brokers, title abstractors, 
and franchisors, just to name a few. Consultants are one of the most common types of businesses 
covered by MPL policies.  
Customizing Endorsements 
There is no standard miscellaneous professional liab ility policy form. Rather, each insurer writes its 
own policy to which customizing endorsements are added, based upon the particular profession being 
covered. For example, the typical MPL policy form contains an exclusion for copyright, trademark 
infringement, and plagiarism. However, when an M PL form is written to cover a literary agent, an 
endorsement will be added that removes this exclus ion. Similarly, the standard professional liability 
exclusion for bodily injury and property damage w ill be removed within an MPL policy written to 
cover a detective agency.  
Hazard Class Ratings 
One distinctive feature of MPL policy forms is that they are rated on what is known as a hazard class basis. Given the fact that there are more than 100  different professions covered under such forms (a 
number that is increasing continuous ly), underwriters do not have suffi cient claim data with which to 
develop accurate rates for each individual profession. Thus, most insurers group the many different professions they cover into hazard classes, from 1 to 5; with those in 1 and 5, being the least/most 
prone to claim frequency/severity, respectively, an d then charging each of the professions a specific 
rate per $1,000 of annual revenues, based on th e specific hazard class for which it applies.

Common Features of Professional and Management Liability Policy Forms 
Although PL and ML insurance policies differ signi ficantly, depending upon the type of individual 
coverage being addressed, there are also many similarities between these various forms. This chapter 
will describe the key common featur es of these policies. These include: 
• Insuring agreements 
• Limits, deductibles/retentions, coinsurance 
• Conditions 
• Exclusions 
• Coverage Triggers 
It concludes with a brief discussion about coordinating PL and ML policies with other types of insurance coverage.  
(Note: Subsequent courses in this series will examin e in more detail the distinctive features of the 
different types of PL and ML forms.)  
Insuring Agreements 
The insuring agreements common to PL insura nce policies include covered persons, covered 
acts/covered services, covered organizations, covered territory, covered damages, defense procedures, 
and defense cost provisions. 
Covered Persons 
PL and ML forms typically cover professionals wh ile they are acting within the scope of their 
professional duties.  The definition of “covered persons” extends to: employees, directors, officers, 
managers, supervisors, stockholders, owners , principals, volunteers, and interns.  
Independent contractors are generally not found w ithin the definition of “covered persons,” but in 
some instances they can be covered by endorse ment for an additional premium.  PL and ML 
insurance policies may also cover former empl oyees, spouses, and personal representatives, as 
indicated below.   Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
30 Coverage of Former Employees 
Most, although not all, PL and ML   policies cover “former” employees. This is advantageous because 
such coverage assures the cooperation of former em ployees in the event a claim is made against both 
the former employee and the insured organization.    
Coverage of Spouses 
When sued, professionals sometimes transfer their assets into the names of  their spouses as a means 
of protecting those assets. In recent years, plai ntiffs’ attorneys have responded by also naming 
spouses in lawsuits against the professionals. As a re sult, most PL and ML forms also afford coverage 
for the spouses of insureds.   
Coverage of Personal Representatives 
Since PL and ML claims are personal to the individual against whom a claim is made, such claims 
survive the death or incapacity of covered persons. For this reason, the policies cover the insured’s 
heirs, executors, trustees (including trustees in bankruptcy), and personal representatives. 
Covered Organizations 
The covered professional firm, corporation, public entity, or individual (if a sole practitioner), is 
designated as the “named insured” or “insured organization” under most PL and ML policies. In addition, the policies automatically cover subsidia ries of the covered organization, provided the 
covered organization is a majority owner of the s ubsidiary. However, the policies do not cover joint 
ventures or partnerships, unless these entities are specifically named on the policy as insureds. Usually, additional premium is required for such cove rage to apply, the amount of which is a function 
of the size and type of operations of such entities.  
Coverage of Predecessor Organizations 
It is important to recognize  that many PL policies also provide coverage for what are known as predecessor organizations. For example, assume that two accountants—“A” and “B”—form a 
partnership. After 5 years, they merge their practice with an existing partnership consisting of 
accountants “C,” “D,” and “E.” Assume this new combination purchases a PL policy. Under most insurers’ forms, coverage would be available for errors and omissions committed during the “A & B” partnership—even if claims arising from those acts are not made against the new firm until after the 
aforementioned merger of the two firms. PL policies use one of two approaches to provide 
predecessor firm coverage: (1) defining the term “named insured” so that  “predecessor firms” (i.e., 
the A& B partnership in the aforementioned example) , is included within that definition or (2) listing 
specific predecessor firms as “named insure ds” on the policy’s declarations page.  
Covered Services/Covered Acts 
Depending on the particular profession involved, PL policies indicate the specific scope of covered 
services/acts, in one of four places; in the policy’s: (1) definitions section, (2) insuring agreement, (3) 
declarations page, or (4) by means of an endorsement  to the policy (this can be either a standard or 
manuscript endorsement).  
It does not matter which of the four methods is used to indicate the scope of the insured’s services. 
However, it is important to verify that the description provided by any of these four methods matches the correct and complete scope of the insured’s activities  or is consistent with acts that are a generally accepted part of a given profession. For example, real estate brokers routinely handle Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
31 escrows of transactions in which they are also the br oker of record. In addition, they often broker or 
make mortgage loans, and they frequently offer notary services. As a result, these services need not 
be specifically enumerated by any of these four a pproaches for coverage to be afforded, other than 
having the policy cover “real estate brokerage services.”  On the other hand, if an insurance agent also 
performed actuarial work (services not usually offered by insurance agents), this must be specified 
within the policy’s declarations or be noted by endorsement.  
The Application: An Impor tant Indication of the Sc ope of Covered Services 
The application for PL coverage describes in detail the exact scope of the insured’s professional activities. To assure that all of the insured’s various activities will be covered by the policy, portions of the application that require a description of services provided should be reviewed carefully. On 
most applications, insureds are asked to list th e subcategories of services they provide. After each 
such category, either the total annual revenue gene rated from those services or the percentage of the 
insured’s annual revenue derived from such services must also be indicated. 
Covered Territory 
There are two types of territorial provisions used in PL and ML policies. The first type provides (1) unrestricted worldwide coverage, meaning that cove rage applies regardless of where the wrongful act 
took place and/or where a claim is brought against the insured. The second, and most common territorial provision affords coverage for (2) wr ongful acts taking place anywhere in the world, but 
only if the claim or suit is brought in the United States, its territories, possessions, or Canada.  
The Importance of Worldwide Coverage 
Insurers are usually willing to amend PL and ML policies to provide broader c overage, e.g., coverage 
for claims brought in additional, specific locations or coverage for claims brought anywhere in the 
world. Such extensions are especially important for professional organizations  having operations in 
non-U.S. locations as well as for businesses that have any kind of international electronic exposures (e.g., a hospital that subcontracts the reading of ra diological scans to firms in India; an insurance 
company that subcontracts data entry operations  to a company in Ireland). Absent a worldwide 
territorial provision, these exposures might not be co vered if claims are made against an insured, 
outside of the United States. 
Covered Damages/Covered Losses 
PL and ML insurance policies cover damages/losses fo r which the insured is legally liable and when 
such damages result from the delivery of professional services or during the course of business operations. Covered damages/losses are comprised of: (1) the costs to investigate and defend a claim 
against insureds and (2) amounts that result from e ither a judgment in a court of law against the 
insured(s) or a settlement between the insurer a nd the claimant. (Both settlements and judgments are 
termed “indemnity payments.”) 
Return of Professional Fees Are Not “Covered Damages” 
PL policies do not cover claims involving the return of fees or recoupment of charges that have been 
paid to a professional. For example, assume an ar chitect designs a defective building that collapses 
and injures several pedestrians. Also assume that the owner of the building who hired the architect 
sues the architect, demanding a return of the f ee paid. An architects and engineers professional 
liability policy would not provide coverage to the insured architect for return ing the fee, despite the Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
32 fact that the architect may still be legally liable to the claimant for doing so. Such coverage is 
precluded since the loss of professional fees is consider ed a “business risk,” rather than a professional 
liability exposure.  
Other Items That Are Not “Covered Damages” 
In addition, the following items generally do not fa ll within the typical PL and ML policy’s definition 
of “covered damages” or “loss”: (1) sanctions, (2) fi nes, (3) penalties, and (4) taxes. Such items are 
excluded because they are often triggered by willful misconduct that exceeds ordinary negligence and 
to cover these losses is considered to be against public policy. 
Coverage of Punitive Damages 
Punitive damages are frequently awarded agains t professionals and executives. Such damages are 
intended to punish a defendant (rath er than compensate a plaintiff/cl aimant for a specific loss) and are 
awarded to “send a message” that the defendant ’s conduct in causing the claim was unusually 
objectionable, with the intention of deterring such actions by this particular professional (and others) 
in the future. Although most PL and ML policy fo rms provide affirmative coverage for punitive 
damages, a significant minority exclude them.  The extent to which such coverage is found within a given policy is largely driven by the laws of i ndividual states, many of which do not allow punitive 
damages to be covered by an insurance policy.  
Covered Defense Costs 
As noted previously, all PL and ML policies cover th e costs required to investigate, defend, and settle 
claims. These items encompass: atto rneys’ fees, the cost of expert witnesses, court costs, bonds, and 
related expenses involved in the loss settlement process. 
Defense Costs are within, Not in Addition to Policy Limits 
Under the vast majority of PL and ML policies, de fense costs are covered within, rather than in 
addition to, policy limits. Accordingly, when monies are expended to defend an insured, this has the 
effect of reducing available policy limits. This appr oach contrasts with that used in CGL policies, 
whereby defense costs are covered in addition to policy limits. When coverage is written on this 
basis, the expenditure of defense costs does not re duce the policy’s limit of coverage, so that under a 
CGL form, an unlimited sum could be spent to defe nd an insured, without reducing the amount of 
money available to pay indemnity costs (i.e., settleme nts or judgments). Exhibit 4.1 illustrates this 
important concept.  
  Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
33 Exhibit 4.1 
Defense Cost Coverage Case Study 
Defense “within” Limits (Typical PL and ML policies) 
Policy Limit: $1 million 
Once defense costs and indemnity payments (i n any combination) have reached $1 million, no 
additional monies are available under the policy fo r either indemnity payments or defense costs. 
In fact, defense costs alone could exhaust the policy limit. 
Defense “in addition to” Limits (CGL policies) 
Policy Limit: $1 million 
Regardless of how much money has been expended to defend a claim against an insured, the full 
$1 million policy limit remains available to cover:  (1) $1 million of indemnity payments and (2) an 
unlimited amount of additional defense costs. T he policy’s $1 million limit can only be exhausted 
by indemnity payments. 
Application of Deductibles/Re tentions to Defense Costs 
Most PL and ML deductible/retention clauses state that  the deductible/retention is applied to both loss 
payments and claims expenses, regardless of whet her a loss payment is made. To illustrate, assume an 
insurer expended $30,000 to defend an insured but since the claim was dismissed before going to 
trial, the insurer was never required to pay a judgm ent on the insured’s behalf. If the policy contained 
a $10,000 deductible, the insurer would seek reimburseme nt from the insured in this amount to satisfy 
the policy’s deductible provision. Note that in this example and in actual practice, a deductible does 
not apply twice for a single claim. (i.e., $10,000 for the loss payment and $10,000 for the claims 
expense).  
However, a minority of PL policies do not apply re tentions/deductibles to defense costs, which is 
favorable for the insured. Under these policies, deductibles/retentions apply only to indemnity 
payments. Such policies are said to be written on a “first-dollar defense” basis.   
Covered Supplementary Payments 
Most PL and ML policies also cover what are termed “supplementary payments” that include first aid 
expenses, premiums on appeal bonds  and bail bonds, interest on ju dgments, and reasonable expenses 
incurred by the insured at the in surer’s request. The latter item typically involves travel expenses 
incurred during attendance at hearings and trials . Such expenses do not, however, under most forms, 
include the insured’s salary or earnings lost as a result of trial attendance or claim defense assistance. 
Defense Provisions  
The defense provisions within PL and ML polici es consist of: (1) defense procedures and (2) 
settlement procedures.  
Defense Procedures: “Duty To Defend” versus “Non-Duty To Defend” Language 
PL and ML policies are written with one of two typ es of defense procedure provisions: (1) “duty to 
defend” or (2) “non-duty to defe nd” provisions. The phrase “duty to defend” in a PL or ML policy 
expressly states that the insurer has the duty to defend any claim alleging a covered act under the 
policy. In contrast, the phrase “non-duty to defend” in dicates that the insurer does not have the duty to 
defend claims; rather, it is the duty of the insured to do so. Non-duty to defend forms only compel the 
insurer to pay the defense costs in connection with the insured’s executing th e defense of the claims. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
34 Smaller insureds generally select policies with duty to defend provisions because insurers have much 
more experience in, and are thus better equipped to manage, the complexities of PL and ML litigation. On the other hand, large corporate insureds (particularly those covered under D&O 
policies), often select non-duty to defend provisi ons because such organizations have the in-house 
expertise to manage major claims and therefore prefer  to have control over such matters, rather than 
delegating defense to an insurer.  
Settlement Procedures 
Disputes between insureds and insurers as to th e reasonableness of settlement amounts are often a 
difficult issue in PL and ML insurance. Compli cating the settlement process is the fact that 
professionals typically perceive an out-of-court settlement as an admission of guilt or  wrongdoing. 
Thus, they often oppose compromise settlements that might otherwise conserve legal costs, save time, and avoid adverse publicity. From the professional’ s point of view, an outsider learning of the 
settlement may infer (incorrectly) that a compro mise or a nuisance settlement was an admission of 
wrongdoing. However, from the insurer’s perspective, the settlement might save legal costs and, most important, avoid the risk of a “runaway jury ve rdict,” factors that could markedly increase the 
insurer’s total payout on the claim, in addition to  creating adverse publicity for the professional. 
The Hammer Clause Settlement Procedure 
The vast majority of PL and ML policies are written with a settlement procedure known as the “hammer clause,” which applies as follows. 
• Settlement Amounts.  The insurer is required to seek the insured’s consent prior to settling a 
claim for an amount proposed by the insurer and agreed to by the claimant. However, if an 
insured does not approve a settlement figure that has been offered by the insurer and agreed 
to by the claimant, and the claim is later clo sed for a larger amount, the insurer is liable only 
for the settlement amount initially agreed upon with the claimant.  
• Defense Costs.  If an insured withholds consent to a settlement recommended by the insurer, 
any additional defense costs and expenses accrue d from that point on are not covered by the 
policy.  
• Illustration. An insurer makes an agreement with a physician’s patient to settle a claim against the physician for $500,000. The physici an refuses to agree. The claim is settled 2 
years later for $750,000 and an additional $150,000 was incurred in defense costs during this 2-year period. Based on the hammer clause, th e insurer is not liable for the additional 
$250,000 in settlement costs (i.e., $750K fina l settlement – $500K initial recommendation = 
$250K). Nor is the insurer liable for the add itional $150,000 in defense costs that were 
incurred, following the physician’s refusal to settle the claim based on the insurer’s initial recommendation.  
Limits, Deductibles/Retentions, and Coinsurance Provisions 
There are both similarities and differences between th e ways in which limits, deductibles/retentions, 
and coinsurance are applied under PL and ML policies. 
  Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
35 Limits 
PL and ML policies use one of three methods in providing policy limits.  
• Single, annual aggregate limit. A policy contains only a single, annual aggregate limit (also 
called a “combined single limit”). Such limits indicate the maximum amount that can be paid 
out on the insured’s behalf during a given policy year. The aggregate can be applied to both 
indemnity payments and defense costs—in any proportion and irrespective of the number of different claims or claimant s. An example of this is a policy with a $1 million annual 
aggregate limit. 
• Equal per claim and annual aggregate limits. A policy contains both a per claim and an 
annual aggregate limit that are equal to each ot her. In actual practice, however, such policies 
operate in a manner identical to those using the language described above. An example of this 
is a policy with a $1 million annual aggregate limit and a $1 million per claim limit. 
• Unequal per claim and annual aggregate limits. A policy contains both a per claim limit 
and an annual aggregate limit where the limits ar e not identical (with the aggregate typically 
being two to three times the “per claim” limit). An example of this is a policy with a $1 
million per claim limit and a $3 million annual aggregate limit. 
“Related Claims” Provisions 
Related claims provisions, also sometimes called “interrelated” claims or “interrelated acts” 
provisions, are found in nearly all types of PL and ML policy forms. Related claims provisions apply 
to situations in which more than one claim resu lts from a single wrongful act or from what the policy 
defines as a series of “related wrongful acts.” Specifically, related claims provisions state the 
following. 
1. Limits.  If more than one claim results from a single wrongful act or a series of related 
wrongful acts, the insured receives the protection provided by the limit of coverage 
applicable when the first claim was made, rath er than the sum of the limits that were 
applicable to the policy periods during which a ll the claims were made (if claims are made 
against the insured during more than one policy period).  
2. Deductibles/Retentions.  If more than one claim results from a single wrongful act or a series 
of related wrongful acts, only one deductible/retention applies to all of the claims.  
Here is an illustration of how the related claims provision applies. The XYZ Corporation receives sexual harassment claims by three different female employees, all working in the same department, based on the conduct of one of its male supervisors.  The lawsuits are filed in three separate years: 
2008, 2009, and 2010. According to the terms of th e related claims provision, the policy limit that 
was in force during 2008 would be applicable to all th ree claims, rather than the sum of the limits that 
applied during 2008, 2009, and 2010.  In addition, only one de ductible would apply to all three 
claims.  
Exhaustion of Limits 
Most PL and ML policies state that once their limits  have been exhausted by any combination of 
indemnity payments and/or defense expenditures, the insurer’s duty to defend any and all claims 
against the insured ceases. However, exhaustion of  limits clauses apply only to situations where 
payments—rather than reserves—have exceeded limits . Assume that an insured against whom three 
claims were pending had a $1 million policy limit.  Also assume the insurer had reserved $500,000 Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
36 (for settlement and defense costs) for each of the three claims (a total of $1.5 million). In this 
situation, the insurer’s obligation to continue  defending the insured would not cease until $1 million 
had been paid on the insured’s behalf (in any comb ination of settlement or defense costs, across any 
combination of the three claims), despite the fact that total claim reserves exceeded the insured’s $1 
million policy limit.  
Deductibles/Retentions 
Nearly all PL and ML policies contain either de ductible or self-insured retention provisions.  
Deductibles versus Retentions 
Under a policy written with a deductible provision, the insurer pays the defense and indemnity costs associated with a claim—including the deductib le amount—and then seeks reimbursement of the 
deductible payment from the insured.  
Under a policy written with a retention provision, th e insured pays defense and/or indemnity costs 
associated with a claim until the retention amount is reached. After that point, the insurer makes any 
additional payments for defense and indemnity that are covered by the policy.   
Retentions are generally written for larger insure ds, such as corporations with D&O coverage or 
hospitals with HPL coverage. In  contrast, deductibles are normally found in PL policies written for 
smaller professional insureds, such as solo practiti oners in law, medicine , or accounting and under 
MPL policies. 
Coinsurance Provisions 
Coinsurance provisions are sometim es found in several lines of PL and ML coverage, most notably in 
EPL and D&O liability forms. They are, however, un common. This is especially true during soft 
insurance market conditions when competition between insurers is strong and few buyers (except 
those considered within the “difficult to in sure” category) are willin g to accept coinsurance 
provisions.  
Coinsurance provisions state that the insured must contribute a certain percentage of the costs 
associated with the defense and settlement of ever y claim. Normally, the coinsurance percentage 
ranges from 5 percent to 30 percent per claim. Coin surance provisions operate in a fashion identical 
to that used in healthcare indemnity policies, whereb y an insured, for example, might be required to 
pay, on an out of pocket basis, 20 percent of the first $10,000 of all costs on a given claim. 
Conditions 
The conditions section of a PL or ML policy can have a material effect on the actual scope of coverage the policy provides. The major policy conditions that will be discussed in this section include: (1) notice of cancellation and nonrenewal, (2) subrogation, (3) other insurance, and (4) 
various miscellaneous conditions. 
Notice of Cancellation and Nonrenewal 
There is considerable variation between the manner in which the various insurers handle the issue of 
policy cancellation and nonrenewal. Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
37 Notice of Cancellation 
The majority of policies require that the insured be  given 30 days’ notice prior to the date on which an 
insurer will cancel a policy. A significant minority of insurers’ forms provide 60 days’ notice prior to 
cancellation. Still others write policies which cannot  be canceled (except for nonpayment of premium 
or for material misstatements in the application) , which is favorable for the insured. In many 
instances, the length of the required notice of cancella tion period is a function of individual state law. 
Notice of Nonrenewal 
Some PL and ML forms include a provision requiring th at the insurer give advance notice if it intends 
not to renew the policy. When offered, this period is typically 30, 45, or 60 days and is often the same 
notice period the insurer is required to give for can cellation. As is the case with notice of cancellation 
provisions, the notice of nonrenewal provision period is sometimes mandated by state law and in such 
cases would be specified in that state’s amendatory endorsement.  
Subrogation Provisions 
Subrogation is the assignment to an insurer, by terms of the policy, after payment of a loss, of the 
rights of the insured to recover the amount of the loss from one legally liable for it. For example, assume an insured hospital is sued by a patient who is injured when a doctor negligently performs 
surgery on the patient at the insured’s hospita l. The hospital’s professional liability insurer 
indemnifies the hospital by making a payment to the injured patient on the hospital’s behalf. Under the terms of virtually all PL forms, the hospital’s insurer would then have the right to collect the 
amount of its payment from the doctor who negligently performed the surgery.  
Subrogation Waivers Prior to a Loss 
Standard subrogation provisions sometimes allow insu reds to waive subrogation prior to a loss. For 
instance, a project owner, as a condition of doing business with all design firms, may require that 
engineers waive their rights to subrogate against th e owner in the event the owner is responsible for 
causing a professional liability claim to be made against the engineers. Under these conditions, most professional liability insurers would be agreeable to allowing this waiver, especially if the insurer is notified prior to inception of the policy. 
Subrogation Waivers are Not Permitted After a Loss 
On the other hand, virtually no insurers’ forms allow insureds to waive subrogation after a loss. To do 
so would clearly violate the principle of indemnity. 
Other Insurance Clauses 
“Other” insurance provisions address situations in which the terms of one or more other policies also provide coverage for a PL or ML claim that is insured by a given policy. 
There are two purposes of other insurance clauses in  PL and ML policies. First, they are aimed at 
preserving the principle of indemnity. Specifically, thei r intent is to prevent possible moral hazard by 
making certain that an insured is not also compensated for the same claim by more than one insurance 
policy. In effect, other insurance clauses prevent a professional from making a profit as a result of a 
claim being made against him or her because he or she maintained multiple policies. The second 
rationale for other insurance provisions is to allo cate the payment of claims between insurers. As a 
result, other insurance clauses prev ent an insurer from profiting by not contributing to the payment of 
a claim that it rightfully insured, when a clai m is also covered by another insurer’s policy. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
38 Excess Other Insurance Clauses 
Nearly all PL and ML policies are written to apply as excess insurance in the event that another 
policy exists. However, in actual practice, and as a ma tter of law in many jurisdictions, if two policies 
cover the same claim and both contain this provi sion, both are primary and must therefore pay the 
claim on a pro rata basis, that is, in proportion to their respective limits.  
Miscellaneous Conditions 
There are several other “miscellaneous” PL and ML policy conditions that can have a meaningful 
effect on the manner in which the policies function.  
Prohibition of Voluntar y Payments and Settlements 
Nearly all PL policies contain language barring th e insured from making any voluntary payments to 
settle claims made against them without first obtaini ng the insurer’s consent. Such provisions prohibit 
the insured from: (1) admitting liability, (2) assuming future obligations to compensate a claimant, (3) 
making payments to a claimant, or (4) incurri ng any other expenses (e.g., defense costs) in 
conjunction with a claim. The purpose of such languag e is to assist the insurer in defending against a 
claimant’s legal action by preventing the insured from waiving his or her rights associated with the 
claim. By taking any of the actions noted above, an insured could be foregoing both his or her, as well 
as an insurer’s, right to later deny liability in c onjunction with a claim that is made against it.  
Cooperation Clause 
Nearly all PL and ML policies contain clauses that compel insureds to provide “reasonable efforts” to assist the insurer in defending claims made agai nst them. Such provisions are necessary because 
insureds sometimes believe that b ecause the insurer’s money—rather than their own—is at stake, the 
insurer should be the party to expend all of the time and effort necessary to defend claims under the 
policy. However, since the insured is the party di rectly cognizant of the facts surrounding claims, it is 
virtually impossible to conduct a strong defense in  the absence of cooperation from the insured.  
Legal Action against the Insurer 
The vast majority of PL and ML policies include pr ovisions stating that the insured cannot initiate a 
claim against an insurer in conjunction with a coverage dispute unless the insured has first complied with all terms of the policy and until an insured’s ultimate liability for a claim has been established. In 
other words, an insured cannot sue an insurer until there has been a settlement or a judgment rendered 
in connection with a professional liability claim ma de against the insured. Such a provision is 
sometimes referred to as a “no action” clause. The pur pose of this language is to prevent lawsuits in 
the event that an insured has not lived up to th e terms agreed on in the insurance contract (e.g., 
breaching the cooperation clause in the policy). These provisions also can prevent questionable litigation against an insurer until an insured’s actual dollar liability for a disputed claim made against 
him or her has been determined.  
Mandatory Arbitration Provision 
A significant number of PL and ML policies contain provisions that require disputes between the insured and the insurer be submitted to binding arbitr ation rather than allowing either party to resort 
to the conventional court system. The effect of this provision is to expedite the resolution of 
coverage-related controversies, gi ven the long delays inherent in the U.S. judicial process. Also 
important is the fact that arbitration typically re duces the cost of settling such disputes compared to Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
39 utilizing the traditional court system. Although the ma ndatory arbitration prov ision benefits both the 
insurer and the insured for these reasons, arbitration probably affords greater be nefit to the insurer. 
This is because it is generally believed that arbitr ators are less biased against insurance companies 
than are judges and juries, as evidenced by the ra re incidence of astronomical arbitration awards 
against insurers, compared to the sometimes huge verdicts rendered by juries.  
Nontransferability Provisions 
Most PL and ML policies contain wording to the effect that coverage cannot be automatically 
transferred to another individual or entity without th e insurer’s consent. Provisions of this kind, also 
known as nonassignability clauses, are necessary because PL insurance is  based on the underwriter’s 
desire to cover only the named insured. For instan ce, assume that during the term of coverage an 
accountant (who is a sole practitioner) sells hi s practice to another accountant. Under these 
circumstances, the nontransferability provision will reserve for the insurer the right not to extend 
coverage to the new owner of the practice. Be cause PL policies are personal contracts, the 
underwriter must be given the opportunity to evaluate , offer different coverage  terms and/or premium, 
and perhaps reject another indivi dual or entity seeking named insured status under the original named 
insured’s policy.  
Severability Provisions 
Severability provisions are included in the majority  of PL and ML forms. Such provisions indicate 
that the coverage applies separately to each insured under the policy. There are two significant 
implications of severability clauses: (1) they provide coverage for so-called “innocent” insureds, in 
situations where the conduct of one insured woul d otherwise void the policy (e.g., partner “A” in a 
law firm absconds with a client’s trust fund; partner “B” the other, “innocent” partner would still have 
coverage for a claim made against him if the client  sues both partners A and B) and (2) they reinforce 
the fact that while coverage can apply separately to  different insureds, this does not increase the limits 
of the policy (i.e., an accountants professional lia bility policy is written with a $1 million limit; a 
claim is made against each for the firm’s three partne rs; a total of $1 million of coverage applies to all 
three partners—not $1 million for each partner).  
Continuation of Coverage in Bankruptcy 
Most PL and ML policies indicate that coverage c ontinues when an insured has declared bankruptcy. 
The lack of coverage for an otherwise valid cl aim—despite an insured’s bankruptcy declaration—
would obviously add to the hardships being experienced by an insured under such circumstances. Among other things, a coverage de nial would make it more difficult for an insured to repay 
outstanding creditors, thereby impeding the insure d’s eventual return to professional practice. 
Nevertheless, even in the absence of such a provisi on, as a practical matter, it would be difficult for 
an insurer to walk away from its obligation to defend and indemnify in an otherwise covered claim situation.  
Exclusions 
Policy exclusions—both those included in the form  itself and those added by endorsement—have a 
profound effect on the scope of coverage provided by PL and ML policies. In fact, the forms vary 
more in their exclusionary language than in any other coverage aspect. Consequently, it is necessary 
to carefully examine the exclusions contained in all PL and ML policies.  Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
40 The Duty To Defend Is Broade r than the Duty To Indemnify 
Even when an ML or PL policy contains an exclus ion that is worded to exclude both indemnity and 
defense coverage (known as a “blanket exclusionary provision”), insurers will usually provide 
defense coverage for the insured, in spite of such exclusionary policy language. As an industry 
practice and according to caselaw, an insurer’s duty to defend is considered to be broader than its 
duty to indemnify. So unless a claim (or a specific allegation within a claim) is clearly excluded, 
insurers will often defend the insured, even when an exclusion might preclude coverage for indemnity 
payments associated with the claim.   
There are four general kinds of exclusions: (1) ex clusions for uninsurable exposures; (2) exclusions 
removable or modifiable by negotiation, with or without additional premium; (3) exclusions for 
exposures better suited to coverage under other types of policies; and (4) exclusions for exposures 
pertaining to a specialized type of work within a given profession.  
Uninsurable Exposure Exclusions 
Certain types of activities are not considered to be insurable, regardless of an insured’s willingness to 
pay a premium for coverage. Such exposures are excluded for one of three reasons. 
• Exposures within an insured’s control.  Claims arising from these exposures are, at least to 
some extent, within the control of the insu red (e.g., claims against notaries who notarize 
signatures despite not having signatories personally appear).  
• Insurance is against public policy.  Insurance coverage for the exposure is prohibited by law 
or is against public policy (e.g., coverage for intentional injury or criminal acts).  
• Economic or business risk. The exposure represents a business or economic risk that is not a 
proper subject of professional liability coverage  (e.g., claims for the return of professional 
fees as described earlier).  
Notary Claims 
A number of insurers exclude coverage for claims in which, while the insured is acting as a notary, 
the signatory to a document did not sign the document in the presence of the notary-insured. 
Exclusions of claims involving notarized documents are most prevalent in policies written for 
lawyers, accountants, real estate brokers, and insura nce agents, whose work often requires them to 
notarize documents. The rationale for excluding claims in which the signatory did not sign the document in question in the notary’s presence is that  preventing the kinds of suits noted above is 
within the control of the insured.  
Trademark and Copyri ght Infringement 
Trademark and copyright infringement exclusions are most commonly found in coverage written for architects and engineers, because design professionals sometimes may use or appropriate the plans or 
drawings of another architect within the course of  their professional activities. With lesser frequency, 
trademark and copyright exclusions are also found in lawyers’, accountants’, and insurance agents’ 
PL policies. The rationale for such exclusions is th at trademark and copyright infringement is within 
an insured professional’s control an d can generally be prevented with  relatively little diligence. On 
the other hand, media liability policies, such as tho se for publishers, advertisers, or broadcasters, do 
not contain this exclusion; rather, they affirmatively cover such perils. This is because such perils involve “core” PL exposures for media businesses, given the frequency of claims alleging trademark and copyright infringement, many of which are ground less. (For this reason, the defense coverage Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
41 provided by media policies is essential to such firms. ) In contrast,  for other types of professionals, 
such as architects and engineers,  copyright and trademark infringement represent minimal exposures, 
which, for the most part, can usually be prevente d by using a minimum amount of care (e.g., seeking 
permission prior to using or refe rencing the work of others). 
Previously Reported Claims and “Known” Incidents 
Virtually all policies restrict coverage of claims  pertaining to one or more of the following three 
exposures. 
• Claims reported to prior insurers.  
• Claims reported under prior policies with the same insurer.  
• Claims arising from incidents that were, prior to the inception of the policy period, known by 
the insured to have the potential for resulting in claims (i.e., non-fortuitous claims).  
The intent of this exclusion (which is some times broken up into two or even three separate 
exclusions) is to eliminate coverage for claims that  (1) are the responsibility of another insurer, (2) are 
within the scope of another policy period under a policy written by the current insurer, or (3) should 
not be covered because the insured was aware of th e likelihood that a claim would be made, and the 
claim is therefore lacking in fortuity (i.e., in such situations, the insurer should not be asked to cover 
the so-called “burning building”).  
Antitrust Violations 
Providing coverage for acts involving antitrust violations is against public policy in some jurisdictions and therefore not within the intended scope of coverage under most PL and ML policies. 
(Antitrust laws prohibit certain mergers of businesses in situations where such combinations would 
create possible monopolies and as a result, inhibit competition within a particular industry.) Moreover, coverage is also commonly excluded for such acts since they are generally within the 
control of the insured.  
Nevertheless, a number of policies do not preclude c overage on an absolute basis, meaning they do 
provide coverage to defend allega tions that the insured violated antitrust laws. Specifically, policies 
designed to cover managed care orga nizations cover defense of antitrus t allegations and some actually 
provide coverage for damages associated with such  claims. This is because antitrust allegations are 
such a frequent source of liability for managed care organizations that coverage of  this peril is offered 
by the market.  
Return of Professional Fees 
This exclusion pertains to situations where the client of a professional pays monies to the professional 
for services and then, as a result of errors or omissi ons in the professional’s wo rk, the client demands 
a refund of such fees. If a court were to rule that  the professional was liable to return such monies, a 
policy containing a return of professional fees exclus ion would not provide cove rage for this portion 
of the claim. (As noted earlier, coverage for the return of professional is also precluded under a 
number of PL policies by means of the forms’ definition of “damages” or “loss.”) 
  Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
42 Illegal Personal Profit 
Claims that insureds have gained personal profit or advantage to which they were not legally entitled, 
is another exposure that is consid ered uninsurable. An example of  illegal personal profit may involve 
a director of a corporation who owns a firm that is bidding on a contract proposal offered by the 
organization on whose board he sits. If the director’s company wins the bid because he was privy to 
the bids submitted by other competitor firms or po ssessed other “inside” information that assisted his 
company in securing the contract, a claim of ille gal personal profit could be made. Many PL and 
virtually all D&O policies exclude  coverage for such claims. 
Nonpecuniary Relief 
Most of the policies exclude coverage for cl aims seeking nonpecuniary relief, which means 
nonmonetary damages. For example, assume that an insurance agent promises to obtain coverage for a client under a certain type of policy at a specific premium. If the agent were unable to locate an insurer willing to write such a policy, given the presence of an exclusion of claims for nonpecuniary 
relief, the agent’s insurer would not provide a policy of insurance for the client under these circumstances. (Although, if the claimant were to sue the agent, the policy would provide monetary 
damages that resulted from the agent’s failure to secu re the policy, for example, where a building that 
an agent “promised” to insure burned to the ground.) Exclusions precluding coverage for monetary relief are necessary, because in many instances, it wo uld be literally impossible to provide the actual 
relief sought by a claimant (i.e., no insurer may be able to write the specific type of policy requested by the client and promised by the insu rance agent, in the example above).  
Bankruptcy of Insured 
Most policies exclude coverage for claims aris ing from the insolvency or bankruptcy of a 
professional. For instance, if a professional experi ences financial difficulties and cannot complete a 
project or engagement, there would be no coverage  for providing him or her with funds to complete 
the project or to pay another professional to do so. Nor does the policy cove r any costs associated 
with the insured’s failure to meet his or her bus iness obligations, such as to pay monies owed to 
suppliers, vendors, or other creditors . The rationale behind this exclusion is that it prevents the insurer 
from becoming a surety. 
Intentional, Criminal, Fraudulent, Willful, or Dishonest Acts 
Virtually every PL and ML policy contains exclusi ons for coverage of criminal, fraudulent, or 
intentional acts. However, there are numerous situa tions in which a claim results from acts that were 
intentional on the insured’s part, but the result of the act was unintentional. For example, a surgeon may have intentionally performed a procedure in a certain way but injured a patient in the process. 
Accordingly, policies typically qualify intentional acts exclusions so that there is coverage, unless the 
act is performed maliciously, dishonestly, or with the intent to injure. 
Importantly, nearly all PL and ML policies affirmativ ely provide defense covera ge if allegations of 
criminal acts are made against the insured. If th e allegations are ultimately proven groundless, most 
policy forms state that the insured has the benefit of defense coverage. On the other hand, if the 
allegations are ultimately proven to be true, the insurer may be entitled to reimbursement of the 
defense costs that have been pa id on the insured’s behalf. Howe ver, according to caselaw, insurers 
have no right to such reimbursement unless this was agreed upon prior to policy inception.  Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
43 Another key point regarding this exclusion: many ve rsions are worded so that coverage for so-called 
“innocent insureds” is affirmatively provided when  allegations of intentional wrongdoing, such as 
fraud, are made against culpable members of a professional organization and yet other innocent 
persons are also named in a lawsuit. Such wording w ithin this exclusion has the effect of covering the 
defense costs of these “innocent insureds.” 
Losses from Professional Guarantees 
Many PL forms contain exclusions of coverage for loss arising from professional guarantees. (For 
example, a doctor might guarantee that following Lasik surgery, a patient will have 20/20 vision in 
both eyes.) More specifically, the policies preclude c overage for situations in  which (1) a professional 
promises that a certain result will follow from his or performance and (2) this specific result is not 
realized.  
Losses from Commingling and Accounting Practices 
Also within the category of uninsurable “busin ess risks” are claims resulting from accounting and 
commingling losses. For example, as a result of the accounting reconciliation process, a professional 
may discover a shortfall of funds, despite not being able to pinpoint the actual source of such losses. 
This often occurs in professional practices involving the commingling of monies from a number of clients (e.g., in insurance agenci es and stock brokerage offices).  
Removable/Modifiable Exclusions 
In a few instances, underwriters impose exclusions that can be removed from the policy—or at least 
modified—sometimes without the need to pay an additional premium. There are four common exclusions that fall into this category: (1) failure to maintain insurance, (2) contractual liability, (3) 
insured versus insured, and (4) prior and pending litigation.  
Failure To Maintain Insurance Exclusion 
Some directors and officers (D&O) forms contain ex clusions precluding coverage for claims resulting 
from the failure of insureds to purchase and mainta in insurance coverage. This exclusion might be 
applicable if, for example, a corporation failed to  purchase flood insurance and, as a result, suffered a 
severe uninsured loss at one of its manufacturing plants, resulting in a quarterly loss for the organization and a subsequent drop in the firm’s  share price. If stockholders were to sue the 
company’s directors and officers, alleging that th eir negligence in not buyi ng flood insurance caused 
the firm’s share price to drop, an insurer could in voke the failure to maintain insurance as a rationale 
for denying coverage. However, many insurers will remove this exclusion if the insured submits a 
schedule of insurance, indicating to the underwr iter that there are no major property and liability 
exposures that are uninsured. 
Contractual Liability Exclusion 
Contractual liability exclusions preclude coverage for situations where one professional agrees to 
hold another professional harmless in  conjunction with work performed  on a subcontracted basis. For 
instance, assume that accountant “A” subcontracts a portion of an engagement to accountant “B.” 
Also assume that “B” agrees to hold “A” harmless for any claims made against “A” in conjunction with the project. However, if B’s PL policy contains a contractual liability exclusion, B will have no coverage if it is contractually re quired to indemnify A for any prof essional liability claims associated 
with the project. It is common, however, for cont ractual liability exclusions to be worded so they Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
44 provide an exception (and thereby provi de coverage) for liability that would have attached even in the 
absence of a contract. For example, assume that a construction contract provision required an insured 
architect to indemnify and hold harmless the project  owner for the insured’s sole negligence (i.e., if 
the architect’s faulty design caused a loss, he woul d be required to indemnify the project owner for 
the loss). In this instance, coverage would still a pply under most versions of the contractual liability 
exclusion. This is because liability would ordinarily  apply (as in the above example of the accounting 
firms), regardless of a contractual provi sion requiring such indemnification.  
Insured versus Insured Exclusion 
Insured versus insured exclusions preclude covera ge for claims made by one insured under a PL or 
ML policy against another. There are several rational es for the insured versus insured exclusion. First, 
the exclusion is aimed at precluding coverage for recouping losses from bad business decisions. Case-
in-point: during the mid-1980s, in response to losses suffered from imprudent extensions of credit, 
Bank of America began suing its loan officers, who then sought coverage under the bank’s D&O 
policy. After receiving a number of such claims, D&O insurers began to insert insured versus insured 
exclusions into their forms, explaining that  the policy was not intended to function as an 
indemnification vehicle for bad business decisions (viewing this as coverage for “business risk” or 
speculative risk, rather than prof essional negligence). Second, since many professional organizations 
purchase employment practices liability (EPL) coverage, insurers feel that covering claims by one insured against another is more  appropriately the function of EPL policy forms rather than a PL 
policy. Third, suits by one insured against anot her are sometimes the result of “infighting,” yet 
another situation that really does not involve professional liability. For example, one doctor in a group practice may sue another doctor in the partnership, claiming that he or she owed money to the doctor 
or the practice.  
Prior and Pending Litigation 
Nearly all D&O policy forms, many EPL policies,  and an increasing number of PL policies exclude 
claims arising from litigation that was pending prio r to the inception of the policy. For example, 
assume that a breach of contract lawsuit was brought  against a corporation—rather than individual 
directors and officers—prior to the inception of a D&O policy. After inception of the policy, the suit 
is amended to name the organization’s director s and officers. The claim against the company’s 
directors and officers would be precluded by the pr ior and pending litigation exclusion. The intent of 
the exclusion is to avoid insuring the so-called “ burning building,” whereby the insurer is being asked 
to cover claims from events that were lacking in fortuity and that sometimes provide the incentive for 
an insured to obtain coverage. 
Exclusions To Coordinate  with Other Insurance 
Most PL and ML policies exclude coverage for exposures that are more appropriately insured by 
other types of insurance, such as general liabilit y, automobile liability, and workers compensation 
policies. Also in this category are PL exposur es that are more properly insurable under other 
professional liability policies, such as Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 
responsibilities under fiduciary liability policy forms. 
Employment Practices 
Coverage for EPL claims, namely, allegations of  discrimination, sexual harassment, wrongful 
termination, retaliation, and other workplace torts (e.g., wrongful evaluation, constructive discharge, 
work-related defamation) is precluded by nearly all PL forms. There are two reasons for this. First, Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
45 EPL claims do not normally involve the delivery of professional services. Rather, they emanate from 
the employment process. Second, recent years have witnessed rapid growth of a significant market for EPL coverage. More than 50 insurers, as well as th e Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO), have 
developed specialized policy forms expressl y designed to cover this exposure.  
Bodily Injury/Property Damage 
Most PL and ML policies exclude coverage for bodi ly injury (BI) and property damage (PD) liability 
because coverage for incidents of this kind (e.g., sl ip and fall claims in a professional’s office) are 
more properly the subject of CGL insurance. (However, as already noted, BI/PD exclusions do not appear in the policies written for certain professionals  such as doctors and architects and engineers.)  
Personal Injury 
Claims involving personal injury caused by libel, sla nder, false arrest, invasion of privacy, malicious 
prosecution, and other standard personal injury perils are excluded by many PL policies. This is because CGL forms normally apply to such exposures . As with BI/PD exclusions, personal injury 
exclusions do not appear in PL policies written fo r certain professions such as lawyers, because the 
nature of their work frequently creates personal in jury exposures, coupled with the fact that PL 
exclusions within their CGL forms would otherwise eliminate coverage for these types of claims.  
Related/Affiliated Entities 
First, these exclusions eliminate coverage for clai ms made against related entities that are not named 
insureds. Such firms should either be named on the insured’s policy or they should maintain their 
own professional liability policy. For example, a physician’s professional liability policy would exclude coverage for claims made against the physi cal therapy clinic that sh e owns, because the clinic 
should either have a separate policy covering it or should be insured under the physician’s 
professional liability policy.  
Second, related/affiliated entity ex clusions also preclude coverage for situations where a claim is 
made by a related or controlled en tity against the insured. For exampl e, an insurance broker also owns 
an independent claims adjusting firm. The adjus ting firm brings a claim against the brokerage 
alleging that the broker furnished its adjuster with incorrect coverage about one of the brokerage’s 
clients. As a result, the adjuster wrote a check for a loss that was not covered, which, in turn, caused 
the insurer the adjuster was representing to sue th e adjusting firm for paying a $50,000 claim not 
covered by the policy issued by th e insurer. The rationale for the exclusion of claims by related 
entities (against the insured) is th at such claims are sometimes (although not always) of a collusive 
nature, whereby an insured attempts to profit by suing his or her own company.  
Claims from the Delivery of Re lated Professional Services 
A number of PL policies contain exclusions for pr ofessional services that are related but different 
from the kinds of services primarily performed by the insured. For example, real estate brokers’ E&O liability policy forms usually exclude  coverage for legal services. This is because a number of real 
estate operations, such as title closings, require th e services of an attorney. The intent of this 
exclusion is to protect the insurer from having to cover exposures that are different from—and often pose higher potential loss severity—than those intended to be covered by the policy.  Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
46 Workers Compensation 
Virtually all PL and ML policies exclude covera ge for any type of obligation under workers 
compensation, disability, unemployment, or simila r laws. Such exposures s hould be covered under 
workers compensation policies.  
ERISA Responsibilities 
Coverage for claims involving the administration a nd management of pension and benefit plans are 
excluded under virtually all PL and ML forms (except fiduciary liability policies). In some cases, this 
exclusion is worded so that it specifically  precludes coverage for insured professionals’ 
responsibilities as enumerated by th e Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 or 
by similar laws. The rationale for this exclusion is that such exposures are insurable under separate 
fiduciary liability policies.  
Public Service Positions/Ser vice for Another Entity 
Most PL and ML policies exclude coverage for cl aims arising from activities outside the employing 
entity. For instance, this would include liabilities in conjunction with serving on the boards of for-
profit/nonprofit organizations and for the insured’s wo rk on behalf of public agencies. The exclusion 
is primarily intended to preclude coverage of an in sured’s work on behalf of nonprofit groups because 
separate coverage should be purchased to cover th ese individuals (i.e., a D&O policy is normally 
required to cover such exposures). This exclus ion is also intended to preclude coverage for 
moonlighting activities, for example, when an accountant, employed by a CPA firm, moonlights as a 
tax preparer.  
Motor Vehicles, Airc raft, Watercraft 
Liability arising out of automobiles, watercraft, ai rcraft, or any other types of motor vehicles, is 
excluded by virtually all PL and ML forms. These exposures must be separately insured. 
Pollution 
Virtually all PL and ML policies exclude coverage for claims involving pollution. This is because few 
ML and PL risks (other than medical facilities and architects & engineers) actually generate direct 
exposures to pollution.   
Nuclear Energy 
Most PL and ML forms contain broad form nuclear en ergy exclusions. Their intent is similar to the 
rationale underlying pollution exclusions discussed in the above paragraph. .  
Exclusions for Specialized Exposures 
To compel disclosure of particularly hazardous activities in which insureds engage, insurers sometimes include in policies exclusions of exposur es they are otherwise willing to cover. A number 
of professions have specialized practices that ge nerate greater-than-average exposures to claims. 
Notable examples include the following. 
• Cosmetic surgery and bariatric surgery (physicians)  
• Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) work (attorneys)  
• Investment consulting (accountants)  Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
47 • Managing general agency operations (insurance agents)  
• Soil testing (engineers)  
Coverage for these and similar activities are some times excluded by standard policies written for 
these professions. However, these restrictions can freque ntly be removed or modified, in return for 
the payment of additional premium. By making exclus ions of this kind a part of the standard policy 
forms written for professionals not engaged in these more  hazardous specialties, the insurer, in effect, 
imposes a requirement that it be notified should th e hazardous activity ever be undertaken. It may 
then charge an additional premium to cover the increased exposure. 
Coverage Triggers 
A liability insurance policy’s coverage trigger is the provision defining the nature and sequence of 
events that must take place for the policy to cove r a claim against an insured. The coverage trigger 
determines which policy, often in a series of polici es spanning a number of years, will respond to a 
particular liability claim. 
The vast majority of PL and ML policies contain clai ms-made coverage triggers. This is in contrast to 
the more familiar occurrence coverage trigger, ty pically found in most CGL and umbrella liability 
forms. Occasionally, however, occurrence trigge rs are found in professional liability policies written 
for media liability, police liability, medical malpractice, and hospital professional liability policies.  
 Coverage applies under an occurrence policy when an act occurs during the policy period that causes 
an injury or damage. The policy is triggered, regard less of how far in the future a claim associated 
with that act results in a formal claim. (Note: Occurrence coverage triggers will be examined in a 
future course in this series.) 
How Claims-Made Coverage Triggers Function 
For coverage to apply under a claims-made policy, the following three conditions must be fulfilled: 
• The claim must be first made,  
• Against the insured during the policy period, and 
• The act giving rise to the claim must have taken place on or after the policy’s retroactive date. 
First-Made Language 
First, coverage applies under a claims-made policy on ly if a claim is first made against the insured 
during the policy period. This means that the clai m must not have been previously made during a 
prior policy period—regardless of whether or not such policy was written by the current insurer or by 
a different insurer. “First made” wording has tw o key implications: (1) it precludes coverage for 
claims that should rightfully be the responsibility of a previous insurer, and (2) it prevents the insured 
from obtaining coverage under a subsequent policy wr itten by the same insurer that may be more 
favorable to his or her interests (e.g., one written with a higher limit). Given these reasons, virtually 
all claims-made policies are written with “claims first made” language. 
Against the Insured, during the Policy Period 
Second, for coverage to apply, the claim must be made against the insured during the policy period. This means that during the policy period, the in sured must receive formal notice (most often by 
means of a summons and complaint) that a claim seeking damages is being made against him. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
48 Coverage will apply only if such notice is receive d during the actual term of the claims-made policy.  
Claims made against the insured either before the inception date of the policy or after the policy term 
has expired, will not be covered. 
On or after the Poli cy’s Retroactive Date 
Third, for coverage to apply, the act giving rise to the claim must have taken place on or after the 
policy’s retroactive date. A retroactive date is us ually noted on the policy’s declarations page, and 
indicates that coverage will apply only if the act giving rise to the claim took place on or after that 
date.  
For example, assume a policy is written with a term of  1/1/10–11 and a retroactive date of 1/1/08. For 
coverage to apply to a claim, the alleged wrongful professional act that gave rise to the claim must 
have taken place on or after 1/1/08. Assume a su rgeon operates on a patient on July 1, 2009. The 
surgeon receives notice of a lawsuit on March 1, 2010. Coverage applies because the alleged 
wrongful act (i.e., the surgery) was performed on July 1, 2009, which is after the policy’s 1/1/08 retroactive date and because the claim was made  against the insured during the 1/1/10–11 policy 
period. (Note that if the operation had been pe rformed prior to the policy’s January 1, 2008 
retroactive date, coverage would not have applied despite the fact that the claim was made during the 1/1/10–11 policy period.)   
The Purpose of Retroactive Dates 
There are two purposes of retroactive dates: (1) to e liminate coverage for situations or incidents that 
insureds recognize have the potential to produce a clai m in the future and (2) to preclude coverage for 
“stale” claims that arise from events  far in the past, even if such ev ents are unknown to the insured. In 
the former case, the retroactive da te preserves the principle of “fortuity,” that is, the insurer should 
not be called upon to cover the so- called “burning building.” In the latter instance, the retroactive date 
makes policies more affordable by precluding coverage  for events that are remote in time. Exhibit 4.2 
provides another example of how coverage is triggered under a claims-made policy.  
Exhibit 4.2 
How a Claims-Made Policy Functions 
 
 
 
In this example, coverage applies because: (1) the claim was first made, (2) during the 1/1/11–12 
policy period, and (3) the wrongful act took place after the policy’s 1/1/10 retroactive date. Had 
the surgery been performed prior to the policy’s 1/1/ 10 retroactive date, coverage would not have 
applied. Similarly, there would have been no coverage, had the claim been made against the insured prior to 1/1/11 or after 1/1/12. 
 
Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
49 The Rationale for Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
It is inherently difficult to project the amount of money that will ultimately be paid out under a given 
set of insurance policies written with occurrence tri ggers. This is because often, an act that took place 
during the term of an occurrence policy will not r esult in a claim until a number of years after the 
policy has expired (often referred to as long-tail clai m exposure). In addition, even after the claim is 
made, it may require an even longer period of tim e to litigate and ultimately settle. Thus, at the 
expiration of an occurrence policy term, an underwrite r will have only a vague idea as to the ultimate 
claim liabilities that will result fro m a given policy, and even more so under an entire book of 
business written on an occurrence basis. 
Unique Aspects of Professional Liability Exposures 
The inherent time lag between an occurrence and the making of a claim related to that occurrence, is 
especially prevalent with respect to PL and ML  exposures. Case-in-point: a number of years 
sometimes pass before a patient even realizes that he has been injured by a doctor (e.g., when a 
sponge is left in a patient’s stomach during an oper ation). Similarly, there is usually a significant time 
lapse between the date when an architect designs  a defective building and the date on which it 
collapses, injuring pedestrians or occupants. In a D&O context, the misconduct of Enron’s directors 
and officers did not produce financial ruin for the company until about 5 years after dishonest 
accounting practices had begun. In short, there ar e significant time lags between the commission of 
wrongful professional acts, the filing of claims, and conclusion of the litigation that ultimately settles 
such claims. As a result, if underwriters wrote PL and ML coverage on an occurrence basis it would 
be very difficult to estimate accurately their ultimate dollar liability on the day a book of recently-
expired business.   
Easier to Price Coverage 
In contrast, under a claims-made policy, coverage applies only to claims that are made against the 
insured during the term of the policy. Thus, shortl y before the date on which a policy expires, an 
underwriter will be in a position to make a fairly  accurate estimate of the ultimate claim liabilities 
associated with that policy, and by extension, th e liability associated with a book of ML/PL business. 
This, in turn, makes it easier for a PL/ML underwriter to price coverage for policies that are about to 
renew. For this reason, nearly all PL and ML polic ies are written on a claims-made rather than on an 
occurrence basis.  
Discovery Provisions 
Nearly all claims-made policies state that if the insu rer is notified of a circumstance or incident that 
takes place during the policy period, but before a clai m associated with that circumstance or incident 
is made, claims arising out of that circumstance will be considered to have been made during that 
policy period. This is despite the fact that the actual claim is made against the insured many years 
after the policy period has terminated.  
Illustration 
After being terminated without prior notice, an employee who worked 20 years for a company tells a co-worker (as he is being escorted out of the build ing by security): “They’ve got no right to do this. 
I’m going to sue them for this!” Given this situati on coupled with the employee’s statement, it is quite 
possible that a lawsuit will be fo rthcoming. Accordingly, the insured would be well-advised to notify 
its EPL insurer of a potential claim under the policy’ s discovery provision. If the insured does make a Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
50 claim, coverage will apply under that policy, regard less of how far in the future the ex-employee 
brings a lawsuit. This concept is illustrated in Exhibit 4.3. 
 
Exhibit 4.3 
How a Discovery Provision Functions 
 
 
 
In this example, coverage applies because t he insurer was notified by the insured of an 
employment-related “incident” on 8/1/10. Although th e claim associated with the incident was not 
made against the insured until after the 1/1/10–11 policy had expired, coverage applies 
nonetheless because the insurer was notified of the incident under the policy’s discovery provision. 
 
The Purpose of Discovery Provisions 
Discovery provisions protect insureds whose polic ies might be canceled or nonrenewed between the 
occurrence of some event that ma kes a claim likely (as in the above  example) and the time the claim 
is actually brought against the insured. Without such a provision, it would be difficult for an insured 
to change insurers. For instance, in the example in  Exhibit 4.3, if the insured sought to change 
insurers at the expiration of the 1/1/10–11 policy term, a replacement insurer would exclude coverage 
for the possible wrongful termination claim of which the insured was aware. However, by virtue of 
having notified its current insurer under the policy’s discovery provision, coverage is “locked in” by 
the current insurer for any claim that ultimately results from the incident—regardless of how far in 
the future a lawsuit is received. Since coverage is  now available under its expiring policy, the insured 
has the flexibility to change insurers , without having to be concerned about the fact that coverage for 
the potential claim/incident will be excluded by the new insurer. 
Extended Reporting Provisions 
Extended reporting periods (ERPs)—also known as extended discovery or “tail” provisions—allow 
insureds to report claims after a policy has expired or been canceled. For coverage to apply under an 
ERP, a wrongful act must take place during the expired/canceled policy and a claim associated with that act must be made and reported to the insurer during the ERP.  
ERPs are valuable for two reasons. First, they allow insureds to change insurers (without producing a 
coverage gap) even if the new insurer does not c over prior acts. (Policies covering “prior acts” cover 
claims from acts that took place on or after the date  on which continuous PL or ML coverage was first 
purchased.)  Second, if the insured did not contin ue buying PL/ML insurance, the ERP will cover  
claims made against the insured after the policy expired. An ERP literally “extends” the period of 
Chapter 4—Common Features of Professional and Management Liability 
Policy Forms 
51 time during which claims under an expired (or canceled) policy can be reported to and thus covered 
by an insurer.  
The illustration in Exhibit 4.4 demonstrates how an ERP functions. 
 
Exhibit 4.4 
How an Extended Reporting Period Functions 
 
• Insurer A’s Policy Term: 1/1/11–12  
• Insured buys an ERP from Insurer A, with a term of 1/1/12–13 
• Wrongful Act: 7/1/11 
• Claim Made and Reported: 7/1/12   
 
 
 
Coverage applies under the ERP because the wrongful act took place during Insurer A’s 1/1/11–12 
policy term and a claim associated with the act w as made and reported during the term of Insurer A’s 
1/1/12–13 ERP. One final, key point regarding ERPs: no coverage would have applied in this 
example if both the wrongful act took place and the claim were reported during the 1/1/12–13 ERP period. Rather, the wrongful act must take place during the expired/cancelled policy period for 
coverage to apply during the ERP. 
ERPs and Discovery Pr ovisions Compared 
Often, there is confusion between ERPs and di scovery provisions. The two provisions can be 
distinguished on the following basis: ERPs afford  coverage for claims made after a policy has 
expired. In contrast, discovery provisions apply to  incidents reported to an insurer during a policy 
period, if the incident later matures into a formal claim (and regardless of how far in the future the 
claim is made). 
Coordinating ML/PL Coverage  
There are a number of situations in which ML and PL  coverages must be coordinated, first, with each 
other, and second with non-ML/PL policy forms. Th is discussion will deal only briefly with this 
issue, since it is best left to the profession-specific material in subsequent courses within this series.   
Coordinating ML/PL Polic ies with Each Other 
There are a handful of situations in which decisions must be made as to which type of ML/PL policy should be used to insure a particular exposure.  For example, as was already mentioned, separate 
policy forms are available to cover EPL exposures wh ile, at the same time, D&O forms can also be 
endorsed to do so. Depending upon an insured’s par ticular situation, there may be times in which a 
stand-alone policy should be purchased. On the othe r hand, an EPL endorsement to a D&O form is 
Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
52 sometimes the better approach for covering this risk. This and similar issues will be addressed in the 
profession-specific courses within this series.  
Coordinating PL/ML Policies with Other Types of Policies 
In addition, under certain circumstances, PL/ML forms must be coordinated with other types of 
coverage. For example, the use of Employee Bene fits Liability endorsements available under CGL 
policy forms may be appropriate under certain circum stances. On the other hand, use of a fiduciary 
liability policy form, which in addition to coveri ng fiduciary exposures, also covers the employee 
benefit liability risk, is warranted. Again, this and si milar situations will be examined at length within 
the profession-specific courses in this program.

55 Chapter 5 
The Application Form in Professional and Management Liability Insurance  
An application form must be completed by a pe rson (or institution) seeking PL or ML coverage and 
submitted to an insurer. Information contained within  an application is important because it is used by 
underwriters to decide: (1) whether to insure a given professional liability risk, (2) what coverage 
terms apply, and (3) at what premium. 
Information Contained in Applications 
Applications inquire about several key areas of a professional’s practice or business operations. Using 
a standard application form for architects and e ngineers professional liability insurance as a model, 
Exhibit 5.1 provides examples of both the categories of information and the kinds of specific 
questions contained in appl ications for PL coverage. 
Although no two insurers’ application forms are exact ly alike (even for the same line of PL or ML 
coverage) they all require the insured to provide essentially the same information. Whatever 
differences exist are principally those of form rather than substance. Nevertheless, every insurer has 
its own application form, and many underwriters ar e very particular about obtaining information on 
such forms.

 Chapter 5—The Application Form in Professional and Management Liability 
Insurance 
57 The Significance of the Inform ation within the Application 
The information contained within a PL or ML app lication is significant because (1) the information 
within the application becomes part of the policy;  (2) this information forms the basis upon which a 
policy is written; and (3) the insurer relies upon the tr uth of the information within the application.  
Application Information Incorporated within the Policy 
Information provided within the application becomes part of the policy. This is accomplished by one 
of two approaches:  (1) the application contains wordi ng to the effect that it is incorporated within the 
policy; or (2) the policy contains language stating th at the application will be incorporated within the 
policy.  
Application Information Forms Basi s upon Which Policy Is Written 
Information within an application is considered by  an underwriter to constitute the basis for writing a 
given policy. Items such as the particular design discipline(s) in which an engineering firm is 
engaged, its financial statements, and the professiona l credentials and experience of principals in the 
firm are the basis of the underwriter’s decision to offer coverage. For example, if the application 
noted that the applicant is a soils engineer, rather  than a mechanical engineer, this would produce a 
higher premium. Or, if the application indicated th at the applicant had 20 years’ experience, this 
would produce a lower premium than if the appli cant had recently graduated from engineering school. 
Insurer Relies on Truth of Application Information 
The insurer accepts all statements made in the appli cation as being true. In ot her words, the coverage 
granted is predicated on the assumption that the in formation contained in the application is both 
correct and complete. If such information turns out to  be false or incomplete, the insurer may be able 
to deny coverage for a specific clai m or even void the policy entirely.  
Warranties and Representations 
Information contained in applications for professional liability insurance is classified as being either a 
warranty or a representation. 
What Constitutes a Warranty? 
Warranties are considered to  involve the kinds of critical items that directly affect important elements 
of coverage, such as breadth of insuring conditions, price, and whether an underwriter would have 
provided coverage for a particular insured—to any extent—had he or she been aware of a difference 
in a specific statement contained within the application. For example, an applicant’s prior claim record is generally considered to be a warranty. Thus, if an applicant for architects and engineer’s 
coverage stated that he had a $2 million claim made  against him during the previous year, this would 
clearly have an effect on the nature and price of c overage offered. The genera l rule of warranties is 
that if an insured makes a false statement with respect to a warranty item—or fails to reveal 
information that could be considered a warranty— the insurer can deny coverage for a specific loss 
and/or void the policy entirely.   
   Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
58 What Constitutes a Representation? 
Representations relate to information that is not critical in determining price and coverage terms or 
whether a policy will be offered at all. For example,  assume that a lawyer is practicing in an office 
sharing arrangement, whereby he and another attorn ey share office space but are not partners and are 
therefore not legally liable for each other’s professional’s acts (as would be the case in a partnership). On an application form, the applicant attorney checks the box indicating “sole practitioner” rather 
than checking the box noting “office sharing.” In contrast to the ex ample of the applicant for A&E’s 
coverage above, such information would not aff ect the price and nature of lawyers professional 
liability coverage offered and is  therefore considered a represen tation. The general rule of 
representations is that if an insured makes a false statement or omission with respect to a 
representation, the insurer would not be able to de ny coverage for a specific claim and/or void the 
policy.   
Warranties versus Representations: The Distinctions Can Blur 
Although these two examples demonstrate clear distin ctions between these two terms, there are many 
situations where the distinctions between warranties and representations are blurred. Case in point: 
assume an application asks for the number of years a physician has been practicing. The applicant 
states “10 years” although in reality, she has only been practicing for 5 years. In this situation, some 
insurers might have charged a slightly higher premiu m if they knew that the physician had only been 
practicing for 5 years. On the other hand, a number of  other insurers do not make such distinctions in 
promulgating rates. So the question arises as to whether this is a warranty or a representation. 
The Materiality Standard 
Given the potentially contentious nature of such situations, the distinction between warranties and 
representations within application forms has become  less important in recent years. Accordingly, 
when an insurer seeks to deny coverage for a claim or void the policy entirely, the key question is not 
whether a given statement is a warranty or a repr esentation. Rather, it becomes a question of whether 
or not the statement is material to the risk involved in writing the coverage. The test of materiality is this: if the insurer had received the correct inform ation, rather than what was provided on the 
application, would it have: (1) declined to cover the risk, (2) covered the risk but at a higher premium, 
or (3) covered the risk but on different terms (e.g ., required a higher deductible  or added an additional 
exclusion)? If any of these applies, a statement can be considered “material.”   
Remedies for Providing Material Misinformation or Omitting 
Material Information 
The insurer has available a number of remedies when  an applicant provides material misinformation 
or omits material information within an appli cation for PL or ML coverage. These remedies include: 
(1) rescission, (2) reformation, (3) cancellation, and (4) nonrenewal. 
Rescission 
An insurer may rescind a policy if it discovers that the insured gave material untrue or material 
incomplete answers to questions in the application. If an insurer rescinds a policy, the policy is treated 
as though it never existed. Upon rescinding the policy, the insurer must return the full premium to the 
insured. Chapter 5—The Application Form in Professional and Management Liability 
Insurance 
59 Reformation 
Reformation of the insurance policy is another remedy available to an insurer. Reformation is 
available when a valid policy does not fully or accurately express the agreement of the parties because of fraud, inequitable conduct, or mutual mist ake. When the policy fails to express the parties’ 
intent, a court may reform the policy to express the actual nature of the agreement between the 
parties. For example, in the above example, where the physician misstated the number of years of her professional experience, an insurer could seek to re form the insurance policy to accurately reflect 
such experience and therefore charge a higher premium. 
Cancellation 
Cancellation—the termination of an insurance policy, before its expiration date, by either the insured 
or the insurer—is available to insurers when there has been a material misstatement or omission in the 
application. An insurer’s cancellation of a policy does not void the policy from its inception, as does rescission. Rather, it takes effect only upon the cance llation’s effective date. Thus, an insurer is liable 
for losses occurring before the cancellation. Upon can cellation, the insurer must return the unearned 
premium to the insured. For this reason, and especi ally in certain ML coverage lines, namely D&O 
insurance, where premiums can be as high as $10 m illion or more, insurers often seek to cancel a 
policy rather than to rescind it. This is because when it cancels, an insurer need only return premium 
on a pro-rata basis rather than return the entire premium (as when it rescinds coverage). For example, if a D&O policy premium was $10 million and the te rm was 1/1/10–11, if the policy were canceled 
on 10/1/10, the insurer would only be obligated to return approximately $2.5 million (i.e., 25 percent) 
of the premium. On the other hand, if it rescinded the policy, the insurer would be obligated to return 
the entire $10 million premium.  
Nonrenewal 
Generally, an insurer has the right to decline to re new a policy at the end of the policy period for any 
legal reason. (Nonrenewal occurs when, at the expira tion of an insurance policy, either the insurer or 
the insured decides not to renew the policy for anot her term.) However, this right may be limited by 
provisions in the policy, such as by a notice of nonrenewal provision stating that the insurer must 
provide the insured with a certain number of days’ no tice prior to nonrenewal (usually 30 or 60 days). 
Nonrenewal and the Application 
If a new application is required for a renewal po licy, material misstatements/omissions in that 
application may be sufficient to void the policy. On  the other hand, if the insured is not required to 
complete a new application, the insurer’s renewal is  based on the original application, which can form 
the basis for nonrenewing the policy. It should also  be recognized that some renewal applications 
specifically state that they incorporate information th at was contained within prior applications. If this 
is the case, material misstatements/omissions in prior applications can also void the renewal policy. 
Miscellaneous Issues Relating to Applications 
There are several other issues relating to PL and ML  insurance applications, including (1) using the 
application to give notice of potential claims, (2) severability provisions, and (3) the insured’s duty to 
update applications. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
60 Notice of Potential Claims 
Questions regarding the applicant’s knowledge of pot ential claims comprise some of the most critical 
parts of an application for PL and ML insurance.   
Notice of Potential Claims in the Initial Application 
A typical set of questions reads this way: 
“There has not been nor is there now pendi ng any claim(s) against any person proposed 
for insurance in their capacity of  either Director or Officer of the Corporation.... or its 
Subsidiaries except as follows: (attach complete  details) (if no such claims, check here: 
_______NONE) 
“No person who will be an Insured has knowledge or information of any act, error or 
omission which might give rise to a clai m under the proposed policy except as follows: 
(attach complete details) (if they have no such knowledge or information check here: 
_______NONE) 
This statement is commonly referred to as the “claim warranty.” The question is critical since there will be no coverage for any incidents, circumstances,  or situations indicated in the answer to this 
question, if, in the future, these incidents form the basis for a claim. As a result, it is strongly 
recommended that if the applicant answers “yes” to  any of these questions, the details surrounding 
such circumstances or incidents should be reporte d to the applicant’s current insurer under the 
policy’s discovery provision. Discovery provisions, pr eviously discussed, allow an insured to report 
incidents to an insurer that have the potential to r esult in claims. In the event that such an incident 
does form the basis of a claim, coverage will be afforded under the policy, regardless of how far in 
the future a claim is made in conjunction with th at incident. Since coverage will not be available 
under the policy being applied for, it is imperative to secure coverage for such potential claims under 
the discovery provision of the applicant’s current ML or PL policy.  
Notice of Potential Claims in Renewal Applications 
There usually are no claim-related questions (i.e ., “does the insured know of any incidents or 
circumstances that have the potential to give rise to  a claim in the future?”) on renewal application 
forms. However, in the unusual event that th e question does appear, the insured should make a 
concerted negotiating effort to remove such a question.  
The following example demonstrates why such questi ons could create a coverage gap for the insured. 
An insured was covered by Insurer X during the  1/1/06–07 policy period and by Insurer Y during the 
1/1/07–08 policy period. The retroactive date on Y’ s policy is 1/1/07. Assume that on 9/1/07, the 
insured submits a renewal applica tion for coverage with Insurer X for the 1/1/08–09 period. Also 
assume that during the previous month, the insu red became aware of circumstances that took place 
during the 1/1/06–07 policy period that have the potential to cause a claim in the future. If the insured 
indicates on the renewal application that such circumstances could give rise to a claim, no coverage would apply under the 1/1/08–09 rene wal policy if a claim from these circumstances is made against 
the insured during this period. However, since the 1/ 1/06–07 policy is no longer in effect, it is too late 
to report these circumstances to Insurer X under th at policy’s discovery provision. This is because 
discovery provisions can only be triggered during th e policy period.  In addition, since the incident 
took place prior to the 1/1/07 retroactive date app licable under Y’s policy, the incident cannot be 
reported under the discovery provision applicable und er Y’s policy.  This ex ample demonstrates why 
potential claim questions in renewal policies place in sureds in a “Catch-22 situation” that could Chapter 5—The Application Form in Professional and Management Liability 
Insurance 
61 produce an unfair coverage denial.  For this reason,  insureds should strongly resist such questions in 
renewal applications.  
Severability Provisions 
Severability provisions in PL and ML application fo rms state that the policy will not be rescinded for 
material misstatements in the application, except as to those persons who made the statement or knew 
such statements to be false. Case-in-point: the CEO of a corporation, in completing a D&O 
application, intentionally inflates the company’s prof its for the just-ended fiscal year. However, he is 
the only director or officer who knew of the misstatement. As a result of the severability provision within the application, if a claim is made as a result of this misstatement, coverage will only be voided as to the CEO, but not as respects the company’s other directors or officers, given their lack of 
knowledge of the CEO’s intentional missta tement of material information.  
Insured’s Duty To Update the Application 
The submission of a PL or ML application does not te rminate the applicant’s obligation to reveal all 
relevant information that is material to the risk . Therefore, if a change occurs or the applicant 
discovers new information before the insurer issues the policy, the applicant has a duty to inform the 
insurer of these changes. If the a pplicant fails to update the applicati on, the insurer can refuse to issue 
or void the policy. However, the insured is only obligated to provide such updates prior to the inception of the policy.

the insurer likely classify Kelli’s misstatement? 
a. It is most likely considered an omission. 
b. It is most likely considered a guarantee. 
c. It is most likely considered a representation. 
d. It is most likely considered a warranty. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
62 3. Because its underwriter misunderstood informati on provided in the application, which was 
accurate, a policy issued by Mighty Fortress Insurance Company uses the wrong 
classification in describing the insured’s operations. The policyholder thought the 
classification seemed a bit strange and reported it to the underwriter who agreed to reform the 
policy. This means that:  
a. The entire premium will be refunded to the policyowner. 
b. The policy will be revised to include the correct information. 
c. The policy will be treated as though it never existed. 
d. The insurer will grant indulgence to the polic yholder and allow the error to stand until the 
next renewal. 
4. The application for Warren Tea’s professional liability policy refers to a “claim warranty.” 
Warren’s agent explains to him that a claim warranty is: a. A cut-through provision that permits the po licyholder to proceed directly against the 
reinsurance company if the primary insure r is unable to pay the entire claim. 
b. A provision in the body of the policy guaranteeing that the insurer will pay claims for a 
limited time period after which the warranty expires. 
c. An optional endorsement that extends the discovery period. 
d. A question or statement in the application concerning past claims or incidents that might give rise to a claim. 
 
     
 
   
Answers to Chapter 5 Review Questions

63 Chapter 6 
Underwriting Professional and Management Liability Insurance 
The key point to recognize concerning the rating of ML  and PL insurance is that pricing is not based 
on manual or filed rates. Rather, these coverage lines are normally rated on the basis of each 
individual insurer's experience. Thus, determining premium is a subjective exercise, especially in 
coverage lines for which claim data is based on a small number of insureds and/or the claims data lacks an adequate number of years during which to develop rates. 
Rating Bases 
PL and ML policies use a variety of rating bases, depending upon the type of coverage. These differences are explained in more detail within future courses in this series. Following are several examples of how rating bases vary with the sp ecific type of PL or ML coverage line.  
Architects and engineers (A&E) professional lia bility policies are rated per $1,000 of annual 
professional fees. Lawyers and accountants professional liability policies are priced on a per 
professional basis (also known as “head count”). EPL policies are rated per employee. D&O policies 
are priced on the basis of the insured corporatio n’s assets. Bottom line: the specific rating approach 
used to price PL and ML policies is a function of the individual type of coverage in question.  
Premiums Are Not Subject to Audit 
Few, if any, types of ML or PL policies are subject to audit at the end of the policy period. However, 
when policies are renewed, appropriate premium ad justments are made for the next policy period, 
based on changes in staff size and/or an ticipated revenue for the upcoming year. 
Modification Factors in Pricing 
Insurers use rates that have been developed intern ally (or, in some cases, they devise rates based on 
industry claim experience). In either case, rates are typically subject to a number of modification 
factors. Some of these factors are specific to individual professions and are discussed in subsequent 
courses within this program. In contrast, others are generic and, in many instances, apply across the board to numerous professions. These generic factors are discussed below.  
   Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
64 Professional Specialty 
The specialty in which a professional practices is perhaps the most important rating factor. There is a 
significant variation between the potential frequency and severity of claims across different practice 
disciplines within the same profession. For example, gynecologists pay a much higher rate for 
coverage than do dermatologists. Similarly, atto rneys who specialize in Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) work are subject to higher premiu ms than lawyers whose practices are limited to 
trusts and estates work. High tech companies pay a higher premium per dollar of assets for D&O 
coverage—compared to manufacturing companies—because high tech firms are much more likely to be involved in securities class action lawsuits.  
Mix of Professional Specialties/Services 
Many professional organizations are made up of indi viduals who specialize in a variety of practice 
areas. Thus, the overall “mix” of services provided by such firms also affects premium levels. For instance, an accounting firm that receives 80 pe rcent of its fees from bookkeeping work will pay a 
much lower premium than one for which annua l fees are equal but are generated from a 
corresponding percentage of audit wo rk, an accounting specialty that te nds to generate a much higher 
frequency and severity of claims.  
Practice Location 
Professionals in certain regions of the country generate higher frequency and severity claim rates than those working in other locations. In certain loca tions, their clients hold professionals to higher 
performance standards, and are therefore more inclin ed to sue. Moreover, jury awards in these areas 
tend to be relatively higher than in other regions. All other things being equal, professionals working 
in larger metropolitan areas and heavily urban states (e.g., New York, California, Illinois) pay higher 
rates than those practicing in states with lower urban concentration (e.g., West Virginia, South 
Dakota, Mississippi).  
Type of Client 
Large corporate clients have a greater propensity fo r suing professionals than do relatively smaller 
ones. In addition, professionals serving large corpor ations are often sued by so-called third-party 
plaintiffs, that is, parties who were financially injured as a result of the services the professional 
provided to its client corporation. For example, creditors and shareholders of  Enron Corporation have 
brought massive lawsuits against Arthur Andersen  (Enron's accounting firm), as well as against the 
law firms that represented Enron, alleging that th ese professionals failed to detect Enron’s fraudulent 
business practices, which, in turn , caused these creditors and shareholders to suffer losses. Thus, 
professionals whose clients are mainly large corporate organizations pay higher rates than do 
professionals whose clients are individuals and small businesses.  
Years of Professional Experience 
The extent of a professional’s experience is an important factor in rating PL insurance coverage. Thus, a person who opens a solo law practice a year  out of law school will probably be surcharged. 
On the other hand, if two lawyers who had each been partners at a large law firm for 20 years were to 
start a partnership, such a surcharge would not be  imposed. Similarly, a start-up corporation will pay 
a higher D&O premium, relative to its assets, compar ed to a company that has been in business for 
many years. Chapter 6—Underwriting Professional a nd Management Liability Insurance 
65 Education and Training 
An underwriter’s perception of an insured’s educatio n and training will affect the rate charged for PL 
insurance. For example, doctors who have received degrees from foreign medical schools and 
accountants with less than a year of experience w ould, for example, ordinarily be surcharged. 
Prior Claim History 
As respects prior claim history, underwriters are typically more concerned about frequency than 
severity. A frequency problem, as evidenced by a proclivity for being sued or committing repeated 
professional errors, is more an indication of incomp etence than is a single major claim in which bad 
luck, rather than gross negligence, produces a high dol lar loss. For example, the typical insurer would 
be more likely to cover a surgeon whose one error during the past decade resulted in a patient’s death 
and a million-dollar claim, than a surgeon who has had six smaller claims made against him during the same period of time. In addition to charging a higher-than-usual premium as a result of a poor claim record, insurers also sometimes impose larger-than-normal deductibles/retentions on a 
professional seeking coverage. Situations where a professional’s claim record is especially problematic will sometimes cause the outright rejec tion of a request for coverage.  (When  PL/ML 
underwriters  review an account, they take pa rticular note of  what the professional now does 
differently or what substantive changes have been made in  his or her practice , to prevent  large 
losses in the future.)   
Continuity of Insurer Relationships 
Underwriters are wary of professional firms that ha ve a history of changing  insurers frequently.  
Instability of insurer relationships could mean the in sured is a “price shopper,” in which case, insurers 
will often be reluctant to even provide a quotation.  
Policy Limits 
From an actuarial standpoint, higher limits expose underwriters to higher potential loss payments. However, the cost per unit of c overage drops substantially at the $1 million annual aggregate level. 
This is because of two factors. First, there are underwriting economies of scale once a policy limit reaches a certain point. In other words, the cost of underwriting a policy with a $2 million limit is not 
twice that of underwriting one with a $1 million limit. Second, the higher a policy’s limit, the lower 
the probability that a given claim (or series of claims ) will exhaust that limit. Nevertheless, firms with 
higher coverage limits will, of course, pay more tota l premiums than firms with lower limits (even if 
their cost per $1,000 of insurance is lower). 
Deductible/Retention Level 
The larger the portion of each loss that a firm is w illing to self-insure, the lower the probability that 
an underwriter will be called upon to participate in a loss that contributes to the payment of indemnity 
and defense costs. This, of course, reduces premium rates. Higher deductibles/retentions also provide the insured with added incentive to control losses, which is why underwriters look favorably on firms 
that are willing to accept more than minimal deductibles available.  
   
 Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
66 Extent of Prior Acts Coverage 
Most PL and ML policies provide prior acts coverage , especially for individuals and firms who have 
coverage in place at the time that they change to a new insurer. Policies covering prior acts cover 
claims from acts that took place on or after the da te on which continuous professional or management 
liability coverage was first purchased. The further b ack in time prior acts coverage is provided, the 
greater the underwriter's exposure to claims. Premiu m will therefore be affected by the number of 
years for which prior acts coverage is granted.  
Loss Control Programs 
An underwriter’s perception of a given PL or ML risk  will be influenced by the extent to which the 
applicant for coverage has implemented a robust lo ss control program. Coverage submissions that are 
accompanied by written documentation of such programs will normally receive special, positive consideration. In some cases, an insurer’s rating structure will grant premium credits (generally from 
2 percent to 5 percent) when an insured (or memb ers of the insured’s firm or professional practice) 
has completed specific, loss-control-oriented coursework.  
Competition 
However tight the insurance market may be (in genera l or for a specific line of coverage), insurers are 
always interested in writing a handful of so- called “good” accounts. Profitable, well-established 
professional firms and corporations with favorable loss experience and strong claim control programs 
are usually granted preferred pric ing and coverage terms—especially when other insurers are also 
competing for the business. 
Broker Representation 
The ability of an insured’s broker to “sell” a risk al so plays a role in PL and ML insurance pricing. 
This is especially true in cases where there is a long-standing and successful relationship between the 
insured’s broker and the underwriter. The total pr emium volume written through a particular agent or 
broker, as well as the agent/broker’s loss ratio on business written for the insurer, can also 
significantly influence premiums.

Professional and Management Liability Risk Control 
Despite the fact that professionals or professional organizations have purchased liability coverage for 
their activities or services, they are nevertheless exposed to a number of potentially uninsured losses 
when a claim is made against them. The following pages analyze the nature of these losses and 
provide suggestions for reducing the exposures to cl aims in which errors or omissions are alleged 
against a professional or corporation. 
Reasons for Risk Control 
Professionals and corporations have multiple in centives to reduce the incidence of claims made 
against them.   
Damage to Professional or Corporate Reputation 
PL and ML claims, are, by their very nature, an assertion that a professional’s or corporation’s work 
failed to meet the standards required by the profession or industry. Claims can damage a 
professional’s or corporation’s reputation, which has three important negative consequences: (1) 
inability to obtain repeat business, (2) inability to obtain referrals , and (3) damage to corporate 
reputations. One specific problem encountered by “institutional” professional risks is that claims 
against them make it more difficult to locate the kinds of highly experienced businesspeople who 
would be willing to serve on the organization’s board of directors.  
Disruption of Internal Productivity 
Despite the availability of funds from an insurer to  pay settlement and legal costs, the process of 
defending claims requires professionals and execu tives to burn up considerable time and effort. 
Internal examination and analysis of the work that  caused a claim, depositions, strategy meetings with 
insurers and attorneys, attendance at trials, and extended settlement conferences require the expenditure of substantial resources. While the approximate dollar cost of a professional’s or corporate executive’s time can generally be measured, the demoralizing effects of claims are not only 
much more difficult to measure, but, depending upon the situation, can sometimes prove equally if 
not even more costly. Take, for example, the mora le problems that result when a manager must assist 
in the defense of a sexual harassment claim made against him by one of his employees. Productivity 
in the affected department will be impaired for the duration of the period in which the claim is 
pending and may, in fact, never return to its prior level even after the claim is resolved, given the loss 
of trust between the manager and his em ployees, owing to the litigation process. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
70 Absorption of Deductibles/Se lf-Insured Retentions 
Since PL and ML policies are normally written with deductibles/self-insured retentions, the insured 
will almost always be required to bear some porti on of every claim, even in situations where the 
professional or corporation is completely absolved of liability. For example, assume a law firm is 
sued but the case is dismissed on a summary judgm ent basis. Also assume that the law firm 
maintained a $10,000 deductible under its PL policy. In  this situation, it is likely that the defense 
costs required to obtain the dismissal approximated $1 0,000, costs that were paid for entirely by the 
insured—rather than by the insurer.  
Future Premium and Deduc tible Level Increases 
PL and ML insurance is not rated on a formalized  experience basis. Rather, underwriters price 
policies using a number of rating factors but do not  apply a specific “experience modifier,” as is the 
case with workers compensation or general liability in surance. However, in the long run, premiums 
are significantly affected by an insured’s loss ratio . Absent a favorable loss record, an insured faces 
almost certain future premium and deductible in creases, especially in ha rd insurance markets. 
Avoidance of Cancellation or Nonrenewal 
A favorable loss record is necessar y to forestall the possibility of having a PL or ML policy canceled 
or nonrenewed. This is especially important becau se almost all types of ML and PL coverage is 
written on a claims-made basis. Although insurers norma lly provide insureds with the opportunity to 
buy extended reporting period coverage when the insurer initiates the cancellation or nonrenewal, 
such endorsements are usually expens ive. Alternatively, when a replacement insurer agrees to provide 
full prior acts coverage (thereby eliminating the need to buy an extended reporting period 
endorsement), such a concession is normally reflected by a higher level of premium charged.  
Exclusion of Coverage for Certain Claim Types 
If an insured has had previous claims of a certain ty pe made against it, there is a possibility that under 
future policies, such claims will now be excluded. For example, if a D&O insured is sued based upon 
a restatement of its financial data, it is very possi ble that under future D&O liability policies, that the 
insurer will now exclude coverage fo r financial restatement claims.  
Cost of Potential Insurer Insolvency 
Even if a claim is covered under the terms of a PL or ML insurance policy, there is no guarantee that 
the insurer will have the financial ability to pay se ttlement and defense costs on the insured’s behalf. 
This is especially true considering the long tail that characterizes PL and ML claims. Under such 
circumstances, an insurer that w as solvent at the time a policy was written may be in a much different 
position 10 to 15 years later, when a claim is finally  settled. Case-in-point: up until only a year or two 
prior to its bankruptcy, Kemper had been one of the country’s most stable and respected professional 
liability insurers. 
Inability To Offer Competitively Priced Services 
Liability insurance costs are a major cost component  in most kinds of professional practices and 
corporations. Thus, professional firms, individual practitioners, and corporations unable to control risks will be adversely affected by premium increa ses that must be built into the firm’s or the 
practice’s cost structure. Ultimately, this mak es it more difficult to offer professional services or 
products at competitive prices.  Chapter 7—Professional and Manage ment Liability Risk Control 
71 Reduced Coverage Availability 
Availability crises have long been a fact of life in PL and ML insurance. When such crises make 
coverage more difficult to obtain, firms with poor cl aim histories will be more adversely affected in 
terms of premium levels and breadth  of coverage offered, compared to those with good loss records.  
Professional and Management Li ability Risk Control Techniques 
While the activities of lawyers, doctors, accountants, architects, corporate executives, and other 
professionals may vary significantly, many of the business operations associated with these 
professions are essentially the same. Consequently, there are a number of risk control measures that 
pertain equally well to all types of professions a nd corporate organizations. Universally applicable 
risk control techniques are discussed in this section.  Risk control approaches relevant only to specific 
professionals or specific types of ML coverage are discussed in other courses within this program. 
Develop a Clearly Defined Scope of Services 
Professionals should develop standard forms describi ng the exact nature of their intended services in 
plain, unambiguous language. Adherence to th ese guidelines will assist in providing a strong 
affirmative defense if a client alleges that the professional has not lived up to prior commitments, which in fact, may never have been made at any time. 
Commit Oral Agreements to Writing 
A great many misunderstandings (which later become formal claims) can be avoided if written documentation is created and retained. This is esp ecially important when the verbal instructions 
involve (1) changes in the initially agreed-upon scope  of services, (2) changes in the original fees for 
those services, and (3) instructions from clients which give the professional the authority to pursue a specific course of action on the client’s behalf (e.g., allowing an attorney to accept any settlement 
offer of $100,000 or more).  
Document All File Activity 
Thorough, accurate file documenta tion will often provide a professional firm with its strongest single 
piece of evidence that services were properly performed. Documentation is so important that, in some 
firms, the detail with which professional employees record their activities in client, case, or project 
files is considered in periodic performance  reviews. Such documentation also assists in 
preventing/mitigating D&O liability claims, wherein careful recording of conversations and decisions made at board of directors meetings can be si milarly effective in defending claims. Finally, 
documentation in the form of thorough information w ithin employee personnel files is also useful in 
refuting allegations of wrongful employment practices. 
Conduct Peer Reviews 
Although the peer review process requires expending considerable time and effort, the long-run cost 
savings produced by avoiding claims can be m eaningful. Accordingly, peer reviews should be 
conducted on every major engagement, with the wo rk being reviewed by at least one professional 
who did not personally perform it. In larger orga nizations, it is a common practice to describe the 
procedures for peer review in a formalized quality control manual. Such documents note the types of 
work to be peer reviewed, and are distributed to and discussed periodically with all professional 
employees. Peer review is especially important on large-scale service projects in which the bulk of the work has been performed by l ess experienced members of a firm.  Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
72 Maintain Reasonable Workloads 
Stress caused by unreasonable workloads can produ ce professional errors. Accordingly, professional 
firms should continually evaluate and maintain reasonable levels of work per individual. An overload 
of clients, files, or projects can cause the kinds of undue stress, fatigue, or even depression which 
ultimately lead to mistakes. To counteract this tendency, some professional firms periodically review 
workloads in an effort to ensure a fair division of labor. Others actually require that firm members 
and employees take a minimum number of vacation days each year.  
Consult Specialists If Necessary 
On projects, cases, and engagements that are outside the professional’s area of expertise or are especially complex, the possibility of hiring an outsid e firm or expert to review the work should be 
considered. Practice areas within many professions are becoming increasingly specialized. Thus, consultation with practitioners who concentrate in  a more narrowly defined specialty is often 
necessary to avoid allegations that the professional’s services were not in keeping with state-of-the-art practices. Similarly, there will be situations in  which a professional, given a complete lack of 
expertise in an area required by a potential client , would be prudent to refer the person to another 
professional or simply forgo the opportunity to provide services. 
Conduct Quality Control Audits 
Claims can sometimes be prevented by periodic audits of a firm’s operations. For example, once each year, an outside consultant might review an in surance agency’s files and processing procedures. 
Audits of this type can be conducted by either internal or external personnel in an attempt to discern specific problems regarding ongoing work or as respects general professional practices and methods. 
Some insurers believe that audits of this kind are extremely valuable, and, in certain situations, they 
may grant premium credits to firms that undergo su ch audits on a periodic basis. In some cases, 
insurers will only write cove rage on a firm subject to a satisfactory audit. In other instances, insurers 
provide their insureds with audits as a so-called “value added” service. (This approach is most common among insurers writing EPL insurance.) 
Encourage Continuing Professional Education 
Depending on the individual profession, in many states a stipulated minimum annual number of hours 
of continuing education must be completed for a professional to maintain certification in his or her 
specialty. However, many indi vidual professional firm s go beyond such requirements and mandate 
even higher levels of continuing professional education. Continuing education exposes professionals 
to the latest advances in their field, thereby re ducing the possibility for errors in performing their 
work, as well as assisting in defense of claims allegi ng that their work did not meet state-of-the art 
standards. A number of insurers’ professional liab ility application forms ask specific questions 
regarding the extent to which professionals with in a firm pursue continuing education activities. 
Avoid Making Warranties or Performance Guarantees 
Claims against professionals frequently emanate from allegations that they breached express warranties in performing their services. Whenever possible, professionals should not provide any statements, either orally or in writing, that c ould be construed as warranties concerning their work. 
Nor should professionals guarantee a specific outcome or result with respect to their proposed 
services. Often, claims arise because a professional gene rated false client hopes that were not realized Chapter 7—Professional and Manage ment Liability Risk Control 
73 at the conclusion of an engagement or service—even though the work was performed in a highly 
professional manner.  
Require Alternative Dispute Resolution Approaches 
Where possible, professionals should attempt to insert provisions in contracts with clients requiring 
both parties to seek resolution of disputes by media tion or arbitration, prior to filing a lawsuit. 
Problems resulting from professional services can often be resolved by mediation (or other alternative 
dispute resolution techniques) rather than resorting to formal litigation, which is almost always more 
expensive and time-consuming. More over, a few insurers provide premium credits to insureds whose 
standard contract requires that clients submit dis putes associated with the professional’s work to 
alternative dispute resolution, rather than the standard—and much more costly—litigation process.  
Screen New Clients 
Some organizations/individuals are more prone than others to sue or be sued. Persons and firms that are heavily leveraged will generally be more inc lined to make a claim against a professional than 
those that are not. Similarly, professionals s hould think twice about establishing a professional 
relationship if it appears that the client will have a problem paying for services. Professional organizations should avoid working with those who have sued other professionals in the past, because 
this indicates a pattern likely to continue. 
Negotiate and Explain Fees in Advance 
Many suits against professionals result from mis understandings about fees—some of which would 
have been avoided if early clarification had been  provided. Therefore, fees should be discussed in 
detail during the initial client meeting. Although it is  often difficult to propose a fixed price for many 
types of services at the outset of a professional relationship, the basis on which fees are computed 
should be explained (e.g., the professional’s hourly rate). Depending upon the circumstances, it is 
sometimes a good idea for a professional to request a retainer once a client has decided to engage the 
professional but before the actual work or ser vice has commenced. A client’s inability or 
unwillingness to provide such a retainer could indicate that the client will have future difficulties in 
paying for services—or might predict other kinds of problems—if the relationship continues. 
Bill Clients Monthly and Discuss Payment Problems with Them 
Aside from simply being good business practice, timely fee collection is also helpful in preventing lawsuits. Often, late payments can be early warni ng signs of client financial problems—the kind that 
increase the likelihood that the client will bring a lawsuit against the professional. If there is dissatisfaction with the nature of the work (or the size of the fee), frank discussion is the best way to 
resolve the problem. Early interaction could reveal that services were not initially up to standard, but 
are rectifiable nonetheless. On the other hand, failure  to pay could indicate that the client is having 
financial problems, in which case, an extended payment plan should be discussed.   
Keep Clients Informed with Periodic Status Reports 
A lack of communication sometimes makes clients f eel that the professional has been lax in making 
sufficient efforts on their behalf, despite the fact th at the inherent nature of the process—rather than 
lack of effort—is responsible for delays. For example, to an injured plaintiff, personal injury lawsuits involve seemingly interminable delays, despite the be st efforts of attorneys. Regular progress reports 
can avoid claims produced by client dissatisfacti on caused by extended resolution periods in such Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
74 situations. Accordingly, it is usually a good idea to “copy” a client on correspondence and on 
documents that relate to services be ing performed on his or her behalf. 
Avoid Conflicts of Interest 
Obvious conflicts of interest are relatively easy to identify (e.g., an  attorney should not represent both 
parties in a divorce). The difficult problems, however, are those in which conflicts of interest are 
more subtle. For instance, if a senior partner of an accounting firm has a close personal relationship 
with the chief executive officer of a major competitor of one of its audit clients, this may or may not 
compromise the firm's independence. Conflicts of in terest should also be avoided with respect to 
selecting persons to serve on corporate boards of directors. For example, if a pharmaceutical corporation provides a substantial annual donation to a medical research foundation, the director of 
the foundation should not be asked to serve on the corporation’s board. 
Preserve Client Confidentiality 
It is always important to preserve the confidential na ture of the client-professional relationship. Even 
in situations where it is common practice to release cl ient-specific information to third parties, clients 
should be advised and requested to “sign off” wh en professionals receive such requests. Claims 
involving breaches of confidentiality are especially prev alent with respect to the medical professions.

Professional and Management Liability Claims Management 
Professional liability claim management is a unique area of insurance claim responsibilities. Adjusters 
managing professional liability claims must adopt a di fferent perspective compared to that employed 
when handling other types of claims. 
Unique Management Aspects 
Professional liability claims analysis and resolution is  more man-hour intensive than most other lines 
of insurance. While a competent claims adjuster can conduct field i nvestigations of several routine 
claims per day, this is not the case in the professi onal liability arena. Investigating a single claim and 
meeting with an insured can last the better part of a day—or more—depending on the complexity of 
the claim, the profession involved, and the amount of  documentation that needs to be reviewed. In 
contrast, general liability or workers compensation claims typically require relatively little field 
documentation because often the claim arises out of a simple error or accident, such as a slip-and-fall 
on a wet floor. These types of claims do not have the factual complexity associated with them as do 
professional liability claims. While general liability claim department s may allow examiners to have 
250 (or more) claims on active diary, it is not uncommon for an insurer to limit professional liability claims to 150 or fewer per adjuster. 
Settlement Sensitivity 
Adjusters and attorneys handling PL and ML claims must also reorient their thinking as respects 
settlements. Although first-call settle ments and expedited claim resolu tions are popular in concluding 
automobile and premises liability claims, this mi nd-set can be disastrous in handling professional 
liability losses. Indeed, PL and ML claims are sensitive , since they deal with reputations. Further, as 
already noted in this course, virtually all PL and ML policies require the insured’s consent to settle. 
Resolving claims without permission may expose the insurer or adjuster to what is known as a “bad 
faith” claim from the policyholder.  
Professional Liability Claims Ad justing: A Specialized Area 
It is also important to select an investigative adjusting service or third-party administrator (TPA) 
skilled at handling professional liability claims. This  is easier said than done, however, because few 
adjusting companies fit the bill. Professional liabilit y loss adjustment is a specialty. The ordinary 
independent adjusting service (or adjuster) receiv es such an assignment only once in the proverbial 
blue moon. Nor is such expertise a skill necessar ily transferable from one type of professional Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
78 liability loss to another. While certain principl es of professional liability claims management are 
generic, the nuts and bolts of claims handling and investigation are not. For example, proficiency in 
adjusting architects and engineers liability claims does not necessarily translat e into skill in handling 
a medical malpractice lawsuit or a shareholder suit against an accounting firm that supposedly 
botched a financial audit. 
The Use of Attorneys  
Due to the specialized nature of professional liabilit y claims, coupled with the scarcity of professional 
liability expertise among adjusting firms, a number of insurers designate attorneys—in-house or 
outside counsel—to handle professional liability claims . Some programs restrict professional liability 
claims handling to adjusters holding law degrees. Fo r example, the American Psychiatric Association 
operates a professional liability program for member psychiatrists. Most of its claims staff consists of 
in-house attorneys.  
Outside Counsel Selection 
In addition to the adjuster who is either employed  by the insurer or an independent adjuster who 
represents the insurer, professional liability claims al so usually require the hiring of outside defense 
counsel.  Selecting counsel is a critical decision because defending professional liability claims is a 
demanding specialty; an all-purpose insurance defens e firm, popular with many insurers, may not be 
the best choice for defending a professional liability case.  Failure to select counsel with expertise and 
experience in defending such claims may hamper the defense of the professional, raise defense costs, 
and even expose the insurer or claims manager to professional liability for inept claim handling. 
Unique Coverage Issues 
Frequently, PL and ML claims raise issues of insurance coverage. Sources of concern over “gray 
areas” of coverage include the following. 
• Demands for punitive damages when the PL/ML policy excludes them, or, if the jurisdiction 
in which the claim is made, as a matter of pub lic policy, does not allow an insurer to pay 
punitive damages claims. 
• Allegations of fraud, assault, criminal acts, or intentional acts which might exclude coverage for the claim.  
• Coverage conflicts when intentional conduct precludes coverage  for one, but not all insured 
persons. This is an especially acute problem in D&O claims, when one or more insureds have 
committed fraud, and other “innocen t insureds” must be defended. 
• Situations in which some, but not all, allegations that are part of a claim, are covered by the policy. 
• Coverage trigger issues, involving questions as to which claims-made policy, in a series of policies, is responsible for covering a claim.  
 
  Chapter 8—Professional and Manageme nt Liability Claims Management 
79 Diminishing Limits Issues 
Another key issue associated with PL and ML claims management is the problem of diminishing 
limits. Given the fact that the expenditure of  defense costs reduces policy limits under PL and ML 
forms, both defense counsel and the insurer must keep the insured adequate ly informed as to the 
amounts of: (1) defense monies already expended, (2 ) future, anticipated defense expenses, and (3) 
remaining limits. Defense counsel must be especia lly sensitive to this issue since failure to 
communicate with the insured on such matters could lead to a bad faith allegation by the insured against the insurer and a professional liabilit y claim against the defense attorney.  
To Whom Does Defense Counsel Owe Its Primary Allegiance? 
It has long been held that defense counsel, alt hough retained by the insurance company, owes its 
primary duty and obligation of professional services to the client-insured, which is traditionally 
defined as being the policyholder—not the insuran ce company paying the attorney’s bill. Thus, 
defense attorneys must demonstrate that in provid ing a full and complete defense to the policyholder, 
they did not wastefully incur expenses in defending the policyholder, thereby reducing remaining policy limits. However, exercising this duty has the potential to create a conflict of interest between 
the insurance company, defense counsel, and polic yholder and is sometimes the source of significant 
claim problems disputes. 
Communication Issues 
As already noted, excellent communication between the claims department and the policyholder is needed so that the policyholder is kept abreast of what is occurring and what decision-making process 
is taking place behind the scenes. In addition, it is  usually necessary for the insurance company to 
seek the insured’s assistance and input during settle ment negotiations. Moreove r, as has already been 
discussed, the policyholder has the right to make  the decision as to whether or not a nuisance 
settlement—or any settlement—should be agreed upon with a claimant, or , alternatively, if the claim 
should be defended. Whether of the nuisance variety or not, the insured must be kept fully informed 
of all developments relevant to the claim, especia lly in those instances where policy language requires 
his consent to settle (which is the case under the vast majority of PL and ML policy forms). 
Trial Strategy Issues 
Additional diminishing lim its problems often arise when proceeding to trial. Such controversies occur 
when, on the eve of a trial, reserves set aside to pay a given claim, exceed the available remaining policy limits. Under these circumstances, there may not be enough money ava ilable to pay both an 
adverse verdict and defense counsel's fee. Complicat ions could also result if defense counsel seeks a 
guarantee of payment for its legal services from th e insurer in the event of an adverse verdict 
exceeding the remaining policy limits. Since, under su ch circumstances, the insurer is effectively 
being asked by defense counsel to increase the limit of the policy covering the claim, this is yet another situation that is ripe for controversy. 
A final problematic trial strategy scenario arises if the insurer refuses to make such a guarantee, 
prompting counsel’s withdrawal on the eve of trial. Certainly, numerous bad faith and professional liability exposures could arise. This scenario beco mes even more complex when there are other, 
unrelated, claims pending against an insured that al so involve the applicable policy and its limits. In 
this situation, the outcome of the claim proceeding to trial could affect the availability of future funds for payment and defense of these other pending claims. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
80 Settlement Issues 
Claims professionals must practice the art of “se lling” when communicating the wisdom of settlement 
to reluctant professionals. When reputations are cha llenged, emotions run high. There is a tendency 
for insured professionals to want to “fight all the way to the Supreme Court.” Accordingly, attorneys 
and adjusters must explain tactfully, but forcef ully, why settlement is often prudent: the jury 
sympathy risk, the possibility of a runaway ve rdict, the attendant negative publicity, and the 
continued drain on the professional’s time and ener gy that must be expended in defending the case. 
Chapter 8 Review Questions  
1. As compared with other liability claims , professional liability claims generally: 
a. Can be settled more quickly.  
b. Can be settled without consulting the policyholder. 
c. Require less of an adjuster’s time because facts are clearly documented. 
d. Require more of an adjuster’s time due to their complexity. 
2. Determining coverage for professional and mana gment liability insurance claims frequently 
involves all the following “gray areas” except:  
a. Whether coverage applies to a punitive damages award. 
b. Allegations of wrongdoing that might preclude coverage. 
c. Which of a series of claims-made policies is triggered. 
d. Situations in which all allegations are within the scope of coverage. 
3. With respect to the settling of a claim, how much communication should there be between the 
claims department and the professiona l liability policyholder (insured)?  
a. In most cases, the policyholder need not  consent to any settlement unless the amount 
exceeds policy limits. So the claims department need not be in contact with the insured. 
b. The claims department should keep the policyholder abreast of any behind-the-scenes decision making process. 
c. The policyholder’s assistance and input is rarely needed during settlement negotiations. So the claims department need not be in contact with the insured. 
d. To avoid collusion, the claims department  should withhold settlement details from the 
policyholder until the claimant has agreed on an amount that will settle the claim. 
Answers to Chapter 8 Review Questions 
1. d. Professional liability claims analysis and resolution is more man-hour-intensive than most other 
lines of insurance, and investigating a single cl aim can last the better part of a day—or longer. 
2. d. Situations in which all allegations are within scope of coverage may involve questions of fact but 
present no gray areas of coverage. 
3. b. Excellent communication between the claims department and the policyholder is needed so that the policyholder is kept abreast of what is occurring.
  
81 Chapter 9 
The Professional Liability and Management Liability Insurance Marketplace 
Although many types of PL and ML insurance coverage are written by admitted insurers in the 
“standard” marketplace, a great deal is also provide d by a variety of so-called alternative markets. 
These markets include: excess and surp lus lines insurers, insurance exch anges, captives/risk retention 
groups, and risk purchasing groups. This chapter will examine these types of markets.  
Excess and Surplus Lines 
Admitted insurers  are licensed by regulators in a given state to do business in that state. They are 
required to make rate and form filings in accord ance with that state’s insurance laws. Admitted 
insurers comprise the so-called “standard” market. 
In contrast, nonadmitted insurers  are insurers that are neither licensed nor registered to do business in 
a given state. (These insurers often write unusual or  “niche” business typically not subject to as much 
insurance regulation as are other types of coverage.) However, many states have what are known as “white  lists” of excess and surplus lines insurers who 
are approved to write coverage in their jurisdictions. Nonadmitted insurers are part of the excess and 
surplus lines insurance market and can also  sometimes called “ nonstandard” insurers. 
The Need for Excess and Surplus (E&S) Lines Insurance 
The types of risks typically in sured in the excess and surplus lines marketplace can usually be 
categorized as substandard risks, e.g., risks with adverse loss experience, unusual risks, and risks for 
which there is a shortage of capacity within the standard market. 
PL and ML insurance involves unique risks. During the 1970s and 1980s when capacity in the 
standard marketplace for such coverage was limite d, PL and ML coverage was frequently written in 
the excess and surplus lines marketplace. Now, however, there is abundant capacity, and the standard market has accommodated the types of risks th at were once the domain of the E&S market. 
 
  Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
82 The Excess and Surplus Lines Market 
Despite the overall soft insurance market, the dom estic excess and surplus lines insurance market 
continues to grow, albeit slowly.  Most of the growth in surplus lines during th e past several years has 
been in professional lines. Specifically, this growth has been in two areas: first, in a variety of new 
miscellaneous errors and omissions (E&O) clas ses of business and second, in employment practices 
liability coverage. 
The Regulatory Environment for Excess and Surplus Lines 
Excess and surplus lines markets are characterized by freedom from regulation, which has two 
effects: (1) insurers can set premiums for coverage  as they see fit and (2) they can offer policy forms 
on a nonstandardized and often case-by-case basis. 
If such coverage were written in the admitted ma rketplace, underwriters would be forced by state 
insurance codes to adhere to a more standardized rating methodology and to use only policy forms 
that have been filed with state regulators. In cont rast, the minimal regulation of the excess and surplus 
lines marketplace gives PL and ML liability underwriters the flexibility they need  to write specialized 
lines of coverage. In fact, many lines of PL and ML insurance would probably be unavailable if this marketplace did not exist. 
Although the excess and surplus lines market is basi cally unregulated as respects forms and rate 
filings, state surplus lines laws do affect, among other things, taxation, licensing, and what companies 
are permitted to write insurance on a nonadmitted basis in that state. 
Distribution System for Excess and Surplus Lines 
The marketing structure for excess and surplus lines is unique in that such coverage is often sold by 
wholesalers. In standard lines of insurance written th rough the American agency system, a retail agent 
generally operates as an intermediary between th e insured and the marketplace. However, in the 
excess and surplus lines marketplace, a wholesaler of ten acts as an intermediary between the retail 
agent and the insurer(s) and has no di rect contact with the insured. 
Types of Wholesalers 
Wholesalers can be classified into two categor ies: the wholesale surplus lines broker and the 
managing general agent. 
The wholesale surplus lines broker  (usually called a surplus lines br oker) works with the retail agent 
and the insurer to procure insurance for the retail agent’s client-insured. However, surplus lines 
brokers do not have underwriting or  binding authority from the insurer(s) with whom they deal.  
Surplus lines brokers may work indepe ndently of the insurers with w hom they place coverage or they 
may be owned by the surplus lines insurer. 
The managing general agent (MGA)  also acts as an intermediary, but has the authority to produce and 
underwrite business for certain insurers. MGAs perfo rm certain functions ordinarily performed only 
by insurers, such as binding coverage, underwriti ng and pricing, appointing retail agents within a 
particular area, and handling claims. 
The Need for Wholesalers 
The question often arises as to why a wholesaler is needed in the excess and surplus lines market, 
since, as some believe, this intermediary adds unnecessary cost to the insurance product. In recent 
years, some excess and surplus insurers have byp assed the wholesaler, instead, marketing directly to Chapter 9—The Professional Liability and Management Liability 
Insurance Marketplace 
83 the retail agent. However, the inherent specializa tion of the surplus lines market helps explain the 
necessity of wholesalers, which are usually staffed by individuals with expertise in particular classes 
of business. 
Many retail agents do not work with certain lines of professional liability insurance frequently enough 
to develop a significant amount of expertise in these lines. A knowledgeable wholesaler can provide 
these agents with the expertise to write accounts th ey would otherwise be unable to handle properly. 
The wholesaler can help prepare a professional underwriting submission, identify markets to 
approach, analyze the coverage quoted, and explain the coverage particulars to the retail agent. 
Alternatives to Wholesalers 
It should be recognized that an insured does not necessarily have to utilize a wholesaler to reach a 
nonadmitted insurer. Retailers associated with large brokerage houses often work directly with the excess and surplus lines market, including alien and fo reign insurers, to procure coverage in the 
nonadmitted market. (Alien insurers ar e insurers domiciled outside the United States. Foreign insurers 
do business in a state other than the one where they are domiciled.) Thus, surplus lines insurers may accept business directly from the retail agent, work exclusively with either surplus lines brokers or 
MGAs, or accept business from both types of agents  or brokers, depending on the risk. Exhibit 9.1 
illustrates some of the ways a risk can be placed with a surplus lines insu rer. In addition, other 
intermediaries can be involved in the process, typically at additional cost to the insured.

Possible Surplus Lines Distribution Systems 
Lloyd’s of London 
Lloyd’s of London, the world's oldest, largest, and most well known insurance exchange writes a 
considerable amount of PL and ML  coverage. Lloyd’s began more than 300 years ago when, over 
cups of coffee at various coffee houses in London, merchants, ship owners, and captains exchanged 
and assumed maritime-related risks. Much of the c onfusion surrounding Lloyd’s stems from the fact 
that Lloyd’s is not an insurance company—it is an international insura nce exchange connecting 
buyers and sellers of insurance. Lloyd’s is ma de up of wealthy active and inactive members—called 
names—who form groups called syndicates to underw rite everything from specific risks to entire 
books of business.  
Syndicates 
Syndicates vary in size and specialty. The cove rages written by Lloyd’s are categorized as 
professional indemnity, aviation, catastrophe, marine , and motor. Professional liability coverage is 
usually written by nonmarine syndicates. Syndicates typi cally specialize in one of these areas or in a 
particular facet of one of these areas, such as crime or aviation insurance. Names often join a number 
Chapter 9—The Professional Liability and Management Liability 
Insurance Marketplace 
85 of syndicates who take very sma ll portions of a large number of risks. By assuming a modest 
premium limit from a number of syndicates, the member spreads its risk of being adversely affected 
by the poor loss experience from a particular synd icate or a general book of business. Lloyd’s names 
are typically not insurance people; they are well-to-do individuals who use their “names” to support a promise to pay in the event of a loss.  (How ever, in the past decade, Lloyd’s has allowed 
corporations, including U.S. corporations, to partic ipate as “names.”) Due to their lack of insurance 
expertise, members agencies look after individual members’ personal investments in the syndicate. 
They do not manage the syndicate. These agencies have the insurance background and the experience necessary to negotiate placements on desirable syndi cates. They are paid a low fixed fee plus a 
percentage of profits accruing to members.  
Lloyd’s and U.S. Risks 
For U.S.-based insureds, Lloyd’s of London is a major market for risks requiring large capacity, specialty coverages, nonstandard or unusual risk s, and reinsurance. A substantial amount of 
professional liability insurance is written by Lloyd’ s. In the United States, Lloyd’s operates on a 
nonadmitted basis, except for Illinois and Kentucky , where it functions as an admitted market. To 
safeguard its American operations, the American  Trust Fund was established with more than $5 
billion in cash and U.S. government securities. Acce ss to Lloyd’s is through accredited brokers who 
secure U.S. business from an excess and surplus lin es agent (a “coverholder” or “correspondent”). 
Captives, Risk Retention Groups, and Risk Purchasing Groups 
Passage of the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 (L RRA) has been the catalyst to the formation of 
numerous alternative risk financing arrangement s for professional liability coverage. The Act was 
passed in response to the hard market conditions that characterized liability coverages during the mid-1980s. The purpose of the Act was to make liability insu rance coverage of nearly all types (other than 
personal lines liability, workers compensation, and em ployers liability) more available and affordable 
to businesses that were having difficulty in obtaining it . The Act authorized firms to band together for 
the purpose of obtaining liability insurance cove rage, via risk retention groups (RRGs) and 
purchasing groups (PGs). Although a handful of cap tive insurers had been established during the 
medical malpractice crisis of the 1970s, the Act fost ered explosive growth in the development of so-
called alternative risk financing facilities. 
Captives and RRGs are basically small insurance comp anies owned either by their policyholders or 
by an association to which their policyholders bel ong. In contrast, PGs are not risk bearers. Unlike 
captives and RRGs, they are not required to capitali ze to or reinsure the entity, because they are 
merely groups of insureds who band together to  purchase coverage from an insurance company. 
Captives 
A captive insurer is an entity cr eated to insure the loss exposures of its founding organizations. A 
well-accepted definitio n of a “captive” is: 
A closely-held insurer whose business is primarily supplied by and controlled by its 
owners, and in which the original insureds are the principal beneficiaries.  
Nearly all captives writing professional liability coverage are group captives. These entities are owned by multiple, nonrelated organizations (policyholders) and are designed to insure the risks of 
these different entities. Professional and Management Liability: Exposures and Insu rance Coverage 
86 Risk Retention Groups 
Risk retention groups (RRGs) are actually a type or subset of captive insurer. Except for two key 
differences, they operate in a very similar manner. First, unlike traditional captives, RRGs are not 
subject to individual state laws which would othe rwise prohibit the formation of group captives or 
make it difficult to form or operate them. Second, once a RRG group is licensed in a single state, licensing in any other state is not required to do  business. For these reasons, RRGs have become 
much more popular vehicles for writing professional liability coverage, compared to traditional captives. 
Purchasing Groups 
The LRRA also authorized the establishment of pur chasing groups (PGs). PGs are groups formed to 
obtain liability coverage for its members, all of whom must have similar or  related exposures. The 
Act requires a PG to be domiciled in a specific stat e. In contrast to RRGs, PGs are not risk-bearing 
entities. Accordingly, they are not required to cap italize or reinsure the entity, as RRGs must. Thus, 
PGs are easier to form, which is demonstrated by the fact that an RRG may require as long as 18 months to implement. In contrast, PGs can achieve full operation in as little as 60 days.  
Most PL/ML PGs purchase coverage in one of the following four categories. 
• Errors and omissions (E&O) risks (e.g., pension actuaries, real estate appraisers, 
bankruptcy trustees, court reporters, claims adju sters, computer consultants, executive search 
firms, travel agents)  
• Specialists within a traditional profession  (e.g., pediatric dentists, radiologists, cosmetic 
surgeons, intellectual property attorneys, military physicians, structural engineers)  
• Allied health care professionals (e.g., mental health counselors, pharmacists, nurse anesthetists, acupuncturists, substance abuse professionals, nutritionists)  
• Members of a specific professional organization  (e.g., lawyers who are members of the 
Defense Research Institute, dentists who are me mbers of the Minnesota Dental Association, 
real estate agents who are members of the National Association of Realtors, veterinarians who are members of the American Veterinary Medical Association)  
A review of these categories indicates the value-a dded nature of the prof essional liability coverage 
provided by PGs. First, they facilitate the devel opment of highly specialized, tailored policy forms 
ordinarily beyond the scope of what is available in the traditional marketplace. Moreover, the fact that 
an insurer can deal with an associa tion, rather than individual, allows  relatively small insureds to reap 
the benefits of underwriting and administrative ec onomies of scale, and ultimately, substantial 
premium reduction for its policyholders.
