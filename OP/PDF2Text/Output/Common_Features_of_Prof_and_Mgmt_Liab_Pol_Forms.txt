1 Chapter 1 
Course Overview and Introduction 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This WebCE course is designed to provide a modera tely experienced insurance person with an in-
depth look at the important provisions common to ne arly all types of professional liability (PL) and 
management liability (ML) insurance policy forms. The four major types of provisions this course 
analyzes are: (1) insuring agreements; (2) limits, deductibles/retentions, and coinsurance; (3) 
conditions, and (4) exclusions. Th e course concludes with a section addressing coverage coordination 
issues, whereby professional and management liability  policies must be coordinated with each other 
and with other types of insurance coverage. 
Insurance textbooks and reference manuals frequen tly contain separate discussions of a policy’s 
“definitions” section. Although virtually all PL and ML policy forms contain a “definitions” section, 
please note that this course will not have a separate section addressing them. This is because the 
insuring agreements, limits, deductibles/retentions, coinsurance, conditions, and exclusions sections 
of PL and ML policies contain numerous defined term s. Such terms will be analyzed in these sections 
of this course. Following a course introduction and overview in Chapter 1, the course is arranged as follows: 
• Chapter 2: Insuring Agreements. This chapter examines in detail the sections of an 
insurance policy that explain the circumstan ces under which the insurer promises to make 
payment to or on behalf of the insured. Mo re specifically, it analyzes provisions covering 
professional services/acts, persons and organizations , the territory in which the policy applies, 
and the provisions enumerating the kinds of da mages policies cover. This chapter concludes 
with a discussion of how defense costs and de fense procedures are addressed by the forms. 
• Chapter 3: Limits, Deductibles/Retentions, Coinsurance.  This chapter analyzes the key 
elements of the limits, deductibles/retenti ons, and coinsurance provisions found within 
professional and management liability policies. The chapter explains how they work in 
conjunction with other types of policy provisions  to both restrict and, in a few instances, 
expand the scope of coverage provided by the forms.   
• Chapter 4: Conditions.  The conditions sections in prof essional and management liability 
policy forms state the respective rights and the requirements applicable to both the insured 
and insurer under the policy. The major policy co nditions discussed in this chapter include (1) 
notice of cancellation, nonrenewal, and premium/ coverage change; (2) subrogation; (3) other 
insurance; (4) notice of claim; and (5) miscellaneous conditions.  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
2 • Chapter 5: Exclusions.   Policy exclusions—both those included in the form itself and those 
added by endorsement—have a profound effect on the scope of coverage provided by 
professional and management liability insurance policies. This chapter discusses the four 
major types of exclusions: (1) exclusions for uninsurable exposures; (2) exclusions removable 
or modifiable by negotiation, with or wit hout additional premium; (3) exclusions for 
exposures better suited to other types of covera ge; and (4) exclusions for exposures pertaining 
to a specialized type of work within a given profession.   
• Chapter 6: Coverage Coordination. This section addresses the issue of professional and management liability coverage coordination. More specifically, it explains how to (1) 
coordinate professional and mana gement liability policies with  commercial general liability 
(CGL) policies and (2) coordinate professional and management liability policies with each 
other, to eliminate coverage gaps and overlaps between the policies.  
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. List and describe the insuring agreements found in professional and management liability insurance policies.  
2. Explain how these insuring agreements apply to actual claim situations and offer examples of 
how they can be modified to expand the scope of coverage the policies can provide for an 
insured. 
3. State the types of losses that are covered or excluded by professional and management 
liability policy forms and state the rationales for coverage or exclusion, especially as respects 
punitive damages.  
4. Apply the defense cost coverage and defen se procedure provisions to real-world claim 
scenarios.  
5. Analyze the ways in which the different types of limits, deductibles/retentions, and 
coinsurance provisions apply to various prof essional and management liability policies and 
understand how they restrict, but in some cases,  expand the scope of coverage under a given 
policy. 
6.  Identify the important policy conditions found  within professional and management liability 
policy forms and discuss the ways in which they affect the respective rights and responsibilities of both the insurer and the insured.  
7. List and classify the major exclusions found within professional and management liability policies into one the four major groups of exclusions. 
8. Describe the major exclusions, analyze the rationale underlying each, and state the ways in 
which they can be modified to expand the scope of coverage available for an insured under professional and management liability policies. 
9. Explain the importance of coordinating pr ofessional/management liability coverage in 
preventing coverage gaps and overlaps and provide examples of how PL/EL policies can be 
coordinated with (1) each other and (2) with  other types of insurance policies such as 
commercial general liability (CGL) insurance.  
  
  
3 Chapter 2 
Insuring Agreements 
The insuring agreements common to PL and ML policies include: covere d services/covered acts, 
covered persons, covered or ganizations, covered territory, covere d damages, defense procedures, and 
defense cost provisions. Insuring agreements are those sections of an insurance policy in which the 
insurer explains the circumstances under which, as well as the terms and conditions under which, it 
promises to make payment to or on behalf of the insured. 
Covered Services/Covered Acts 
Professional liability insurance policies specify the scope of “covered services” (or “covered acts”), in one of three places:  
1. the policy’s “covered services” definition,  
2. the policy’s declarations page, or 
3. the application form.  
Since the information contained in application form s is automatically incorporated within PL and ML 
policies, the scope of covered services indicated by applications also delineates the kinds of services and activities the policy will cover.   
Check the Scope of “Covered Services” To Assure Coverage 
It does not matter which of the three approaches not ed above is used to indicate the scope of the 
insured’s services that will be covered by a policy. However, it is important to verify that the 
description provided by any of these methods matches the correct and complete scope of work actually engaged in by the insured and is consistent  with acts that are a generally accepted part of a 
given profession.  
The Policy’s Definition of “Covered Serv ices” Should Match the Insured’s Services 
Where the definitions section of the policy is used to  specify the services offere d by an insured, this 
definition should be checked to verify that it do es, in fact, match the types of professional services 
actually provided by the insured. If this is not the case, appropriately worded manuscript 
endorsements should be attached to the policy to expand the definition of covered professional 
services. (Manuscript endorsements are customized  endorsements, applying to individual insurance 
policies, as opposed to standard, preprinted endorsemen ts that can be attached to many policies. In 
effect, a manuscript endorsement is a “one-of-a-kind” modification to a single policy.)  
  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
4 A few additional points regarding policy definitions of “covered services” should be considered, as 
follows. 
• Services not enumerated but covered beca use they are common to the profession.  
Insurance agents routinely handle small (i.e., less than $1,000) homeowners claims, rather 
than having an insurance company adjuster settle them. Accordingly, these agents have the authority to issue claim payments to an insured. As a result, “claims handling services” need not be specifically enumerated as a covered professional service by an insurance agent’s E&O policy’s definition of “covered services,” ot her than having the policy cover “insurance 
brokerage services.”  
• Services not enumerated and uncommon to the profession; covered only by 
endorsement.  Conversely, few insurance agents also  provide actuarial consulting services on 
a fee basis. Thus, an insurance agent who desires professional liability coverage for such activities should be certain that “actuarial consulting” is specifically included within the policy’s definition of covered services. (Normally, coverage for actuarial work is not within 
the definition of covered professional services under agents E&O policies. Accordingly, a manuscript endorsement that adds “actuari al services” to the “professional services” 
definition must usually be added by endorsement.)  
Declarations Pages Should Contain Broad “Covered Services” Descriptions 
Particular care should be taken with policies requi ring a simple definition of the insured’s profession 
to be entered on the declarations page. While such descriptions are usually very brief (e.g., 
“mechanical engineering”), they are nevertheless significant. For example, suppose the phrase “mechanical engineering” is entered on the declara tions page of an engin eer’s professional liability 
policy. If the insured firm were to sublet to anot her engineering firm a portion of a project involving 
electrical engineering work, an insurer could assert that coverage under the policy does not extend to 
a claim involving such work because “electrical engin eering” was not noted in the declarations page 
description as an insured professional service. Thus, in this case, the declarations page professional 
services description should state “engineering services, including, but not limited to mechanical and 
electrical engineering.” 
As another example, assume that an ophthalmologist  specializes in retinal surgery. If the “covered 
services” description in the declarations page of the ophthalmologist’s PL policy reads 
“ophthalmology,” an insurer could possibly deny coverage for a claim on the b asis that retinal surgery 
is a more risky sub-specialty of ophthalmology. In  this situation, the covered services line on the 
declarations page should read “ ophthalmology, including but not limited to retinal surgery.”  
As indicated in these examples, the professional ser vices description on the declarations page should 
be as broad as reasonably possible. 
Application Forms Should Contain Details of All Professional Services Offered 
The application for professional lia bility coverage typically describes in detail the scope of the 
insured’s professional activities. To assure that all t ypes of work engaged in by the insured will be 
covered by the policy, portions of the applica tion that require a description of services provided 
should be reviewed carefully. On most applications , insureds are asked to list the subcategories of 
services they provide. After each such category, eith er the total annual revenue generated from those 
services or the percentage of the insured’s annual revenue derived from such services must also be indicated. Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
5 Under the provisions of virtua lly all professional liability insu rance policies, applications 
automatically become part of, or are incorporated in to, that policy. By incorporation, statements made 
in the application become warranties and, thus, conditions of the insurer’s obligations under the 
policy. For this reason, if the complete scope of an insured’s activities is listed on the application in 
the manner described above, it will be difficult for an insurer to deny coverage for a claim associated 
with any type of work that is enumerated in the application.  
Advise the Underwriter of Changes in  Professional Services Provided 
It should also be mentioned that if, during the term of coverage, an insured begins to offer 
professional services that are somewhat different fro m those described within the policy’s “covered 
services” definition, the policy’s declarations page, or the application, it is prudent to advise the 
underwriter. This action provides yet another safegua rd against a potential coverage denial in the 
event that the insurer did not intend to cover su ch activities, even if it means that the underwriter 
requests additional premium. To illustrate: an accounting firm that previously provided only tax preparation services decides to begin performing a udits. Under these circumstances, the firm should 
notify its PL insurer because audit work generat es higher claim frequency and severity than tax 
preparation services and for this reason, the insurer will appropriately require additional premium. 
Coverage for High-Hazard Activities 
Within many professions there are a number of specialty areas that generate higher-than-average claim frequency. For example, accountants involve d in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
work, physicians who perform bariatric surgery, and engineers who do soil testing have a tendency to 
produce a much higher frequency and severity of claims than do comparable professionals who do not 
engage in these specialty areas. Accordingly, a number of professional liability policies routinely 
exclude coverage (either within the policy form or by standard exclusionary endorsements) for claims 
arising from certain specified high-risk professional activities. If an insured’s practice involves such 
work, either the underwriter should be requested to remove the applicable exclusion (for which 
additional premium will be charged), or the insu red should secure coverage under a special policy 
(normally written in the excess and surplus lines insu rance market), that is designed to cover 
professionals who practice in these high-hazard sp ecialty areas which are frequently excluded by 
standard forms. 
Covered Persons 
Under most PL policies, both the professional firm an d the individuals affiliated with the firm, while 
acting within the scope of their employment, are also insureds. Depending upon the individual policy, 
the following are normally designated as “covered persons” under the policy.  
• Directors  
• Officers 
• Managers  
• Supervisors  
• Employees  
• Partners 
• Principals  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
6 • Stockholders  
• Owners 
• Volunteers 
• Interns  
Note that the exact scope of such “covered persons” varies slightly from policy-to-policy. 
Coverage of Past Personnel 
Nearly all PL policies also include provisions affo rding coverage to persons  no longer affiliated with 
the insured firm, provided the act which is the subj ect of the claim against them was committed while 
they were associated with the insured organization.  
For example, assume that during 2006, an account ant employed by ABC Accounting performed an 
audit of the XYZ Company. On January 1, 2007, the accountant left ABC. On January 1, 2008, XYZ 
Company brings a claim against the accountant.  Under these circumstances, ABC’s professional 
liability policy will cover the accountant despite the f act that she is no longer an employee of ABC at 
the time the claim was made. This is because the a lleged wrongful act giving rise to the claim was 
committed during 2006 while she was an employee of ABC. As this scenario illustrates, coverage 
applies to past personnel under professional liability forms—even if the individual against whom the 
claim is brought is no longer associated with the insured firm—as long as that person committed the 
alleged wrongful act while working on be half of the insured organization. 
Why Cover Past Personnel? 
It is usually favorable to provide coverage for cl aims that may arise involving individuals, even after 
they are no longer working for the insured professiona l firm. This helps to assure that they will 
cooperate in a claim made jointly against them and the insured firm. Assume, for example, a claim is made against a law firm and that a former partner (“FP”) is also named in the lawsuit. FP’s incentive 
to cooperate with the firm is greatly reduced if no coverage is afforded for FP. This, in fact, could 
lead FP to cooperate with the plaintiff in retu rn for dropping the claim against FP. Bottom line: 
coverage of persons who are no longer with a professional firm at the time a claim is made 
encourages such individuals to cooperate with the insured firm in the event a claim is brought against 
both the insured firm and the former employee. 
The Professional Liability Exposure of Former Personnel 
One significant implication of a policy that provid es coverage for past personnel is that once a person 
leaves a professional firm, there is little need fo r that person to buy separate coverage for acts 
committed while associated with that organization.  
There could, however, be potential problems for the former employee/partner if the organization fails 
to continuously purchase professional liability insurance or  carries an inadequate limit. Consider this 
scenario: 3 years after a lawyer leaves a law firm, a claim is made against him for acts that took place 
while he was employed by a law firm. The lawyer would have coverage for the claim under the firm’s 
current policy, but only if it has continued to renew coverage and actually does have a policy in effect 
at the time the claim is made.  This s ituation is illustrated in Exhibit 2.1. 
 
  Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
7 Exhibit 2.1 
Coverage of Former Personnel 
 
 
In this example, coverage for the former partner ’s wrongful act will be available under the firm’s 
1/1/12–13 policy. This is true even if the insurer during the 1/1/12–13 term is not the same as the 
one that wrote the policy when the wrongful act was committed (i.e., during the 1/1/10–11term), 
provided the retroactive date under the 1/1/12–13 policy is earlier in time than the date on which 
the wrongful act was committed.  
 
However, even assuming the firm did renew coverage  and had a policy in place at the time a claim is 
made against the former employee, there are thr ee additional, potential coverage gaps facing the 
attorney in this situation: 
• The policy limit available may be inadequate to cover the claim;  
• The limit may already have been exhausted by other claims against the firm, or 
• Coverage for the particular type of claim made  against the attorney ma y be excluded by the 
policy.   
For these reasons, professionals should keep abr east of the coverage purchased by professional 
organizations with which they were previously affiliated. If they feel they may be exposed to claims 
as a result of such service, they should consider a rranging coverage of their own. This is especially 
true if they have doubts about whether their prior firm is continuing to buy PL coverage. 
Nevertheless, it should be recognized  that it is difficult and costly to buy coverage under such 
circumstances. 
Coverage for Prior Acts 
Another coverage issue that individual insureds  must consider under professional liability policy 
forms is the extent of coverage they are afford ed for acts committed before joining the insured 
professional organization. Such persons have no coverage under the policy written for their current 
firm for acts committed while working for a previous  firm, even if claims are made against them 
during the current policy period of their present em ployer. This is because, as a general rule, 
professional liability coverage follows the organization rather than the individual. However, such 
persons will be provided c overage by the previous firm for acti ons taken on the firm’s behalf, based 
on the principles discussed above in “The Professional Liability Exposure of Former Personnel.”  
Under special circumstances, an underwriter may be willing to afford prior acts coverage for an 
individual who joins a prof essional firm. However, this would typically require the person to submit a 
separate application so the insurer could properly eval uate the exposure to claims prior to joining the 
firm. Such coverage should only be requested in ve ry special situations, esp ecially since claims from 
prior acts potentially dilute the limits available to the firm that the professional has just joined.  
Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
8 The Lack of Coverage for Outside Activities 
It should also be noted that under nearly all types of professional liability policies, insured status only 
applies while acting within the scope of employment  for the named insured. Because professionals of 
all kinds sometimes undertake work in their spare time or moonlight with other organizations, it 
should be made clear to them that no coverage will be provided for outside activities under the named 
insured’s professional liability policy.  
Therefore, if an employee or a partner of a professi onal firm begins doing work that is not associated 
with the firm, such persons must either: (1) make sure they are covered under the other organization’s 
policy (i.e., the organization for which he or sh e is “moonlighting” or (2) arrange separate PL 
coverage of their own. Note: some PL policy forms preclude coverage for work done while not on 
behalf of the named insured employer, by means of an exclusion, rather than via the policy’s 
“covered acts” provision. This exclusion will be addressed later in this course. 
Liability Coverage for Independent Contractor Acts 
The majority of professional liability policy form s cover the named insured’s liability for services 
performed by independent contractors working “on behalf of the named insured” or for the errors and 
omissions of others “for which the named insured is legally responsible.” For instance, law firms 
sometimes consult with other law firms or lawyer s (in what are known as “of counsel” relationships) 
when specialized expertise is required on a give n case. Such coverage extensions could become 
important if, for example, the outside firm commits  an error or omission and the insured is also 
named in a lawsuit.  
If a claim is made against a professional or professi onal firm in conjunction with the independent 
contractors’ work, the contractor’s own coverage will normally respond to such a claim. A possible 
scenario: law firm A contracts with law firm B to do specialized research on a particular case. If law 
firm A is sued based upon law firm B’s negligent work, B’s professional liability policy should respond to the claim and defend or indemnify law firm A. However, there may be times when 
independent contractors such as law firm B are uninsured or underinsured. Therefore, as a “back-up,” nearly all professional liability polic ies also cover an insured’s liabi lity for the acts of independent 
contractors, such as law firm B in this example.  
Spousal Coverage 
Insured professionals sometimes attempt to shield their assets from potential claim judgments by transferring those assets to their spouses. To counter this tactic, plaintiffs’ attorneys also name the 
insured professionals’ spouses in suit papers. Ther efore, spouses require protection under professional 
liability forms, and many insurers have responded to  this need by extending insured status to the 
spouses of insured professionals. 
At one time, such coverage was available only by  endorsement, although currently many professional 
liability insurers automatically afford spousal coverage within their regular policy form.  
Spousal Coverage Definition That Includes Domestic Partners 
A few insurers’ forms contain a spousal coverage definition that covers “spouses, including ‘domestic 
partners’...” Given the increasing incidence of such  living arrangements, the need to provide this 
coverage extension will grow. Pr eferred wording, which provides the broadest possible scope of 
coverage, defines a domestic partner as a person qualifying as such “under the applicable federal, Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
9 state, or local law or under the provisions of any benefit program established by the corporate 
organization.” 
No Coverage for a Spouse’s Wrongful Act 
It should be recognized, however, that spousal cove rage does not extend protection to a spouse of an 
insured if the spouse commits an alleged wrongful act. Rather, such provisions only cover a spouse’s 
liability because the spouse shares inte rest in the property of an insured professional. In effect, 
coverage of a spouse applies only as a consequence of  the spouse’s status, rather than for the spouse’s 
acts. Case-in-point: under employment practices liability policies, all employees are insureds. If a claim were made against an employee, coverage would also extend to the employee’s spouse, but 
only as to the spouse’s interest in assets held jointl y (to which, as noted above, claimants’ attorneys 
frequently seek access). In contrast, the employee’s s pouse would not have coverage if, for example, 
the spouse was accused of committing sexual harassme nt at the insured company’s Christmas party. 
Coverage of Personal Represe ntatives: Heirs, Executors, Trustees, and Legal 
Representatives 
Nearly all professional liability policies also include heirs, executors, trustees in bankruptcy, and legal 
representatives (of insureds) as insureds. The necessity of this feature can be appreciated when one considers that the liability of professionals is a fo rm of personal liability. The coverage afforded 
under such policy provisions is protection against claims on their personal assets. If persons insured under the policy die, are declared incompetent, or f ile for bankruptcy, such protection is transferred to 
their heirs, estates, or trustees.  
Covered Organizations 
The covered professional firm or individual (if a sole practitioner), is designated as the “insured 
organization” under most professional liability policies. 
Coverage for Predecessor Organizations 
Many, but not all professional liability insurance policies provide coverage for what are known as 
“predecessor organizations.” Such coverage would be important under circumstances similar to those 
in the following example. Assume that two account ants—“A” and “B”—form a partnership. After 5 
years, they merge their practice with an existing partnership consisting of accountants “C,” “D,” and 
“E.” Also assume this new combination purchases a professional liability policy. Under many policy 
forms, coverage would be available for errors  and omissions committed during the “A and B” 
partnership—even if claims arising from those acts are not made against the new firm until after the 
aforementioned merger of the two firms. 
PL policies use one of two approaches to provide predecessor organization coverage: (1) defining the 
term “predecessor firm” and includ ing predecessor firms within the policy’s definition of “insured 
organization” or (2) listing specific predecessor firms as insureds on the policy’s declarations page.  
Defining Predecessor Firms as “Insured Organizations”  
Under this approach, “predecessor firm” is define d as “a corporation or partnership to whose assets 
and liabilities the named insured is th e majority successor in interest.” The key word in this definition 
is “majority.” More specifically, unless the currently insured firm took over more than 50 percent of the former firm’s assets and liabilities, there would be no coverage for the acts of the acquiree that 
took place prior to the acquisition. Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
10 In more concrete terms, assets and liabilities generally refer to active clie nt files or to current projects. 
For example, in the merger of A and B with C, D, and E in the previous example, C, D, and E would 
be a majority successor in interest if it took over 50.1 percent of A and B’s active files as part of the 
merger agreement. Thus, for a predecessor firm to be an insured under a PL policy, the professional firm that acquired it must have acquired a majority of its assets. 
Listing Predecessor Firms as Insureds on the Declarations Page 
This approach simply lists the predecessor firm(s) for which coverage is sought on the declarations 
page of the policy, without actually having to define the term “predecessor firm,” and would be useful in a situation where the insured organization did no t take over a majority of the predecessor firm’s 
assets and would therefore not be considered a predecessor firm under most PL policies’ definition of 
the term. For example, assume in the merger of A a nd B with C, D, and E, that the latter firm did not 
take over a majority or A&B’s client files. Yet the partners and employees of A and B will still need 
coverage for acts committed prior to the me rger, and this approach will provide it. 
Predecessor Firm Coverage is Not Automatic 
As already mentioned, not all PL policy forms automatically cover predecessor organizations. 
However, underwriters will usually agree to provide  such coverage by naming the predecessor firm as 
an insured on the current policy. Typically, this  requires payment of additional premium. Most 
insurers are not averse to covering exposures of this kind, provided they are given sufficient 
underwriting data with which to evaluate and price such risks. 
Coverage for Joint Ventures   
Most of the policies also include “joint ventures” w ithin their definitions of “insured organizations.” 
However, there is one key caveat associated with  joint venture coverage: only named joint ventures 
are covered. In effect, unless the underwriter is on notice as to the existence of a joint venture 
(normally by means of the application form or by being notified by the insured during the policy period), no coverage applies. This is logical  from an underwriting standpoint because the insurer 
should be in a position to evaluate a joint venture fo r which coverage is sought and either (a) provide 
such coverage (usually subject to additional prem ium reflecting the additional exposure) or to (b) 
determine that it does not wish to cover the joint venture at any premium.   
Coverage for Newly Acquired/Formed Entities 
Most, but not all, professional liability policies pr ovide “automatic” coverage for newly acquired and 
newly formed entities in which the insured owns a majority interest (i.e., more than 50 percent).  
Automatic Coverage 
Automatic coverage means that c overage is immediately applicable for the newly created or newly 
acquired entity, with no other restrictions—even be fore the insurer’s underwriter receives information 
about the new entity. The period of time during which automatic coverage applies, before the 
underwriter must receive notification, varies from 30 to 90 days, with 60 days being most common. 
(For the insured, the longer the period during which automatic coverage applies,  the better.) After this 
period of automatic coverage, the insurer requires submission of information about the new company, 
as well as additional premium, if  coverage is to continue.  Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
11 Automatic Coverage Subject to Limits on the Size of the New Entity 
In contrast to the policies that grant automatic coverage of newly acquired/created entities without 
qualification, some policies  grant such coverage only if the new entity does not exceed a certain size 
relative to the existing entity. For example, if  a newly acquired entity’s assets do not exceed 15 
percent of the acquiree’s assets, an insurer w ould provide automatic coverage. Generally, this 
threshold of assets for which automatic coverage  applies ranges from 10 percent to 25 percent; the 
higher the percentage, the more favorable for the insured.  
Nonautomatic Coverage 
In contrast, a few PL and ML insurers’ policies do not grant automatic coverage. Instead, they 
indicate that in the event of a merger or acquisiti on, the insurer reserves the right to renegotiate the 
policy’s premium, or even refuse to cover the new entity. Nor do such policies provide any temporary 
coverage, prior to requiring additional pr emium for the continuation of coverage. 
Covered Territory 
There are two types of territorial provisions used  in professional liability policies. The first type 
provides (1) unrestricted worldwide coverage. The second, and most common type affords coverage 
for (2) wrongful acts taking place anywhere in the world,  but only if the claim or  suit is brought in the 
United States, its territories, possessions, or Canada.  
Rationale for Territorial Restrictions 
One  rationale for territorial restrictions in professional liability policies is that insurers are sometimes 
reluctant to provide coverage for claims based upon laws of countries outside the United States. 
Another rationale for not covering claims brought outsi de of the United States is that such claims are 
more difficult for the insurer to control and manage. Given the problems of location and distance, it is 
often harder to provide the personnel to oversee a nd adequately defend such claims, especially for 
small, regional insurers. Yet another rationale for territorial restrictions  is that some insurers may not 
be legally permitted to operate in certain foreign countries due to licensing restrictions. 
Despite such restrictions, insurers are usually w illing to amend policies to provide broader coverage, 
e.g., coverage for claims brought in additional, sp ecific locations or coverage for claims brought 
anywhere in the world. Such extensions are especially important for professional organizations 
having operations or exposures in non-U.S. locations as well as when they have any kind of electronic 
exposures to professional liability (e.g., a hospital that subcontracts the reading of radiological scans 
to firms in India; an insurer that subcontracts data entry operations to a company in Ireland).  
Covered Damages/Covered Losses 
PL and ML policies cover damages/losses for which th e insured is legally liable when such damages 
result from the delivery of professional services. Covered damages/losses are generally of two kinds: 
(1) the costs to investigate and defend a claim made  against insureds, and (2) amounts that result from 
either a judgment in a court of law or a settle ment between the insurer and the claimant. (The 
damages paid in a judgment or settlement are known as “indemnity payments.”)  
Key areas pertaining to covered damages/covered losses under PL and ML policies include coverage 
of punitive damages, coverage for return of prof essional fees, and coverage for “other” items.  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
12 Coverage of Punitive Damages 
Punitive damages, which are frequently  awarded  against professionals, are intended to punish a 
defendant (rather than compensate a plaintiff/claima nt for a specific loss) and are awarded to “send a 
message” that the defendant’s conduct in causing the claim was unusually objectionable, with the 
intention of deterring such actions by this pa rticular professional (and others) in the future. 
Coverage of Punitive Damages Varies by Line of Coverage 
Although it is difficult to generalize, currently, about two-thirds of all professional liability policies either affirmatively cover punitive damages (by stati ng that coverage is available where  payment of 
punitive damages under an insurance policy are not ba rred by applicable statute or by common law) 
or contain no exclusion for punitive damages.  
Whether or not a policy covers/excludes punitive damages is most often a function of the type of 
professional liability policy in question. For example, while nearly all employment practices liability insurance policies cover punitive damages, the majo rity of miscellaneous professional liability policy 
forms exclude punitive damages.  
Exclusion of coverage for punitive damages is ac complished in one of two ways (1) by means of 
“covered damages” or “covered loss” definitions st ating that punitive damages do not fall within 
these definitions, or (2) by means of a punitive damages exclusion.  
Coverage of Punitive Damages  Varies by Jurisdiction 
Despite the fact that the majority of PL and ML  policies either affirmatively cover punitive damages 
or do not specifically exclude them, it is important to understand that a significant minority of states, 
including California, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Illinois, bar or restrict the extent to which 
punitive damages may be paid  by an insurance po licy. As a result, even though a PL or ML policy 
covers them, state law in a number of jurisdictions  prevents an insurer from paying punitive damages 
under a policy. 
Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions 
In recent years, professional liability insurers (most often, those writing directors and officers liability 
and employment practices liability policies), have a ttempted to circumvent state-specific prohibitions 
against insurer payment of punitive damages, by means of what are known as “most favorable 
jurisdiction” provisions. Such wording states that, with respect to determining the insurability of 
punitive damages, the law of the jurisdiction most favorable to the insurability of punitive damages 
will apply, provided the jurisdiction meets one of the following 4 criteria; the jurisdiction where: (1)  the act giving rise to the punitive damages award occurred, (2) the claim giving rise to the punitive 
damages is made, (3) the insured is incorporated or  maintains its principal place of business, or (4) the 
insurer is incorporated or maintains its princi pal place of business. A most favorable jurisdiction 
provision would be important in th e following scenario. Assume that an  insured is incorporated in a 
jurisdiction that bars insurance payment of pun itive damages and that a punitive damages award is 
made against the insured in this jurisdiction. However, the insured has a PL policy written with a 
most favorable jurisdiction provision and the in surer is incorporated in a state where punitive 
damages coverage is permitted. As a result, the in surer will indemnify the insured for payment of the 
punitive damages award, regardless of the fact th at the insured is incorporated in and punitive 
damages were awarded in a jurisdiction that bars such payment.  Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
13 When Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions are Critical 
Most favorable jurisdiction wording is important if  a claim is brought in a state where payment  of 
punitive damages is prohibited by law despite the fact that the a pplicable professional liability policy 
provides such coverage. Under these circumstances,  in the absence of most favorable jurisdiction 
wording, punitive damages coverage  may not be available, even if the claim were made under a 
policy that affirmatively covered punitive damag es. Most favorable venue wording is therefore 
imperative (a) when purchasing a PL or ML polic y in a state where punitive damages are not 
insurable and (b) for insured professionals who ha ve multistate operations and who therefore cannot 
predict where the claims seeki ng punitive damages will arise.  
Two Limitations of Most Favor able Jurisdiction Provisions 
Despite the additional coverage provided by most fa vorable jurisdiction provisions, they contain two 
key limitations. First, most favorable jurisdicti on wording merely modifies the existing level of 
coverage for punitive damages already provided by  a professional liability policy; it does not provide 
coverage if punitive damages are excluded by the policy. (Although, if a professional liability policy 
is written with punitive damages coverage, an e ndorsement providing most favorable jurisdiction 
wording should, of course, be requested.) Second,  the enforceability of most favorable jurisdiction 
wording has never been tested in court. As a result,  insureds are advised to request such wording, but 
should not be required to pay additional premium fo r it, because its legal enforceability has not yet 
been proven and therefore an insurer’s liability for payment as a result of this endorsement remains 
uncertain. 
Return of Professional Fees Are Not “Covered Damages” 
PL policies do not cover claims involving the return of fees or recoupment of charges that have been 
paid to a professional. For example, assume an ar chitect designs a defective building that collapses 
and injures several pedestrians. Also assume that the owner of the building who hired the architect 
sues the architect, demanding a return of the $100, 000 fee that the owner paid the architect. An 
architects and engineers PL policy would not provide coverage to the insured architect for returning 
the fee, despite the fact that the architect may still be legally liable to the owner for doing so.  
Rationale for Not Covering the Return of Professional Fees 
The rationale for not covering the return of professi onal fees is that this exposure is a business risk 
which should not be the subject of professional liability insurance coverage. In effect, the policy intends to cover unforeseeable damages resulting fro m a professional’s negligent acts (e.g., bodily 
injury, property damage, financial loss, personal inju ry), but not the cost of the services charged by a 
professional who performs negligently. Accordingly, in the above example, the architect’s professional liability policy would cove r the cost of paying another architect to perform “remedial” 
services to correct the insured archit ect’s error, when the defective building is repaired, but would not 
indemnify the architect if he were required to re turn his original $100,000 paid to the owner. 
Other Items That Are Not “Covered Damages” 
In addition, the following items generally do not fall within the typical PL policy’s definition of 
“covered damages” or “loss”: (1) professional sanctio ns (e.g., suspending a professional’s license for 
a period of time), (2) fines, (3) penalties, and (4) taxes.  
The first three items are not covered since they are generally imposed upon a professional whose 
conduct is not merely negligent. Rather, they ar e assessed when the prof essional’s conduct has been Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
14 either grossly negligent (e.g., a doctor performs an  operation while intoxicated) or willful (e.g., a 
dentist actually tries to injure a patient). To cove r such items would be contrary to public policy. 
“Public policy” refers to rules or laws that either guide or encourage certain actions, rather than 
compel such actions. Taxes owed are not covered since they are considered a cost of doing business 
and therefore are not the subject of professional liability insurance coverage.  
Covered Defense Costs  
As noted previously, all professional liability insurance policies afford coverage for the costs 
involved in investigating, defending, and settling claims. These covered items encompass attorneys’ 
fees, court costs, bonds, and related expenses invol ved in the loss settlement process.  The key areas 
pertaining to defense cost coverage include: 
• the fact that defense costs are covered wi thin (and not in addition to) policy limits,  
• the fact that the insurer’s internal claim hand ling costs are not charged against policy limits,   
• the rationale for and implications of PL and ML policy defense cost provisions,  
• the application of deductibles\re tentions to defense costs, and 
• the manner in which supplementary payments coverage applies to PL policies. 
Defense Costs are Covered Within—N ot In Addition to Policy Limits 
Under the vast majority of PL policies, defense cost s are covered within, rather than in addition to, 
policy limits. This means that if monies are expended to defend an insured, this reduces available 
policy limits. In other words, under PL policies, not  only indemnity payments (i.e., settlements and 
judgments), but also the expenditure of defense costs, reduce policy limits. This is significant since 
under some types of coverage, notably D&O insuran ce, defense costs routinely exceed the indemnity 
payments for an individual claim. 
The approach to covering defense costs under PL/EL polic y forms is in direct contrast to that used in 
commercial general liability (CGL) policies, whereby defense costs are covered in addition to policy 
limits. When coverage is written in addition to polic y limits, the expenditure of defense costs does not 
reduce the policy’s limit of coverage, so that in th eory, an unlimited amount of money could be spent 
under a CGL policy to defend an insured, without reducing the amount of money available to pay 
indemnity costs. 
 
  Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
15 Exhibit 2.2 
Defense Cost Coverage Case Study 
A  PL Policy in Which Defense is Covered “Within” Policy Limits  
Policy Limit : $1 million 
Once defense costs and indemnity payments (i n any combination) have reached $1 million, no 
additional monies are available under the policy for either indemnity payments or defense costs. 
In fact, defense costs alone  could exhaust the policy limit. 
 
A CGL Policy in Which Defense is Covered “In Addition To” Policy Limits  
Policy Limit : $1 million 
Regardless of how much money has been expended to defend a claim (or claims) against an 
insured, the full $1 million policy limit remains available to cover (1) $1 million of indemnity payments, plus (2) an unlimited amount of additional def ense costs until the policy’s limit is 
exhausted by indemnity payments. 
Insurers’ Internal Claim Handling Costs Are Not Subject to Policy Limits 
Insurers’ internal costs of defending claims, such as the salaries of attorney s and adjusters employed 
by the insurer, do not constitute defense costs acco rding to PL policy definitions of “defense costs.” 
These items are not charged against an insured’s policy limits—as are the cost of services rendered by 
an independent attorney or by an independent adju sting firm—and therefore do not reduce the limit of 
coverage available (under a policy wh ere defense is “within limits”).  
Rationale for Defense Cost Provisions 
Until the early 1980s, it was actually more common for professional liability insurance policies to 
cover defense in addition to, rather than within, po licy limits. However, since that time, the costs of 
defending claims against professionals have increas ed substantially. Accordingly, insurers are 
generally unwilling to provide coverage in addition to policy limits. This rapid growth in defense 
expenditures has made it difficult for insurers to project such costs, which adds to the already 
complicated task of developing accurate premium rates for professional liability coverage lines. In view of such problems, reinsurers are also reluct ant to participate when policies cover defense in 
addition to policy limits. The end result is that few major lines of professional liability (insurance 
agents, media liability, and medical professional lia bility policies being the exceptions) cover defense 
in addition to limits. 
Implications of Defense Cost Provisions 
Of course, under the relatively small percentage of PL policies in which coverage of defense is in 
addition to policy limits, it is a significant benefit for insureds, considering that defense costs, 
especially in certain professional liability lines, ar e enormous. For example, participants in the 2006 
Towers Perrin Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability Survey revealed that the average cost of defending a shareholder securities claim in 2006 was $2,798,404, up from $2,140,343 in 2005!  
Premium Implications 
When comparing policy forms, those covering defe nse in addition to a policy’s limits provide a 
significant advantage relative to those in which paym ent of defense is within the limit of coverage. 
Nevertheless, this advantage might be reflected in the price of the policy, so that a policy premium Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
16 covering defense in addition to polic y limits is usually substantially higher than for a comparable one 
in which defense costs are within policy limits. 
Policy Limit Implications 
The manner in which insurers treat coverage of defen se costs is also an important point to consider in 
selecting policy limits. For example, assume industry statistics demonstrate that defense costs in a 
particular line of coverage are roughly equal to se ttlement amounts. It could therefore be said that a 
$500,000 policy covering defense “within limits” is  equivalent to a $250,000 policy providing 
defense “in addition to” limits. Nevertheless, su ch a conclusion would be based on averages only, 
which will vary significantly on a claim-to-claim basis. Accordingly, selecting adequate but 
affordable professional liability limits is a difficult decision. 
Insurer “Bad Faith” Implications 
Policies in which defense costs are within coverage  limits also pose potential “bad faith” problems for 
insurers. (Bad faith is blatantly unfair conduc t by an insurance comp any that exceeds mere 
negligence. For example, an insurer might be accused  of committing bad faith if, for example, an auto 
liability insurer refuses to settle a claim within polic y limits, where both the insured’s liability and the 
insurer’s obligation to cover the claim under the policy, are undisputed.) Another bad faith claim 
scenario, this one involving policy limits: assume that  a claim alleging damages of $400,000 is made 
against a physician who has a prof essional liability policy with a $500,000 limit. Also assume that the 
insurer had already expended $250,000 to defend the doctor but had not at all times kept the doctor 
advised concerning these expenditures and settleme nt discussions. Under these circumstances, the 
doctor possibly has a valid bad faith claim agains t the insurer. This is because the claim could 
originally have been settled within the doctor’s policy limits. But at this point in the process,  it would 
be nearly impossible to settle the claim within policy limits since payment of the $400,000 demand, 
added to the $250,000 that had already been expended in defending the claim, would exceed the $500,000 policy limit.  
Application of Deductibles/Re tentions to Defense Costs 
Most professional liability deductible/retention clauses st ate that the deductible/retention is applied to 
both loss payments and claims expenses, regardless of whether a settlement is made on the insured’s 
behalf or a jury renders a verdict against the insured. To illustrate, assume an insurer expended 
$30,000 to defend an insured but was never required to  pay a judgment or settlement on the insured’s 
behalf because the claim was dismissed on a summary  judgment basis (i.e., a judge ruled that the case 
had so little merit that it did not even warrant a jury trial). If the policy contained a $10,000 
deductible, the insurer would seek reimbursement from the insured in this amount to satisfy the policy’s deductible provision. Clauses stating that deductibles/retentions a pply to both defense and 
indemnity payments are favorable for insurers because  they help to reduce the extent of an insurer’s 
actual payout for a given claim.  
“First-Dollar” Defense Costs Coverage 
In contrast to this approach, some insurers are w illing to provide what is known as first-dollar defense 
coverage, often, although not always , in return for an additional premium. In some instances, such 
coverage is afforded by means of an endorsement to the policy. When coverage is written on this 
basis, the deductible applies only to indemnity paymen ts and not to defense costs. Therefore, in the 
foregoing example, if defense coverage were provided on a “first dollar” basis, the insured would not be required to reimburse the insurer for the deductible  since no indemnity payments were involved.   Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
17 Another example: in a situation where defense costs and indemnity payments were $50,000 and 
$25,000, respectively, the policy deductible would apply only to the latter amount.  
Although more often provided by endorsement, first- dollar defense coverage is also automatically 
included within the terms of some professional liability insurance policies. Such provisions are 
favorable for the insured and also provide the insurer with a meaningful marketing advantage.  
Covered Supplementary Payments 
Most professional liability policies also cover wh at are termed “supplementary payments” that 
include first aid expenses, premiums on appeal bonds and bail bonds, interest on judgments, and 
reasonable expenses incurred by the insured at the insurer’s request. The latter item typically involves 
travel expenses required for attendance at hearings and trials. Such covere d supplementary expenses 
do not, however, under most forms, include the insu red’s salary or earnings lost as a result of trial 
attendance or assistance to the insurer. 
Coverage within or in Addi tion to Policy Limits? 
The key point of differentiation as respects suppl ementary payments provisions in PL policies is 
whether they are covered within or in addition to policy limits. The majority approach is for 
supplementary payments to be covered within policy limits and therefore they reduce available 
coverage limits. However, in a few coverage lines,  most commonly in agents and brokers professional 
liability and police professional liability forms, some  insurers cover supplementary payments in 
addition to the policy’s limits, which is of  course, favorable for the insured.  
Defense Provisions  
The defense provisions within PL policies consis t of: (1) defense procedures and (2) settlement 
procedures. 
Defense Procedures: “Duty To Defe nd” versus “Non-duty To Defend” 
Language 
Professional liability insurance policies are written with one of two types of defense procedure provisions: (1) “duty to defend” provisions or (2) “non-duty to defend” provisions.  
The phrase “duty to defend” in a professional liabilit y policy expressly states th at the insurer has the 
duty to defend any claim alleging a covered act under the policy.  
In contrast, other professional and D&O liability policies state that “… we have no duty to defend the 
insured for claims made under this policy.  Rather, it is the duty of the insured to defend claims…”   
Accordingly, non-duty to defend forms only compel th e insurer to pay the defense costs in connection 
with the insured’s executing the defense of the claims (and for that reason, non-duty to defend 
policies are occasionally called “duty to pay” policies). 
Who Controls Defense and Selects Defense Counsel? 
Two of the important differences between a “duty to defend” and a “non- duty to defend” policy 
involve: (1) the right to choose defense counsel a nd (2) the right to control the process required to 
defend the claim, which includes control over the d ecision to litigate or settle a claim (and for what 
amount of money).  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
18 Under a “duty to defend” policy, unless specifically  negotiated prior to policy inception, the insurer 
has the right to choose defense counsel. In addition, the insurer typically has the right to control the 
defense of the claim (e.g., to determ ine trial and settlement strategy). 
 In contrast, under a “non-duty to defend” policy, the insured is able to use any lawyer of its choice. 
In addition, the policyholder has the right to control the process required to defend the claim. 
Claims Handling Issues 
In many instances, a “duty to defend” provision may act ually benefit an insured, despite the fact that 
the provision reduces the extent to which the insu red can exert control over the counsel selection and 
claims handling processes. This situation is especially true if the insured is inexperienced in managing 
the complexities of professional liability litigation. On the other hand, firms that are more familiar 
with the details of the professional liability claims handling process may prefer a policy containing “non-duty to defend” language. In short, the sel ection of “duty to defend”/“non-duty to defend” 
language is an organization-specific issue.  
Professional liability, employment practices liability, and directors and officers liability policies 
written for larger, more legalistically sophisticated  insured organizations are most often written on a 
“non-duty to defend” basis. In contrast, smaller in sureds who do not have the expertise  or time to 
become closely involved in the complexities of such litigation generally opt for “duty to defend” 
policies.  
In today’s professional liability market, insureds can  often choose between a “duty to defend” or a 
“non-duty to defend” form. However, “non-duty to defend” forms are much more common in 
employment practices liability and directors and offi cers liability policies than in professional liability 
policies. This is because EPL and D&O forms are ge nerally written for larger, corporate insureds who 
tend to have more experience in handling the complexities of litigation, compared to most 
professionals who are frequently sole practitioners or operate in small (i.e., less than 10 persons) 
partnerships or professional corporations. 
“All” Allegations Defense: A Key B enefit of “Duty To Defend” Forms 
Another significant benefit for insureds of “duty to defend” policies is that under these forms, the 
insurer is obligated to defend all of the allegations in a lawsuit, as long as at least one such allegation 
is covered by the policy. The following scenario under an employment practices liability policy illustrates this point. An employee with 20 years of service is terminated by her employer, a small, privately-held company. Her lawsuit against her fo rmer employer alleges that: (1) she was wrongfully 
terminated; (2) she was sexually harassed during he r exit interview; and (3) the company owed her 
unpaid overtime wages (i.e., a wage-and-hour claim). 
Although damages arising from the first two allega tions are clearly covered by standard EPL policy 
forms, the wage-and-hour claim is excluded by vi rtually all EPL policies. However, since coverage 
exists for allegations 1 and 2, an insurer, under a “duty to defend” policy, must also defend the wage-
and-hour claim, although it would not be liable fo r any potential damages. In contrast, under a “non-
duty to defend” EPL policy, the insurer would only be obligated to pay the costs of defending counts 
1 and 2, but not count 3. 
 
 Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements 
19 Settlement Procedures 
Settlement procedures are a key element of defen se provisions found within PL and ML policies. 
Disputes between insureds and insurers as to th e reasonableness of settlement amounts are often a 
difficult issue in professional liability insurance. The following areas will be discussed as they apply 
to settlement procedures.

The Difficulties of “C ompromise” Settlements 
Professionals on one hand, and insurers on the ot her, sometimes have significantly different 
perceptions about what constitutes a reasonable se ttlement amount for a given claim. Complicating 
the settlement process is the fact that professionals typically perceive an out-of-court settlement as an 
admission of guilt or wrongdoing. Thus, they often oppose compromise settlements that might 
otherwise conserve legal costs, save time, and a void adverse publicity. From the professional’s point 
of view, an outsider learning of the settlement ma y infer (incorrectly) that a compromise settlement 
was an admission of wrongdoing. (This is particularly true since the advent of the National Practitioner’s Data Bank, which provides a record of professional liability claims made against physicians.) However, from the insu rer’s perspective, the settlement might save legal costs and, most 
importantly, prevent the risk of a “runaway jury verdict,” factors that could markedly increase the 
insurer’s total payout on the claim, in addition to  creating adverse publicity for the professional. 
The Hammer Clause Settlement Procedure 
The vast majority of PL and ML policies are written with a settlement procedure known as the “hammer clause,” which applies as follows. 
• Settlement Amounts. The insurer is required to seek the insured’s consent prior to settling a 
claim for an amount proposed by the insurer and agreed to by the claimant. However, if an 
insured does not approve a settlement figure that has been offered by the insurer and agreed 
to by the claimant, and the claim is later clo sed for a larger amount, the insurer is liable only 
for the settlement amount initially agreed upon with the claimant.  
• Defense Costs.  If an insured withholds consent to a settlement recommended by the insurer, 
any additional defense costs and expenses accrue d from that point on are not covered by the 
policy.  
• Illustration.  An insurer makes an agreement with a physician’s patient to settle a claim 
against the physician for $500,000. The physi cian refuses to accept the settlement proposal. 
The claim is settled 2 years later for $750,000 and an additional $150,000 was incurred in 
defense costs during this 2-year period. Based on the hammer clause, the insurer is not liable for (and the insured must pay) the additional $250,000 in settlement costs (i.e., $750K final 
settlement – $500K initial recommendation = $250K ). Nor is the insurer liable for the 
additional $150,000 in defense costs that were incurred, following the physician’s refusal to 
settle the claim based on the insu rer’s initial recommendation.  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
20 Is the Hammer Clause Really Unfair to the Insured? 
It could be argued that from the insured’s perspec tive, the hammer clause provision is unfair. If the 
insured’s contesting of the claim in the above example had produced a lower total outlay (e.g., the 
jury returned a verdict of only $250,000 rather th an $750,000) he would not have benefited from the 
lower settlement figure, as would the insurer. However, in the illustration, above, since he chose to contest the claim, the insured was forced to ab sorb $400,000 of additiona l defense and settlement 
costs on an out-of-pocket basis ($250K settlement + $150 defense). But in this second scenario, the 
hammer clause conveyed a windfall (in the form of  a lower judgment) on the insurer, while placing 
all the risk of an adverse result (i.e ., a higher judgment) on the insured.  
Problems with the Hammer Clause 
Despite the fact that the manner in  which this provision applies is  clear and unambiguous, there are 
two problems inherent in the hammer clause. Firs t, few authoritative court decisions have ever 
directly addressed the enforceability of this clause.  Second, insurers are therefore reluctant to 
adamantly enforce it because to do so might ultimatel y produce a bad faith claim against them. This is 
especially true if, for example, an insurer recommended a $2 million settlement amount, but the insured refused to allow it, deciding instead to litig ate the matter to its conclusion. In the event the 
insured is ultimately adjudicated as not liable, (i.e., the insured takes the case to trial rather than settling it and receives a verdict of no liability), the insurer would, under the terms of the policy, have no responsibility for the additional defense costs incurr ed after the insured’s refusal to settle. This is 
despite the fact that the insurer had saved a substantial sum by not settling the claim, a course of action based solely on the insured’s urging!  
Given potential scenarios of this kind, the hammer clause is rarely enforced on a “direct” basis, 
whereby an insured ends up handling his or her ow n defense. Rather, in actual practice, insurers 
typically explain to insureds the disadvantages this  provision can impose, should the insured contest a 
claim settlement that an insurer has recommended. And as a result, virtually all claims are settled 
according to an insurer’s recommendation. 
Coinsurance Hammer Clause 
As already explained, the hammer clause does have  the potential to place insureds in a difficult 
position during the claim settlement process. However, a recent trend that is favorable for insureds is for insurers to offer a “coinsura nce hammer clause.” Such a provision provides for a sharing of any 
settlement or judgment that is larger than the se ttlement amount the insurer wanted the insured to 
accept, plus coverage of additional defense costs incu rred in continuing to contest the claim. The most 
common sharing percentage is 50/50, but it can go higher (e.g., 70 percent insurer/30 percent 
insured). 
For example, assume an insurer wanted to settle  a claim for $100,000 but the insured refused to 
consent. The claim is eventually settled for $200,000,  and $50,000 in additional defense costs are also 
incurred following the insured’s refusal to consen t. Under these conditions, the insurer would pay: 
• 50 percent of the additional settlement figure (i.e., 50 percent of $100,000) , or $50,000,  plus 
• $25,000 in additional defense costs (i.e., 50% of $50,000), plus  
• $100,000, the originally recommended settle ment amount, for a total of $175,000.  
In contrast, under a typical “hammer clause” without  a coinsurance provision, the insurer would not 
have paid any of the additional settlement or defense costs.  Chapter 2—Insuring Agreements

23 Chapter 3 
Limits, Deductibles/Retentions, and Coinsurance 
There are both similarities and differences in the wa ys in which limits, de ductibles/retentions, and 
coinsurance clauses are applied under professional liability policies. This discussion addresses key 
elements of these provisions.  
Limits 
Professional liability insurance policies use one of three methods in providing policy limits. 
• Single, Annual Aggregate Limit.  A policy contains only a single, annual aggregate limit 
(also called a “combined single limit”). Such limits indicate the maximum amount that can be paid out on the insured’s behalf during a given policy year. The aggregate can be applied to both indemnity payments and defense costs—in any proportion and irrespective of the number of different claims or claimants. An example of this is a policy with a $1 million 
annual aggregate limit. Under such a policy, $1 million is the most the insurer will pay, 
regardless of the number of claims made during the policy term. It could, for example, pay 3 claims of $100,000, $300,000,  and $600,000, respectively, which totals $1 million. Or, it 
could pay a single $1 million claim, during the term of the policy.  
• Equal Per Claim and Annual Aggregate Limits.  A policy contains both a per claim and an 
annual aggregate limit that are equal to each ot her. In actual practice, however, such policies 
operate in a manner identical to those using the language described above. An example of this 
is a policy with a $1 million annual aggregate limit and a $1 million per claim limit. 
• Unequal Per Claim and Annual Aggregate Limits. A policy contains both a per claim limit and an annual aggregate limit where the limits ar e not identical (with the aggregate typically 
being two to three times the “per claim” lim it). For example, a hospital professional liability 
policy is written with limits of $1 million/$3 million. This means that $1 million is the most 
the insurer will pay on any one claim and that $3  million is the most the insurer will pay for 
all claims, during the policy period.

24 Related Claims Provisions 
Related claims provisions, also sometimes called “interrelated” claims or “interrelated acts” 
provisions, are found in nearly all types of PL and ML policy forms. Related claims provisions apply 
to situations in which more than one claim resu lts from a single wrongful act or from what the policy 
defines as a series of “related wrongful acts.” More  specifically, related claims provisions state the 
following. 
Limits 
If more than one claim results from a single wrongful act or a series of related wrongful acts, the 
insured receives the protection provided by the limit of coverage applicable when the first claim was made, rather than the sum of the limits that were applicable to the policy periods during which all the 
claims were made (if claims are made against th e insured during more than one policy period).  
Deductibles/Retentions 
If more than one claim results from a single wrongful act or a series of related wrongful acts, only one 
deductible/retention applies to all of the claims.  
Application of Related Claim s Provisions: An Example 
The following scenario offers an example of how a related claims provision functions. An architect 
purchased professional liability policies (written on a claims-made basis) with the following terms: 
January 1, 2009–2010, January 1, 2010–2011, and January 1, 2011– 2012, at limits of $1 million, $2 
million, and $3 million, respectively. The architect draws plans for a structure and seals the plans on 
January 1, 2005. Construction is completed 2 years later, on January 1, 2007. On January 1, 2009, a portion of the building collapses and injures three people. Each of these individuals makes claims 
against the architect on July 1, 2009, July 1, 2010,  and July 1, 2011, respec tively. All three claims 
resulted from the same wrongful act (i.e., the def ective building design), yet the claims in this 
example are made during three different policy pe riods. Under these circumstances, only one policy 
limit (i.e., the $1 million limit applicable during th e January 1, 2009–2010 policy period) would apply 
to all three claims, because that was the year in  which the first claim arising from the original 
wrongful act was made. In addition, only one de ductible/retention would apply, because the three 
claims resulted from just one wrongful act. 
Exhaustion of Limits Provisions 
Most policies state that once their limits have been  exhausted by any combination of claim payments 
and/or defense expenditures, the insurer’s duty to  defend any and all claims against the insured 
ceases.  
Exhaustion of Limits Applies to Am ounts Paid, Not to Amounts Reserved 
It should be pointed out that exhaustion of limits clauses apply only to situations where payments—
rather than reserves—have exceeded  limits. For example, assume that an insured against whom three 
claims were pending had a $1 million policy lim it. If the insurer had reserved $500,000 (for 
settlement and defense costs) for each of the thr ee claims, the insurer’s obligation to continue 
defending the insured would not cease until $1 million had actually been paid out on the insured’s 
behalf (in any combination of settlement and/or de fense costs, across any combination of the three 
claims), despite the fact that the initial reserve  exceeded the insured’s $1 million policy limit.  Chapter 3—Limits, Deductibles/Retentions, and Coinsurance 
25 Deductibles/Retentions 
Nearly all PL policies contain either deductib le or self-insured retention provisions.  
Deductibles versus Retentions 
Under a policy written with a deductible provision, the insurer pays the defense and indemnity costs 
associated with a claim—including the deductib le amount—and then seeks reimbursement of the 
deductible payment from the insured. For exampl e, assume a policy is written with a $10,000 
deductible. A claim is settled for a total of $100, 000 (defense and indemnity payments). In this 
situation, the insurer will pay the entire $100,000 an d then bill the insured for the $10,000 deductible 
amount. 
Under a policy written with a retention provision, th e insured pays defense and/or indemnity costs 
associated with a claim until the retention amount is reached. After that point, the insurer would make 
any additional payments for defense and indemn ity that were covered by the policy.   
For example, assume a D&O liability policy is written with a $100,000 re tention. The insured 
directors and officers, as well as the corporate entity , are sued by a claimant who alleges securities 
fraud. The corporation will pay the first $100,000 in defense and indemnity amounts that are incurred in conjunction with the claim. After that point , the insurer will pay all subsequent defense and 
indemnity costs (until the policy limit is reached).  
Retentions are generally written for larger organiza tions, such as corporations insured under directors 
& officers liability coverage or hospitals cove red by hospital professional liability coverage. 
Conversely, deductibles are found in PL policies written for smaller professional liability insureds, 
such as solo practitioners in law, medicine, or accounting and even for larger group practices. 
Anti-Stacking/Batch Clause Provisions  
As recognized by the related claims provision already discussed, it is not uncommon for a single 
wrongful professional act to produce more than one claim. For example, assume that as part of a 
company-wide layoff, 25 African-American workers are terminated. In response, they bring a class 
action discrimination claim against their former employer. 
Given the financial hardship the corporation would suffer in having to absorb 25 
deductibles/retentions—despite having the fact that  all 25 claims emanated from a single event—PL 
and ML policies often include what are known as anti-stacking provisions, also known as “batch 
clauses.” They state that only one deductible/retention applies per wrongful act. This is irrespective of 
the number of occurrences or number of claimants that are produced by an individual wrongful act.  
Anti-stacking provisions are critical for insureds since they prevent the application of multiple 
deductibles/retentions in the event that more th an one claim results fro m a single wrongful act.  
Aggregate Deductibles/Retentions 
An annual aggregate deductible is advantageous fo r an insured because it caps the amount the insured 
would be required to absorb in the event that  multiple claims—from more than a single wrongful 
act—were made against an insured in a single y ear. Nevertheless, few professional liability policies 
contain aggregate deductibles. There are  two reas ons for this: (1) professional liability claims are 
more “severity-driven” than “frequency-driven,” and (2) most (although, admittedly, not all) 
professional liability policies cover only a limited number of persons so that the chances of more than one claim being made against an in sured during a single policy period is relatively low. Admittedly, a Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
26 multiplicity of claims in a single year could be a potential problem for certain insured professional 
organizations, e.g., a 150-person law firm or a la rge hospital. From a practical standpoint, multiple 
claims within a single policy period are generally much less of a concern for more typical insureds 
under a professional liability policy, e.g., a five-p erson accounting firm, a sole practitioner attorney, 
an eight-person technology consu lting firm. Nevertheless, aggregate deductibles/retentions are 
advantageous for insureds and e fforts should be made to include them, especially within policies 
covering more than 25 people.  
Reduced Deductible Amount Options 
In recent years, professional liability insurers writi ng various lines of covera ge have begun to offer 
policies that contain options for a reduced de ductible/retention amounts—with no commensurate 
increase in premium. Such options are typically co ntingent upon the insured’s taking certain actions 
under specific circumstances, which are discussed below.  
The Rationale for Reduced Deductibles 
The purpose of reduced deductible provisions is to  encourage certain activities that will either (1) 
prevent claims from being made against the insure d or (2) mitigate the eventual dollar amount of 
claims once they are made. The following are three examples of circumstances under which insurers sometimes offer a reduced deductible under professional liability policies.  
• Early Reports of “Incidents.”  An architects and engineer s insurer agrees to reduce a 
$10,000 deductible to $5,000 fo r no additional premium charge . The reduced deductible will 
apply to any claim which the insured originally  reported as an “incident” that appeared to 
have the potential to give rise to a claim in the future, despite the fact that no formal claim has yet been made. When an insured reports su ch incidents before a formal claim is made, 
this allows the insurer to evaluate the incide nt and, if it deems appropriate, the insurer can 
promptly begin investigating the circumstances surrounding it. Then, depending upon the 
circumstances, the insurer might make a “pre emptive” settlement offer. Such action often 
prevents a claim from being made at all or will at least minimize the extent of ultimate damages, given the opportunity for early insurer intervention. (It should be recognized that 
the insurer’s obligation to apply the lower, $5,000 deductible attaches, regardless of the 
ultimate disposition of the claim. The intent of th is provision is to encourage early reports of 
incidents because the sooner an insurer becom es involved in the claim handling process, the 
better the chances of resolving it for a reasonable amount.)  
• Arbitration Agreements with Clients.  A lawyers professional liability insurer writes a 
policy with a $2,500 deductible for the same premium as one containing a $5,000 deductible. 
This option is available for law firms that requi re their clients to sign an agreement stating 
that all disputes between the clients and the fi rm will be subject to mandatory arbitration 
rather than the traditional court system. Such a provision is likely to mitigate the dollar amount of potential damages because instead of  suing the attorney, clients must submit the 
dispute to arbitration. This is likely to be less expensive than standard litigation, from the 
standpoint of both defense and settlement costs.  
• Pre-Termination Consultations with Employment Attorneys. An employment practices 
liability policy contains a provision that redu ces the deductible by 50 percent for wrongful 
termination claims. This reducti on is conditioned upon the insu red having consulted with and 
followed the recommendations of a labor law firm—provided by the insurer—prior to 
terminating employees. The rationale for this provi sion is that by encouraging the insured to Chapter 3—Limits, Deductibles/Retentions, and Coinsurance 
27 consult with the law firm prior to taking a termination action, potential damages will be 
reduced because the insured w ill receive expert advice regarding matters such as severance 
pay, the wording of releases, exit interviews, and other important issues involving employee 
terminations.  
Coinsurance Provisions 
Coinsurance provisions are sometim es found in several lines of PL and ML coverage, most notably in 
employment practices liability and directors and offi cers liability policy forms. They are, however, 
uncommon. This is especially true during soft in surance market conditions when competition between 
insurers is strong and few buyers (except those cons idered within the “difficult to insure” category, 
such as professionals who have a number of claims made against them) are willing to accept 
coinsurance provisions.  
Coinsurance provisions state that the insured must contribute a certain percentage of the costs 
associated with the defense and settlement of ever y claim. Normally, the coinsurance percentage 
ranges from 5 percent to 30 percent per claim. They operate in a fashion identical to that used in 
healthcare insurance policies, whereb y an insured, for example, might be required to pay, on an out-
of-pocket basis, 20 percent of the first $10,000 of all costs on a given claim. 
Typically, coinsurance provisions are noted on the d eclarations page of a professional liability policy. 
Most often, the declarations page will contain a blank line, in which the applicable coinsurance 
percentage is filled in. 
Purpose and Operation of Coinsurance Provisions 
There are two purposes of coinsurance provisions. First, they provide the insured with a direct financial interest or so-called “skin in the gam e” during the claim settlement process. (This is often 
important, depending on the particular circumstan ces surrounding a lawsuit against an insured, 
especially in D&O and EPL claims). Second, they provide an incentive for the insured to prevent losses, given the fact that he or she will be requi red to contribute a significant portion to any claim 
settlement or judgment.

Conditions 
Conditions in ML and PL policy forms state the resp ective rights and the requirements applicable to 
both the insured and insurer under the policy. Altho ugh sometimes considered “boilerplate” material, 
conditions sections can have a material effect on the actual scope of coverage the policy provides. 
The major policy conditions that will be discussed in  this section include (1) notice of cancellation, 
nonrenewal, and premium/coverage change; (2) subroga tion; (3) other insurance, (4) notice of claim, 
and (5) miscellaneous conditions.  
Notice of Cancellation, Nonrenewal, and Premium/Coverage 
Change 
There is considerable variation between the manner in which the various professional liability 
insurers handle the issue of policy cancellation, n onrenewal, and notice of premium/coverage change. 
Notice of Cancellation 
The majority of PL policies require that the insure d be given 30 days’ notice prior to the date on 
which an insurer will cancel a policy, although a significant minority of insurers’ forms provide 60 
days’ notice prior to cancellation. (In many states, as will be explained in more detail below, the issue 
of whether 30 or 60 day cancellation notice periods is provided, is a matter of statutory insurance 
law.) Still other insurers write policies which cannot be canceled (except for nonpayment of premium or for material misstatements in the application). Various cancellation issues are discussed below.  
Cancellation Due to Nonpayment of Premium 
Under most PL policies, if cancellation is due to n onpayment of premium, the insurer is required to 
provide only 10 days’ notice to the insured. 
Cancellation for Mate rial Misrepresentation in the Application 
A few insurers’ forms state that they will cancel the policy in the event that  the insured has included 
material misrepresentations within the application fo r coverage. This is appropriate since the coverage 
provided by a PL or ML policy is issued in relian ce upon the truth of the information found within the 
application. Material misrepresentations refer to false information regarding critical aspects of a professional liability risk. To illustrate: assume an applicant for physicians professional liability 
coverage failed to reveal that within the past 5 years, prior insurers settled three claims totaling 
$500,000 on his behalf. This w ould be considered a material misrepresentation because had the 
insurer known about the claims, it may not have agre ed to write a policy or would have charged a 
higher premium. On the other hand, if the physician stated in his application that he had been Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
32 practicing medicine for 20 years, when, in fact, he had only been practicing for 15 years, this would 
probably not be viewed as a material misrepresentation. 
Cancellation by the Insured Requires No Advance Notice 
Although, as stated above, insurers are required to provide some notice period prior to cancellation, 
insureds are generally permitted to cancel polici es with no advance notice. However, under these 
circumstances, premium is refunded on what is known as a short-rate basis, i.e., 90 percent of the pro-
rata unearned premium. . Thus, if a 1-year policy with a $10,000 premium was in effect for 6 months, 
at which time it was canceled by the insured, a $4,5 00 refund would be due the insured (50 percent of 
$10,000 = $5,000, less 10 percent = $4,500). Conversely, if the insurer cancels, premium is always 
refunded on a pro rata basis with no short-rate pena lty, so that in the previous example, the insured 
would receive a $5,000 premium refund.  
The Effect of State Am endatory Endorsements on C ancellation Provisions 
Notice provisions are often extended by the attachment  of state amendatory endorsements which, by 
law, must be appended to all insurance policies wr itten in a given state. An amendatory endorsement 
is filed with the state insurance department to bring the form into compliance with that state’s 
insurance laws. (However, this requirement does not, in all cases, apply to nonadmitted insurers, 
many of which write professional liability covera ge.) While amendatory endorsements may amend 
any number of policy terms and conditions, the terms most frequently amended are the notice 
provisions. Specifically, such endorsements often stat e that the minimum cancellation notice period is 
60 days.   
Broadening Standard Cancellation Notice Provisions 
The insured should make efforts to broaden the terms of the standard cancellation provisions 
discussed above. In the event that an insurer cancel s a policy, significantly more than 30 days is 
typically required to apply for and negotiate repl acement of most types of PL and ML insurance. 
Therefore, when the applicable cancellation noti ce period is less than 60 days, attempts should be 
made to include a manuscript provision modifyi ng standard cancellation terms so the insurer is 
required to give at least 60—and preferably 90—days’ notice prior to cancellation. This is especially 
important when a state amendatory endorsement does not apply, and the insurer is required to provide 
only 30 days notice prior to cancelling a policy.  
Notice of Nonrenewal 
Some PL forms include a provision requiring that the insurer give the insured advance notice if it 
intends not to renew the policy. When offered, this period is typically 30, 45, or 60 days and is often 
the same notice period the insurer is required to gi ve for cancellation. The specific notice period that 
must be given to an insured prior to  nonrenewal is  nearly always mandated by state law and in such 
cases would be specified in that state’s amendatory endorsement.  
Why Notice of Nonrenewal Cannot Always be Provided 
Even if they act in good faith, insurers are not al ways able to provide advance notice of their intent 
not to renew. This is because information submitte d on a renewal application may indicate a change 
in the insured’s operations (e.g., new types of service s or clients, larger/smaller staff) which no longer 
meet the insurer’s underwriting guidelines. For example, a lawyers professional insurer may only Chapter 4—Conditions 
33 write coverage for firms of less than 20 lawyers. If a firm expands beyond this number, the insurer 
will no longer cover the firm.   
To further illustrate, a certain kind of claim may be  reported late in a policy period, which could also 
indicate that the exposure might no longer comply with the insurer’s underwriting requirements. For 
example, a law firm may report a securities claim made  against it, indicating that its attorneys have 
begun to practice in this high-risk area of the la w. The insurer’s underwriting guidelines may state 
that it will not cover firms practicing securities law. 
Thus, unless an insured can provide a timely renewal a pplication, it is often difficult for an insurer to 
guarantee a nonrenewal notice period. Therefore, it is best that an insured submit renewal applications 
90 (or at least 60) days prior to policy expiration.  Under these circumstances, an insurer would be 
better able to provide advance notice of nonrenew al for the kinds of underwriting reasons noted 
above.  
Notice of Premium/Coverage Change 
There are two other situations in which it is valuab le for an insured to be given advance notice of an 
insurer’s intentions regarding changes in the term s of a renewal policy: (1) when the renewal policy 
will contain a material increase in premium and (2) when it will include a material restriction in the 
scope of coverage. 
It is, of course, impossible to indicate exactly what  constitutes “material” in either of these instances. 
In the first case, a doubling of premium would clearly fit the definition of a material increase in 
premium. In the second instance, if half of an insu red attorney’s practice was made up of real estate 
limited partnership syndication work, and in a renewal policy an insurer decided to exclude this exposure entirely, such action would also fit any r easonable definition of a material restriction in 
coverage. On the other hand, if the renewal premium were to increase by 10 percent and if real estate 
syndication work constituted only 2 percent of the attorney’s practice, such changes, while not 
unimportant, may not be considered material. 
Despite such ambiguities as to what exactly constitutes “material,” it is advant ageous for an insured’s 
professional liability insurance policy to contain wording that provides: 
• Advance notice 60 days prior to cancellation  
• An equal notice period in the event of the insurer’s intention to nonrenew  
• Advance notice if the insurer decides to  renew at a materially higher price  
• Advance notice in the event that the insurer intends to renew with a material restriction in the 
scope of coverage  
Subrogation Provisions 
Subrogation is the assignment to an insurer from an  insured, under the terms of the policy and after 
payment of a loss, of the rights of the insured, to  recover the amount of the paid loss from the party 
legally liable for causing the loss. For example, an insured hospital is sued by a patient who is injured 
when a doctor negligently performs surgery on the patient at the insured’s hospital. The hospital’s professional liability insurer makes a payment to the injured patient on the hospital’s behalf. Under 
the terms of virtually all professional liability insurance policy forms, the professional liability insurer 
would then have the right to collect the amount of its payment on behalf of the hospital, from the 
doctor who negligently performed the surgery. As a condition of indemnifying the insured hospital, Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
34 the hospital would first be required to sign a release of all claims against the negligent doctor, because 
in the absence of such a release, the hospital would also have the right to pursue a claim against the 
doctor. The release prevents this situation from happening, which would amount to “double 
indemnity” for the hospital. By obtaining the release,  the insurer then has the right to collect the 
amount of its payment (on behalf of the hospital)  from the negligent doctor who was responsible for 
causing the claim. So now, the insurer “stands in the shoes” of the hospital as to the right to seek 
payment from the doctor.  
Subrogation Waivers Prior to a Loss 
Standard subrogation provisions sometimes allow insu reds to waive subrogation prior to a loss. For 
instance, a project owner, as a condition of doing business with all design firms, may require that 
engineers waive their rights to subrogate against th e owner in the event the owner is responsible for 
causing a professional liability claim to be made against the engineers. Under these conditions, most 
professional liability insurers would be agreeable to allowing this waiver. 
While most professional liability polic ies do not bar arrangements of th is kind, a few forms explicitly 
prohibit subrogation waivers even before a loss. Fo r this reason, subrogation provisions need to be 
studied and, if an insured has waived subrogation against any third parties, the underwriter should be 
notified. In such instances, either the policy must  be modified to allow such arrangements or the 
contractual agreement waiving subrogation should be rescinded. Even if their policies contain provisions barring subrogation prior to a loss, underw riters will usually agree to waive subrogation, 
provided they are given appropriate details as to why it  is important for an insured to do so (as in the 
example above) and in return for additional premium. 
Subrogation Waivers are Neve r Permitted after a Loss 
On the other hand, virtually no insurers’ forms allow insureds to waive subrogation after a loss. To do 
so would clearly violate the principle of indemnity. 
Waiver of Subrogation Against Insureds 
Most professional liability insurance policies cont ain provisions that prevent the insurer from 
subrogating against an insured, unless the insured has acted willfully in causing a claim. For example, if an attorney is sued by a client for accident ally missing a filing deadline, this provision would 
prevent an insurer from subrogating against the attorney, after the insurer indemnified the attorney’s client. On the other hand, a few insurers’ form s prevent an insurer from subrogating against an 
insured under any circumstances (e.g., even if the insured’s conduct in causing a claim was 
intentional, such as if a surgeon purposely injured a patient). A provision of this kind is, of course, advantageous from the insured’s point of view. 
Other Insurance  Provisions 
Other insurance provisions deal with situations in which the terms of one or more other policies also 
provide coverage for a professional liability claim that  is insured by a given policy.  Important areas 
involving other insurance provisions include the purposes of other insurance provisions, excess other insurance provisions, and potential conflicts associated with other insurance provisions. 
 
 Chapter 4—Conditions 
35 Purposes of Other Insurance Provisions 
There are two purposes of other insurance claus es in professional liability insurance policies.  
First, they are aimed at preserving the principle of  indemnity. Specifically, their intent is to prevent 
possible moral hazard by making certain that an insu red is not also compensated for the same claim 
by more than one insurance policy. In effect, other insurance clauses prevent a professional from 
making a profit as a result of a claim being made against him or her because he or she maintained multiple policies.  
The second rationale for other insurance provisions is to allocate the payment of claims between 
insurers. In effect, other insuran ce clauses prevent an insurer from profiting by not contributing to the 
payment of a claim that it rightfully insured, when a claim is also covered by another insurer’s policy. 
Excess Other Insurance Clauses 
Nearly all professional liability insurance policies are written to apply as excess insurance in the event 
that another policy exists. In actual practice, and as a matter of law in many jurisdictions, if two 
policies cover the same claim and both contain th is provision, both are primary and must pay the 
claim on a pro rata basis, i.e., in proportion to thei r respective limits. Assume that an insured has two 
PL policies (both with excess “other insurance” clau ses) that cover a claim; Policy A has a $500,000 
limit and Policy B has a $1 million limit. Defense and indemnity payments applicable to a claim made against the insured total $150,000. In this s ituation, insurer A will pay $50,000 and Insurer B 
will pay $100,000.     
Potential Other Insurance Provision Conflicts 
Another important area in which conflicts can ari se from other insurance clauses in professional 
liability insurance policies involves situations where an insured professional is also an insured under 
another professional or general liability policy. Fo r instance, a nurse who carries professional liability 
of his or her own may also be an insured under th e PL policy of the hospital where she is employed. 
Such situations could give rise to conflicts regarding primacy.  
Therefore, if a professional carrying PL coverage also has insured status under other entities’ policies, 
the issue of conflicts must be discussed with underwriters. The underwriters may wish to add a manuscript endorsement that clarifies the capacity and/or acts for which the individual is covered 
under the professional liability policy. It should also address the conditions under which each of the two policies will primary and which will be excess. Nevertheless, the general rule  in situations such 
as these is that the employer’s policy is primary. 
Notice of Claim Provisions 
Most professional liability policies require the insured to promptly notify the in surer in the event that 
a claim is made against the insured. The purpose of a policy’s notice provision is to prevent an insurer 
from being placed at a disadvantage in investigating and defending a claim because notification of the circumstances surrounding the allegations was delayed.   
“Notice” to Agent or Broker Does Not Constitute “Notice” 
It is significant to realize that according to caselaw in a number of jurisdictions, notice of claim to an 
insured’s broker often does not constitute notice to  the insurer so as to comply with standard PL 
policy notice provisions. This is because brokers ar e technically representatives of insureds, rather 
than insurers. Complicating this situation is the f act that the lines of distinction between brokers and Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
36 agents are often blurred, so that it is frequently arguable as to whether a person is acting as a broker or 
an agent in any given situation. Thus, soon after an  insured reports a claim or possible claim to an 
agent or broker, the agent or broker should send th e insured professional a copy of the letter in which 
the agent/broker formally reported the claim to the in surer. (A “claim” refers to a formal request for 
money damages, usually in the form of a lawsuit. A “possible claim” is a situation that could, but has 
not yet resulted in a “claim.” For example, afte r issuing a restatement of its financial data, a 
corporation may consider notifying its D&O insurer,  since financial restatements frequently, although 
not always, trigger claims against a company’s directors and officers.) This procedure will provide confirmation that the policy’s notice provision has be en complied with completely. Alternatively, the 
insured can notify the insurer dir ectly in the event of a claim, thereby avoiding potential problems 
relating to this issue. Typically, the title of the person designated to receive notice at the insurer, as well as the address of the insurer, is specified in the policy’s notice provision, which allows the insured to notify the insurer directly.  
Miscellaneous Conditions 
There are several other “miscellaneous” PL and ML policy conditions that can have a meaningful 
effect on the manner in which the policies function, including the following. 
• Prohibition of Voluntary Payments and Settlements 
• Cooperation Clause 
• Legal Action Against the Insurer Provision 
• Mandatory Arbitration Provision  
• Nontransferability Provision 
• Severability Provision 
• Continuation of Coverage in Bankruptcy Provision 
Prohibition of Voluntary Payments and Settlements 
Nearly all PL policies contain language barring th e insured from making any voluntary payments to 
settle claims made against them without first obtaini ng the insurer’s consent. Such provisions prohibit 
the insured from (1) admitting liability, (2) assuming future obligations to compensate a claimant, (3) making payments to a claimant, or (4) incurri ng any other expenses (e.g., defense costs) in 
conjunction with a claim.  
The purpose of such language is to assist the insurer in defending against a claimant’s legal action by 
preventing the insured from waiving his or her rights associated with the claim. By taking any of the 
actions noted above, an insured coul d be foregoing both his or her, as well as an insurer’s, right to 
later deny liability in conjunction with a claim that is made against it.  
“Goodwill” Insurance versus Legal Liability Insurance 
In some instances, insureds do not always realize that their PL policy is not “goodwill insurance.” In 
effect, the policies are not intended to provide cove rage if, after they are rendered, the insured’s 
services are not to a client’s liking—regardless of the fact that the insured committed no error or 
omission and met (or exceeded) normal professiona l standards in rendering those services. For 
example, if a critically ill patient dies on the operating table—through no fault of the surgeon 
attempting to save his life—the surgeon would not be legally liable if the patient’s estate later file a Chapter 4—Conditions 
37 wrongful death claim against him. Accordingly, un der such circumstances, the surgeon should not 
voluntarily offer to make a payment to the patient’s survivors.  
Voluntary payment provision clauses are included in policies to prevent insureds (in situations 
comparable to the one described above) from waiv ing their insurer’s rights in defending professional 
liability claims made against them. In the event that  the physician in this example had promised the 
patient’s family a sum of money in compensation,  the insurer would have a difficult time in later 
denying the surgeon’s liabi lity when it begins to conduct a defense on the surgeon’s behalf. In short, 
the purpose of such provisions is to prevent insu reds from prejudicing their cases when defense must 
later be conducted. Voluntary payment provisions ar e therefore intended to preclude insureds from 
committing insurers to (sometimes) unwarranted financia l obligations with their clients, their patients, 
or with claimants.  
Cooperation Clause  
Nearly all professional liability policies contain clauses that compel insureds to make “reasonable 
efforts” to assist and cooperate with the insurer in defending claims made against them. Such 
provisions are necessary because insureds someti mes believe that because the insurer’s money—
rather than their own—is at stake, the insurer, ra ther than the insured, should be the party to expend 
the time and effort necessary to defend claims under the policy. However, since the insured is the 
party directly cognizant of the facts surrounding claims, it is virtually impossible to conduct an effective defense in the absence of  cooperation from the insured.  
Legal Action Against the Insurer 
The majority of PL and ML policies include provisions stating that the insured cannot initiate a claim 
against an insurer in conjunction with a coverage dispute unless the insured has first complied with all 
terms of the policy and until an insured’s ultimate lia bility for a claim has been  established. In other 
words, an insured cannot sue an insurer (e.g., for re fusing to provide coverage for a claim or for not 
covering a claim in its entirety) until there has been a settlement or a judgment rendered in connection 
with a professional liability claim made against the insured. Such a provision is sometimes referred to as a “no action” clause. 
The purpose of such language is to prevent lawsuits in  the event that an insure d has not lived up to the 
terms agreed on in the insurance contract (e.g ., breaching the cooperation clause in the policy). 
Another purpose of this provision is to prevent qu estionable litigation until an insured’s actual dollar 
liability for a disputed claim made against him or her has been determined.  
Mandatory Arbitration Provision 
A significant number of PL and ML policies contain provisions that require disputes between the 
insured and the insurer be submitted to binding arbitr ation rather than allowing either party to resort 
to the conventional court system. 
The effect of this provision is to expedite the r esolution of coverage-related controversies, given the 
long delays inherent in the conve ntional U.S. judicial process. Also important is the fact that 
arbitration typically reduces the cost of settling su ch disputes compared to utilizing the traditional 
court system. Although the mandatory arbitration provision benefits both the insurer and the insured 
for these reasons, arbitration affords greater benefit to the insurer. This is because it is generally 
believed that arbitrators are less biased against in surance companies than are judges and juries, as 
evidenced by the rare incidence of astronomical arbitration awards against insurers, compared to the often huge verdicts rendered by juries.  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
38 A Criticism of Arbitration: Insurers Benefit from “Conti nuing Relationships” 
One specific criticism of arbitration stems from the fact that insurers regularly hire arbitrators because 
insurers are repeatedly involved in coverage dis putes. Given their continuing need for the services of 
arbitrators, over time, insurers are in a position to hire arbitrators “more selectively,” so that 
eventually they begin hiring arbitrators whose previous decisions have tended to favor them. 
Conversely, insureds, given the rarity of their par ticipation in the arbitration process, are not in a 
position to select arbitrators whose prior decisions have  appeared to support their interests. For this 
reason, arbitration tends to favor insurers.  
Nontransferability Provisions 
Most PL policies contain wording to the effect that  coverage cannot be automatically transferred to 
another individual or entity without the insurer’s consent. Provisions of this kind, also known as 
nonassignability clauses, are necessary because PL insu rance is based on the underwriter’s desire to 
cover only the named insured. In effect, PL covera ge is considered as personal to the insured.  
For instance, assume that during the term of cove rage an accountant (who is a sole practitioner) sells 
his practice to another accountant. Under these ci rcumstances, the nontransferability provision will 
reserve for the insurer the right not to extend cove rage to the new owner of the practice. Because PL 
policies are personal contracts, the underwriter mu st be given the opportunity to evaluate, offer 
different coverage terms and/or premium, and perh aps reject an individual or entity seeking named 
insured status under the original named insured’s policy. 
Additional Insureds are Rare in Professional Liability Coverage 
A related point associated with nontransferrability provisions is the fact that PL underwriters will rarely agree to name other persons or entities as “a dditional insureds” under their policies. Again, the 
rationale for this position is that the coverage provided under a PL policy is personal to the insured. Absent separate underwriting (as well as payment of premium) of an individual or entity seeking additional insured status, requests for additiona l insured status are almost never granted. 
Severability Provisions 
Severability provisions are included in the major ity of PL and in nearly all ML forms. Such 
provisions indicate that the coverage applies separ ately to each insured under the policy. There are 
two significant implications of severability clauses: (1) they protect so-called “innocent” insureds, and (2) they reinforce the fact that while coverage can apply separately to different insureds, this does 
not increase the limits of the policy. 
Protection of “Innocent Insureds” 
Severability provisions state that if the actions of  one insured voids coverage under the policy, such 
coverage is not invalidated as respects other indi viduals insured by the po licy. For instance, assume 
that one insured attorney commits a criminal act (e .g., he steals money from a client’s trust fund) and, 
as a result, all partners of the law firm are also named in a lawsuit. In this situation, the severability provision of the policy will afford defense coverage  to the other, innocent a ttorneys despite the fact 
that defense coverage would not be available to the culpable lawyer.  
Similarly, severability provisions also become signi ficant when an individual insured intentionally 
provides false information on an application for PL coverage. In a claim situation involving an 
insured that provided false information on a coverage  application, most severability provisions in PL Chapter 4—Conditions 
39 policies would void coverage—but only for that speci fic insured, while providing coverage for those 
insureds who were not aware of a nd were not a party to the false statement made on the application.  
For example, assume the chief financial officer of a corporation intentionally provides false financial 
statements within an application for D&O coverage. Also assume that none of the other officers or 
directors was aware of such falsification. If a clai m is made under the policy, the insurer would have 
the right to void coverage as to the chief financial officer, but under the policy’s severability provision, would still be obligated to cover all of the other “innocent” directors and officers who were 
not aware that the chief financial officer intentionally falsified the application. 
No Increase in Policy Limits 
Severability provisions also intend to clarify the fact that although coverage, at times, can apply 
separately to different individuals, such circumst ances do not increase the policy’s limit of liability. 
For example, under a policy containing a $2 million per-claim limit, a total of only $2 million would be available to defend and pay on behalf of all insureds, regardl ess of how many individuals were 
named in a single lawsuit.  
Continuation of Coverage in Bankruptcy 
Most PL policies indicate that coverage continues wh en an insured has declared bankruptcy. The lack 
of coverage for an otherwise valid claim—desp ite an insured’s bankruptcy declaration—would 
obviously add to the hardships being experienced by an insured under such circumstances. Among 
other things, a coverage denial would make it more difficult for an insured to repay outstanding creditors, thereby impeding the insured’s ev entual return to professional practice.  
Even in the absence of such a provision, as a practic al matter, it would be difficult for an insurer to 
walk away from its obligation to defend and indemnify an otherwise covered claim. Insureds should nevertheless insist that a continuation of coverage  in bankruptcy provision be included in all PL 
policies.

41 Chapter 5 
Exclusions 
Policy exclusions—both those included in the form  itself and those added by endorsement—have a 
profound effect on the scope of coverage pr ovided by professional a nd management liability 
insurance policies. In fact, the forms vary more in their exclusionary language than in any other 
coverage aspect. Consequently, it is necessary to caref ully examine the exclusions contained in all PL 
and ML forms.  
There are four general kinds of exclusions contained within the policies. 
• Exclusions for uninsurable exposures  
• Exclusions removable or modifiable by negotiation, with or without additional premium  
• Exclusions for exposures better suite d to other types of coverage  
• Exclusions for exposures pertaining to a specialized type of work within a given profession  
These different types of exclusions are thoroughly examined later in this section.   
Policy exclusions provide a meaningful basis fo r comparing two professional liability policies. In 
situations where a decision must be made regard ing which one of two or more policies should be 
selected, the presence or absence of certain exclusionary language may serve as a determining factor 
in the selection process.  
Variations between the Scope of the Same Exclusion 
It should also be recognized that there is often a gr eat deal of variation between the scope of the same 
exclusion, from one insurer’s policy form to the ne xt. For example, some policies exclude coverage 
for fraud and criminal acts with no specific language indicating the insurer’s duty to defend against 
allegations of fraud/criminal acts. In contrast, ot her versions of the fraud/criminal acts exclusion 
specifically provide coverage for defense of such claims. Given such significant differences between the same exclusion, it is important to examine the actual exclusionary language appearing in different 
policies when deciding between two othe rwise comparable coverage forms.  
Such variations will be treated in the coverage discussions of the individual professions. The purpose 
of this analysis is to provide a broad overview of  the most common exclusions found in professional 
and management liability policy forms. 
 Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
42 The Duty To Defend Is Broader than the Duty To Indemnify 
Before analyzing the most common exclusions fou nd in professional liability policies, one key point 
to recognize is that even when a policy contains  an exclusion that is worded to exclude both 
indemnity and defense coverage ( known as a “blanket exclusionary pr ovision”), insurers will often  
provide defense coverage for the insured, in spite  of such exclusionary policy language. This is 
because as an industry practice, and according to caselaw, the duty to defend is considered to be 
broader than the duty to indemnify. So unless a clai m or a specific allegation within a claim is clearly 
excluded, insurers will often frequently defend the in sured in situations where it is uncertain as to 
whether coverage applies.    
Uninsurable Exposure Exclusions 
Certain types of activities are not considered to be insurable, regardless of an insured’s willingness to 
pay a premium for coverage. Such exposures are excluded for one of three reasons. 
• Exposures within an insured’s control.  Claims arising from these exposures are, at least to 
some extent, within the control of the insu red (e.g., claims against notaries who notarize 
signatures despite not having signatories  personally appear before them).  
• Insurance is against public policy.  Insurance coverage for the exposure is prohibited by law 
or against public policy (e.g., coverage fo r intentional injury or criminal acts).  
• Economic or business risk.  The exposure represents a business or economic risk that is not a 
proper subject of professional liability coverage  (e.g., claims for the return of professional 
fees).  
It should be mentioned that in many, but not all,  instances, professional liability insurance policies 
will cover the costs associated with the defense of  claims involving these uninsurable exposures. In 
other words, given the language of some exclus ionary provisions, defe nse coverage would be 
available if, for example, a claim was made alle ging that an insured committed a criminal act. 
However, under policies offering this extension, de fense coverage applies only if the allegation is 
ultimately not proven (e.g., the defendant-insured is found innocent by a jury or the charges are 
dropped by a court). Otherwise, the insured would be  responsible for returning defense costs paid on 
its behalf to the insurer, although in actual practice, such reimbursement rarely occurs.  
Following is a discussion of exclusions for uninsurable exposures.  
Notary Claims 
A number of insurers exclude coverage for claims in which, while the insured is acting as a notary, 
the signatory to a document did not actually sign the document in the presence of the notary-insured. 
Exclusions of claims involving notarized documents are most prevalent in policies written for 
lawyers, accountants, real estate brokers, and insura nce agents, whose work often requires them to 
notarize documents.  
The following example provides a scenario of how th is might occur. A claimant, who owns a piece of 
real property, files a lawsuit against an insured real estate broker because the insured notarized a 
document stating that the claimant-owner agreed to  sell a piece of real property to a buyer at an 
agreed price. In reality, the buyer of the prope rty (as noted within the document) forged the 
claimant’s signature and presented the notary with the forged document, but the real estate broker 
notarized the document nonetheless. But since the claimant-owner’s notarized “signature” appeared 
on the contract of sale, he was legally obligated to sell the property at the price stated.  Chapter 5—Exclusions 
43 The rationale for excluding claims in which the signatory did not sign a document in the notary’s 
presence is that preventing the kinds of suits noted  above, is within the control of the insured. 
Certainly, a notary should never notarize a document unless the signatory actually signs the document 
in the notary’s presence—which was not the case in this example.  
Trademark or Copyright Infringement 
A number of PL policies preclude coverage for tradem ark or copyright infringement. Such exclusions 
are most commonly found in professional liability co verage written for architects and engineers. This 
is because design professionals sometimes use or a ppropriate the plans or drawings of another 
architect or engineer within the course of th eir professional activities. With lesser frequency, 
trademark and copyright exclusions are also found in lawyers, accountants, and insurance agents’ professional liability policies.  
The rationale for such exclusions is that acts of  trademark and copyright infringement are usually 
within an insured professional’s control and can ge nerally be prevented with  relatively little diligence 
(e.g., seek permission to appropriate another’s work product by payment of a fee). Another rationale 
for this exclusion is that coverage is availabl e for copyright and trademark infringement under what 
are known as intellectual property liability policies. 
On the other hand, media liability policies, such as those for publishers, advertisers, or broadcasters, 
affirmatively cover claims alleging trademark or co pyright infringement. For such firms, coverage of 
this nature is essential, and for that reason, separ ate policies have been designed to cover these kinds 
of exposures. Such coverage is also essential for media firms, given the frequency of claims alleging 
trademark and copyright infringement, many of wh ich are groundless. For this reason, the defense 
coverage provided by media policies is essential to these organizations. In contrast,  for other types of 
professionals, like architects and engineers,  copy right and trademark infringement represent token 
exposures, which, for the most part, can be pr evented by using a minimum amount of care (e.g., 
seeking permission prior to using or refere ncing the work of others).      
Claims from Prior Policy Periods, Cl aims Reported to Previous Insurers, 
Claims from Known Incidents 
Nearly all PL and ML policies restrict coverage of  claims involving one or more of the following 
three situations: 
• Claims reported to prior insurers;  
• Claims reported under prior policies with the same insurer; or  
• Claims arising from incidents that were, prior to the inception of the policy period, known by the insured to have the potential for resulting in claims (i.e., nonfortuitous claims).  
A “claim” refers to a formal request for money da mages, usually in the form of a lawsuit. An 
“incident” is a situation that could, but has not yet resulted in a “claim.” For example, after being 
terminated, an employee tells his now-former boss “I’m going to sue you and this company for all it’s worth.” Although at that moment the company has no t yet been sued, there is a good possibility that it 
will be in the future. 
Under some policy forms, separate exclusions are used  to eliminate coverage for one or more of these 
three situations. Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
44 The intent of these exclusions is to eliminate coverage for claims that (1) are the responsibility of 
another insurer, or (2) fall within the scope of another policy period within a policy written by the 
current insurer, or (3) should not be covered b ecause the insured was aware of the likelihood that a 
claim would be made, and it is therefore lacking in  fortuity (i.e., the so-called “burning building” 
situation).  
Antitrust Violations 
Antitrust laws prohibit certain mergers of businesses in situations where such combinations would 
create possible monopolies and as a result, inhibit competition within a particular industry.  
Providing coverage for acts involving antitrust violations is against public policy in some 
jurisdictions and thus not within the intended scope of coverage under most professional liability 
policies. Moreover, coverage is also commonly excluded for such acts since prevention of such 
claims is generally within the control of the in sured (e.g., seek legal advice as to the legality of a 
merger, prior to finalizing it).  
Exceptions to the Anti-Trust Exclusion 
Nevertheless, a number of policies do not preclude c overage on an absolute basis, meaning they do 
provide coverage to defend allega tions that the insured violated antitrust laws. Specifically, policies 
designed to cover managed care orga nizations cover defense of antitrus t allegations on an affirmative 
basis and some actually provide coverage for dama ges associated with such  claims. This is because 
antitrust claims are a frequent source of liability for managed care organizations so that coverage of 
this peril is offered in the insurance market. 
Return of Professional Fees 
This exclusion pertains to situations where the client of a professional pays monies to the professional 
for services and then, as a result of errors or omissi ons in the professional’s wo rk, the client demands 
a refund of such fees. If a court were to rule that  the professional was liable to return such monies, a 
policy containing a return of professional fees exclus ion would not provide cove rage for this item of 
the claim.  
Another very common variation of this scenario, under which this exclusion would also apply, is one 
in which a professional performs a project of some sort and then, at its conclusion, seeks payment 
from the client. However, the client is dissatisfied with the work and as a result, refuses to pay the 
professional’s bill. In this situation, a PL policy th at excluded coverage for the return of professional 
fees, would also not cover the professional’s loss sustai ned when the client refused  to pay the bill.  
(It should be noted that some professional liability forms preclude coverage for the return of professional fees within their definitions of “covere d damages” or “loss” rather than in a separate 
exclusion, a concept that was di scussed earlier in this course.) 
Coverage for fees earned under these types of circ umstances are considered by insurers to be a 
business risk that cannot be the subject of professional liability coverage. Rather, the purpose of PL coverage is to cover the results of professional errors (e.g., financial loss, bodily injury, property 
damage) as opposed to reimbursing professionals for th e loss of their fees (i.e., a client’s refusal to 
pay, or, a settlement or judgment in which a prof essional is required to reimburse a fee paid by the 
client) when they do commit errors. Chapter 5—Exclusions 
45 No Exclusion for Cost of Remedial Services 
It should be recognized, however, that professional liability policies do not exclude coverage for the 
cost of remedial services—as long as they are provided by another professional—to correct errors 
committed by the insured professional. This is because the cost of such remedial services is 
considered by insurers as part of the loss sustained by  a claimant that would otherwise have to be paid 
by the claimant on an out-of-pocket basis, in th e event that the insured did not have professional 
liability coverage.  
Illegal Personal Profit 
Claims that insureds have gained personal profit or advantage to which they were not legally entitled 
is another exposure that is considered to be uninsurable. An ex ample of illegal personal profit may 
involve a director of a corporation who owns a firm that is bidding on a contract proposal offered by 
the organization on whose board he sits. If the dir ector’s company wins the bid because he was privy 
to the bids submitted by the competitor firms or to other “inside” information that assisted his 
company in securing the contract, a claim of illegal personal profit could be made. Many professional liability policies and virtually all D&O polic ies exclude coverage for such claims. 
The Importance of “In Fact” Wording 
However, in nearly all professional and D&O liability policies, the wording of this exclusion is such 
that illegal personal profit is excluded only if it has occurred “in fact,” meaning that defense to 
allegations of illegal pers onal profit are covered until or unless it is  factually proven that the insured 
did engage in illegal personal profit-taking. 
Nonpecuniary Relief 
Most of the policies exclude coverage for cl aims demanding nonpecuniary relief, which means 
nonmonetary damages. For example, assume that an insurance agent promises to obtain coverage for 
a client under a certain type of policy at a specific premium. If the agent were unable to locate an 
insurer willing to write such a policy, given the presence of an exclusion of claims for nonpecuniary 
relief, the agent’s insurer would not provide a policy of insurance for the client under these circumstances. Exclusions precluding coverage fo r nonpecuniary relief are necessary, because in 
many instances, it would be literally impossible to provide the actual relief sought by a claimant (i.e., 
no insurer may be able to write the specific type of policy requested by the client and promised by the 
insurance agent, in the example above).  
Actual Monetary Damages are Covered 
On the other hand, if a claimant were to sue an agent because the claimant suffered an actual 
monetary loss arising from the agent’s failure to secu re a policy, coverage would apply. For instance, 
assume an agent promised to obtain property covera ge on a building that was readily insurable. If the 
agent forgets to secure coverage and a week later,  the building burns to th e ground, the agent’s PL 
policy would cover his liability to the client for failing to secure c overage on the building. Coverage 
applies in this situation because the client has sustained an actual monetary loss (i.e., the value of the building). In contrast, no coverage would apply if the agent forgot to obtain coverage but the building 
sustained no damage. Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
46 Coverage for Defense of Nonpecuniary Actions 
One final important point: unless specifically excluded, defense costs for claims demanding 
nonpecuniary relief will generally be covered. In some  instances, a policy may affirmatively state that 
such coverage is available. Thus, in the above example and assuming no damage to the building, if 
the client were to sue the insu rance agent for failing to obtain a policy and yet demanded that he 
obtain one, the agent’s PL insurer would provide defense coverage to the agent. 
Bankruptcy of Insured 
Most policies exclude coverage for claims arisi ng from claims that result from the insolvency or 
bankruptcy of a professional. For instance, if a pr ofessional experiences financial difficulties, and as a 
result cannot complete a project or engagement, ther e would be no coverage for providing him or her 
with funds to complete the project or to pay an other professional to do so. Nor does the policy cover 
any costs associated with the insure d’s failure to meet his or her business obligations, such as to pay 
monies owed to suppliers, vendors, or other credito rs. The rationale behind this exclusion is that it 
prevents the insurer from becoming a surety. 
Coverage for Nonbankruptcy-Related Claims Applies 
On the other hand, the exclusion does not preclude coverage for garden-variety professional liability 
claim situations in which the insured’s neg ligence causes damage to a client. Under such 
circumstances, the professional’s declaration of bankruptcy does not relieve him or her of the 
obligation to make the client “whole.” Therefore,  this exclusion does not relieve an insurer from 
indemnifying the insured, simply because he or she has declared bankruptcy. (Note that this approach 
“complements” the “continuation of coverage in ba nkruptcy” policy provision discussed earlier in 
this course under the Conditions section.)  
Intentional/Criminal/Fraudul ent/Willful/Dishonest Acts 
Most professional liability policies contain exclusions  for coverage of intentional acts. However, 
there are numerous situations in which a claim results from acts that were intentional on the insured’s part, but the result of the act was unintentional. For example, a surgeon may have intentionally performed a procedure in a certain way but injured a patient in the process. Accordingly, PL policies 
typically qualify intentional acts exclusions so that there is coverage, unless the act is performed 
maliciously, willfully, or with the deliberate intent to injure. 
Coverage for Defense of Claims Alleging Intentional Acts 
It is also important to recognize that nearly a ll professional liability policies affirmatively provide 
defense coverage if alle gations of willful or criminal acts are made against the insured. If the 
allegations are ultimately proven groundless, most po licy forms state that the insured has the benefit 
of defense cost coverage.  
On the other hand, if the allegations are ultimately proven to be true, the insurer should be entitled to 
reimbursement of the defense costs that have been  paid on the insured’s behalf. (However, according 
to caselaw, insurers have no right to such reimbur sement unless this was agreed upon prior to policy 
inception.)  
Coverage for Defense of Innocent Insureds 
In  addition, most, although not all,  versions of this exclusion are worded so that coverage for so-
called innocent insureds is provided when alle gations of intentional wrongdoing such as fraud and Chapter 5—Exclusions 
47 criminal acts are made against culpable members of  a professional organization and, in addition, other 
innocent persons are also named in a lawsuit. Unde r such policies, the defe nse costs of the innocent 
individuals are covered. In effect, the wording of  this exclusion reinforces the severability provision 
discussed earlier in this course.  
When reviewing PL and ML policies, it is essential to verify that both of these key aspects of defense 
coverage are affirmatively provided:  (1) coverage for defense of alle gations of criminal, willful acts 
and (2) coverage for defending innocent insureds.  
Are These Two Coverage Exceptions Really Necessary? 
Some insurers take the position that an explicit coverage grant for innocent insureds or for defense to allegations of intentional wrongdoi ng is unnecessary. Given the severability principle of contract law, 
as well as severability provisions discussed earlier in th is course, some insurers contend that while an 
insurance policy may be void as respects some in sureds, it nonetheless applies to other insureds. 
Thus, even in the absence of “inno cent insureds” and “defense of al legations” exception wording, an 
insurer would normally be obligated to provide defense under both circumstances.  
In addition, asserting the concept that an insurer’ s duty to defend is br oader than its duty to 
indemnify, some insurers likewise argue that e xplicit coverage for defense of allegations of 
intentional conduct and for innocen t insureds is not necessary under a professional liability policy.  
These arguments notwithstanding, it is nevertheless advantageous for an insured if such wording 
appears in a professional liability policy. Without these provisions, an insured could be forced to 
litigate the issue in the event of a coverage dispute.  
Losses from Professional Guarantees 
Many professional liability policy forms contain exclusions of coverage for loss arising from professional guarantees. (For example, a lawyer might “guarantee” that a criminal defendant-client will be acquitted at trial.) More specifically, the policies preclude coverage for situations in which a claim is made because (1) a professional promises th at a certain result will follow from his or her 
performance and (2) this specific result is not realized.  
To illustrate: prior to open-heart surgery, a cardiologi st promises a patient that after the surgery, he 
will be “permanently cured of heart disease.” A week  after the surgery, the patient dies of a heart 
attack. The patient’s estate sues the doctor, allegi ng that the doctor failed to honor his pre-surgery 
guarantee that the procedure would cure the patient’s heart disease.  
Another example: an insurance broker guarantees that  he can obtain physical damage coverage for a 
client’s warehouse. In fact, the agent is unable to produce such coverage, and soon after informing the 
client, the property is destroyed by fire. The client sues the insurance agent for breach of his 
guarantee.  The rationale for this exclusion is that insurers c onsider a professional’s failure to achieve a specific, 
desired result—in the absence of negligence—as a “b usiness risk” that should not be the subject of 
professional liability insurance coverage.  Rather, insurers intend to cover claims that resu lt when a professional fails to perform in accordance 
with the minimum standards mandated by his or her profession under the specific circumstances that 
gave rise to the claim (which is, in effect, the definition of negligence) and that, as a result, a client 
suffers a loss.  
 Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
48 Guarantees Excluded but Negligence Is Covered 
In the example, noted above, coverage would ha ve been available for the cardiologist, if the 
claimant’s estate could prove that the patient died because the cardiologist was negligent in 
performing the open heart surgical procedure.  
What would not be covered is a situation where a professional did not deliver results that he or she 
“guaranteed” but, in failing to deliver on this guarantee, performed in accordance with accepted 
professional standards.  For example, prior to performing lasik surgery, an ophthalmologist guaranteed a patient 20/20 vision. However, the patient only achieved 20/30   vision, which fell within the standard results for this type of  surgery. Moreover, it was established that the 
ophthalmologist performed the surgery according to  accepted professional standards.  In this 
situation, the exclusion applies and no coverage  is available because the professional was not 
negligent. 
Losses from Accounting and Commingling Practices 
Also within the category of uninsurable “busin ess risks” are claims resulting from accounting and 
commingling losses. For example, as a result of the accounting reconciliation process, a professional 
may discover a shortfall of funds, despite not being able to pinpoint the actual source of such losses. 
This often occurs in professional practices involving the commingling of monies from a number of clients (e.g., in insurance agenci es and stock brokerage offices).  
In addition to the fact that insurers consider su ch losses as uninsurable “business risks,” yet another 
rationale for this exclusion is that comingli ng and accounting losses often result from embezzlement 
or dishonesty of employees and/or partners. As a resu lt, insurers consider losses of this nature to fall 
within the scope of crime or employee dishonesty coverage, rather th an professional liability 
insurance.  
Removable/Modifiable Exclusions 
In some instances, underwriters impose exclusions that can be removed from the policy—or at least 
modified—sometimes without the need to pay an additional premium. There are four common exclusions that fall into this category. 
• Failure to maintain insurance  
• Contractual liability  
• Insured versus insured  
• Prior and pending litigation  
Brief, separate discussions of these exclusions follow.  
Failure To Maintain Insurance Exclusion 
Some professional liability policies, particularly D&O liability insurance forms, contain exclusions 
precluding coverage for claims resulting from the failure of insureds to purchase and maintain insurance coverage. This exclusi on might be applicable if, for example, a corporation failed to 
purchase flood insurance and, as a result, suffered a se vere uninsured loss at one of its manufacturing 
plants, resulting in a quarterly loss for the organization and a consequent drop in share price.  
  Chapter 5—Exclusions 
49 If stockholders were to sue the company’s directors and officers, alleging that their negligence in not 
buying flood insurance caused the firm’s share price to drop, an insurer could invoke the failure to 
maintain insurance as a rationale for denying coverage.  
Removing the Exclusion 
Fortunately, many D&O insurers are willing to delete  the failure to maintain insurance exclusion, 
often without an additional premiu m charge, provided the insured fu rnishes the underwriter with a 
current schedule of property and liability insurance. This schedule normally reveals any obvious gaps or omissions of needed coverage and, after revi ewing documentation of this  kind, underwriters will 
sometimes remove the exclusion. 
Exclusions for Insuranc e-Related Operations 
A few versions of the failure to maintain insura nce exclusion also contain restrictions on claims 
involving the insured’s participation in risk-beari ng operations such as captive insurance companies 
and risk retention groups. Both for-profit and nonpr ofit organizations sometimes band together with 
firms in similar industries to form such risk-bearing entities.  
If a professional or D&O liability policy form’s version of the failure to maintain insurance exclusion 
insurance also encompasse s these kinds of risk-bearing operations and entities, separate coverage is 
required to provide coverage  for such operations.  
Contractual Liability Exclusion 
Contractual liability exclusions preclude coverage for situations where one professional agrees to 
hold another professional harmless in  conjunction with work performed  on a subcontracted basis. For 
instance, assume that accountant “A” subcontracts a portion of an engagement to accountant “B.” 
Also assume that “B” agrees to hold “A” harmless for any claims made against “A” in conjunction 
with the project. However, if B’s policy contains  a contractual liability exclusion, B will have no 
coverage if it is contractually re quired to indemnify A for any prof essional liability claims associated 
with the project.  
Exception for Liability in the Absence of a Contract 
It is common, however, for contractual liability exclus ions to be worded so they provide an exception 
(and thereby provide coverage) for liability that would have attached even in the absence of a 
contract. For example, assume that a construction contract provision required an insured architect to 
indemnify and hold harmless the project owner fo r the insured’s sole negligence (i.e., if the 
architect’s faulty design caused a loss, he would be required to indemnify the project owner for the 
loss). In this instance, coverage would still appl y under most versions of the contractual liability 
exclusion. This is because liability (for the professiona l’s sole negligence) would ordinarily apply (as 
in the above example of the accounting firms, as well), regardless of a contractual provision requiring 
such indemnification.  
Problematic Situations: Acceptance of Liability for the Negligence of Others 
In contrast to the above examples are situations in  which a professional is asked to indemnify another 
party for the results of the other party’s neglig ence. Case-in-point: in order to obtain hospital 
privileges, a surgeon is required to sign a hold ha rmless agreement in which he promises to indemnify 
the hospital if the hospital’s sole negligence causes injury to any of the surgeon’s patients. A possible 
scenario: during an operation, one of the hospital’ s heart monitoring machines shuts down due to a Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
50 lack of maintenance. As a result, the patient is inju red. In this situation, the surgeon would be forced 
to indemnify the hospital for the patient’s injuries, despite the fact that the hospital’s sole negligence 
in maintaining its equipment was the direct cause  of the injury. However, a contractual liability 
exclusion in the surgeon’s PL policy would not cover such indemnification, since, in the absence of 
the hold harmless agreement, the surgeon would not be legally liable to assume the financial 
consequences of the hospital’s sole negligence.    
Modifying the Exclusion 
Given the kind of situation noted in the preceding paragraph, underwriters are sometimes willing to 
modify contractual liability exclusionary wording, either for specific contracts or for all assumptions 
of liability undertaken by an insured. Such modifi cations are especially important if (1) an insured 
agrees to numerous hold harmless agreements as part  of his or her practice and/or (2) an insured 
agrees to a hold harmless arrangement that goes be yond acceptance of liability for his or her sole 
negligence, such as in the exam ple of the surgeon, above.  
Under either of these conditions, insureds should c ontact their underwriters in an effort to seek 
modifications of the contractual liability exclusions within their policies. Generally, underwriters are 
agreeable to such changes, firs t, because these requests allow an insurer the ability to evaluate an 
insured’s individual contractual assumptions of liability and, second, because underwriters usually 
receive additional premium in return.  
Insured versus Insured Exclusion 
Insured versus insured exclusions preclude cove rage for claims made by one insured under a 
professional liability policy, against another. An example of an insu red v. insured claim is one in 
which corporate director “A” sues corporate director “B” because of a bad business proposition that “B” advised the company to pursue, such as urging the acquisition of a subsidiary that eventually produced a significant loss for the company.    
There are several rationales for the insured versus  insured exclusion in professional liability policy 
forms.  
• No intent to cover recoupment for bad bus iness decisions. The insured versus insured 
exclusion originally came into being in th e 1980s when Bank of America began suing a 
number of its loan officers for losses caused by impr udent extensions of credit. In response to 
these lawsuits, the officers then sought coverage under Bank of America’s D&O liability 
policy. However, the bank’s insurer did not intend for the policy to function as an indemnification vehicle for bad business decisions.  (Insurers viewed such claims as affording 
coverage for “business risk,” rather than fo r professional negligence.) So in response, D&O 
insurers began inserting insured versus insure d exclusions within their policy forms, a 
practice which was later extended to other ki nds of professional and management liability 
policy forms.  
• Other, more “specific” insurance coverage av ailable. Since many insureds also purchase 
employment practices liability (EPL) coverage , professional liability insurers feel that 
employment-related claims by one insured agai nst another (e.g., an employee sues his former 
boss for wrongful termination), are more a ppropriately covered by EPL policy forms.  
  Chapter 5—Exclusions 
51 • No coverage intended for “infighting.” Yet another rationale for not covering claims made by 
one insured person against another is that, at times,  such lawsuits are the result of “infighting” 
by one insured against another. For example, in an attempt to force a partner in a law firm to 
resign, the other partners sue him for not bringing in a sufficient number of new clients.  
Despite the rationales for excluding claims by on e insured against another, a number of policies 
contain “exception wording” in one specific situ ation discussed below, which has the effect of 
providing coverage for certain kinds of insured versus insured claims. 
Exception for Performance of Professional Services 
 About half of all PL policies except, and therefore cover, claims by one insured against another, provided the claim involves the actual delivery of  professional services. For example, such an 
exception would be valuable in the event that one  accountant in a CPA firm committed an error when 
doing the tax return of another accountant within th e same firm. Absent such exception wording, such 
a claim would otherwise be precluded by an insured versus insured exclusion. Exceptions of this kind afford coverage for situations involving actual professional errors  and omissions, but appropriately 
eliminate coverage for “infighting,” as noted above  in the scenario involving the law firm that was 
attempting to use a lawsuit as a means of forcing out a nonproductive partner. If the policy does not 
already contain a “professional services” exception, underwriters will usually agree to provide it by 
endorsement for no additional premium charge.  
Prior and Pending Litigation 
Nearly all D&O policy forms, many EPL policies,  and an increasing number of PL forms exclude 
claims arising from litigation that was pending prior to  the inception of the policy. The intent of this 
exclusion is to avoid insuring the so-called burning building, whereby the insurer must cover claims 
from events that were lacking in fortuity and that  sometimes provide the in centive for an insured to 
obtain coverage. This exclusion thus helps the underw riter to avoid what is termed adverse selection. 
(Adverse selection refers to a situation where the insured are much more likely to suffer a loss than are the uninsured. For example, people with chroni c health problems are much more likely to seek 
major medical coverage than are people who do not suffer from such conditions.)  
As an example, a prior and pending litigation exclusion would apply if litigation against a 
corporation—rather than individual directors a nd officers—was pending prior to the inception of a 
D&O policy. If the lawsuit is amended after incep tion of the policy, so that it now names the 
organization’s directors and officers, the prior and pending litigation exclusion would preclude 
coverage for the amended version of the claim.  
Consider the following example. On January 1, 2 008, a borrower whose home has been foreclosed on 
by XYZ Bank files a lawsuit against the bank. The su it alleges that the bank misrepresented the actual 
terms of the loan when the closing papers were signed, because the papers failed to state explicitly 
that after two years, the monthly payment would double. On January 1, 2009, the borrower amends the lawsuit to also name the bank’s directors and o fficers. A week after receiving the suit papers, the 
directors and officers file the claim with their D&O insurer under their January 1, 2009–January 1, 
2010 policy. However, if the bank’s January 1, 2009–January 1, 2010 policy contained a prior and 
pending litigation exclusion, coverage  will be denied, since the claim arose out of a lawsuit that was 
pending prior to the inception of that policy. 
Often, insurers will agree to modify the prior and pending litigation exclusion so that it only applies 
to litigation prior to or pending at the inception da te of the present insurer’s first D&O policy. Given Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
52 this modification, any litigation initiated during th e present insurer’s stream of protection is not 
excluded. This is a reasonably negotiable item a nd can usually be achieved without additional 
premium.  
Exclusions To Coordinate with Other Insurance 
Most professional liability policies exclude covera ge for exposures that are more appropriately 
insured by other types of insurance, such as general liability, automobile liability, and workers 
compensation policies.  
Also in this category are professional liability expo sures that are more properly insurable under other 
types of professional liability policies, such as Em ployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 
1974 responsibilities, which are covered unde r fiduciary liability policy forms.  
These exclusions, which pertain to exposures better covered under other types of policies include the 
following. 
• Employment practices liability claims 
• Bodily injury\property damage liability claims 
• Personal injury claims 
• Claims by and against related\affiliated companies  
• Claims from the delivery of “related” professional services 
• Workers compensation claims 
• Claims involving the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
• Claims involving services provided while not employed by the named insured organization  
• Claims involving motor vehicles, aircraft, and watercraft 
• Pollution claims 
• Claims involving nuclear energy 
Employment Practices 
Coverage for employment practices liability (EPL) claims, namely, allegations of discrimination, 
sexual harassment, wrongful termination, retalia tion, and other workplace torts (e.g., wrongful 
evaluation, constructive discharge , work-related defamation) is precluded by nearly all professional 
liability policy forms.  
The rationale for the exclusion is as follows. Firs t, EPL claims do not normally involve the delivery 
of professional services. Rather, they emanate from the employment process. Second, recent years 
have witnessed rapid growth of a significant mark et for EPL coverage. More than 50 insurers, as well 
as the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO), ha ve developed specialized policy forms expressly 
designed to cover this exposure.  
It should be mentioned, however, that D&O insurers are generally willing to provide EPL coverage, 
via an endorsement to their policies, most often for a premium charge equal to an additional 10 
percent of the basic policy. There are, however, a number of drawbacks to this approach, including 
the fact that: (1) EPL claims can deplete limits otherwise available for covering traditional D&O 
claims; (2) neither the corporate entity nor non-director/officer employees are insureds under such Chapter 5—Exclusions 
53 endorsements; and (3) the scope of covered employment perils is much narrower, compared to stand-
alone EPL policies.  
Bodily Injury/Property Damage 
Most professional liability policies exclude coverage for bodily injury  and property da mage liability, 
because coverage for incidents of this kind (e.g., slip-and-fall claims in a professional’s office) are 
more properly the subject 
BI/PD Exclusions Do Not Appear  in Certain PL Policy Forms 
It should be recognized, however, that policies written for certain kinds of professionals, notably 
physicians and architects and engineers, do not c ontain exclusions for bodily injury and property 
damage because their professional functions frequently  result in bodily injury and property damage. 
Moreover, since GGL policy forms routinely exclude BI and PD claims arising from professional acts 
against doctors and architects and engineers, to al so exclude such claims under PL policies would not 
be feasible. 
“Arising Out of, Related to, in any Way In volving” versus “For” Wording of BI/PD 
Exclusion 
There are two distinct ways in which the BI/PD exclusion is worded in PL policy forms and the 
difference is significant. Under some policies, th ere is an exclusion “for” claims involving bodily 
injury or property damage. In contrast, other polic ies exclude coverage for claims “arising out of, 
related to, or in any way involving” bodily injury or property damage.   
The following scenario illustrates wh y, from an insured’s standpoint, the “for” bodily injury/property 
damage version of this exclusion is preferable to the “arising out of” version of the BI/PD exclusion. 
The XYZ Pharmaceutical Company manufactures a drug for high blood pressure. After being on the 
market for a year, the drug is found to cause can cer. Upon learning of this problem, the company 
immediately takes the drug off the market. Nevert heless, following the withdrawal, the company is 
besieged with lawsuits alleging that the drug caused cancer. As a result of the lawsuits, shares of the 
firm’s stock plummet, and shareholder class action claims against the company’s directors and officers follow. Assume that the company’s D&O policy was written with an exclusion precluding claims “arising out of, related to, or in any way involving” bodily injury or property damage. Under 
these circumstances, the insurer could deny covera ge for the shareholder class action claims on the 
basis that the stock price drop arose from, was related to, and involved the bodily injury claims filed by users of the insured’s drug.  
Conversely, had the exclusion been written to ex clude coverage “for” bodily injury and property 
damage, the insurer would be hard-pressed to deny  coverage for the securities class action claims 
under this scenario because the claims did not arise directly from the claimants’ allegations of bodily 
injury; rather, they emanated from a drop in the drug manufacturer’s stock price. The effect of this 
difference is that “for” wording can only be used to deny coverage for direct BI/PD claims, whereas 
“arising out of, related to, in any way involving” wording can be used to deny coverage for the consequences of BI/PD; which, in this scenar io, was the securities class action claim against the 
company’s directors and officers. 
If possible, a policy containing a BI/PD exclusion using “arising out of, related to, in any way 
involving” wording should be modified and replaced  with the much more insured-friendly “for” 
version of this exclusion. Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
54 Personal Injury 
Claims involving personal injury caused by libel, sla nder, false arrest, invasion of privacy, malicious 
prosecution, and other standard personal injury perils are excluded by many professional liability 
policies. (Personal injury is a category of harm ot her than bodily injury, property damage, or financial 
injury.) This is because CGL forms normally cove r such exposures. However, given the presence of 
professional liability exclusions in CGL policies, personal injury coverage may not always be 
available, which could cause a problem for certain types of professionals.  
Personal Injury Coverage within PL  Forms for Certain Professions 
Despite the fact that the vast majority of PL po licies contain personal injury exclusions, policies 
written for certain professions, most often attorney s and sometimes accountants, provide coverage for 
a number of personal injury perils, such as libel, slander, false arrest, malicious prosecution, and 
invasion of privacy.  This is necessary because the nature of such work frequently creates personal 
injury exposures.  
For example, an attorney brings a case against a defendant. However, the case is dismissed on a 
summary judgment basis and in her decision, the judge states that the case was “completely without 
merit.” As a result, the defendant brings a claim against the attorney for malicious prosecution.  
Coverage for the claim would be available under the attorney’s PL policy, provided malicious 
prosecution is included within the policy’s definition of “personal injury,” which is normally be the 
case.  
Related/Affiliated Entities 
Related/affiliated entity exclusions are common because frequently, professionals have financial 
interests in other, related businesses, in addition to their basic professional practice. For example, it is 
not uncommon for physicians to also own physical therapy clinics or diagnostic testing labs. 
Exclusion of Claims Against Related Entities 
First, these exclusions eliminate coverage for clai ms made against related entities that are not named 
insureds. This is because such firms should either  be named on the insured’s policy or they should 
maintain their own professional liability policy. For example, a physician’s professional liability 
policy would exclude coverage for claims made agains t the physical therapy clinic that she owns (but 
which is not identified in her PL policy). This is  because the clinic should either have a separate 
policy covering it or should be insured under the physician’s professional liability policy. 
Exclusion of Claims by Related Entities 
Second, related/affiliated entity ex clusions also preclude coverage for situations where a claim is 
made by a related or controlled en tity against the insured. For exampl e, an insurance broker also owns 
an independent claims adjusting firm. The adjus ting firm brings a claim against the brokerage 
alleging that the broker furnished its adjuster with  incorrect coverage information about one of the 
brokerage’s clients. As a result, the adjuster wrot e a check for a loss that was not covered. This, in 
turn, caused the insurer th e adjuster was representing, to sue th e adjusting firm for paying a $50,000 
claim not covered by the policy issued by the insure r. The rationale for the exclusion of claims by 
related entities (against the insured) is that su ch claims are sometimes (although not always) of a 
collusive nature, whereby an insured attempts to  profit by suing his or her own company.  Chapter 5—Exclusions 
55 Related/Affiliated Entity Exclus ions: The Ownership Threshold 
At times, the extent to which a professional has an ownership interest in another firm is not as clear-
cut, as in the examples noted above. Specifically, in these examples, it was assumed that the doctor 
had a 100 percent ownership in the physical therap y clinic. Likewise, in the second example, it is 
assumed that the insurance brokerage was the sole ow ner of the independent adjusting firm. However, 
there are many situations in which an insured pr ofessional may not be the sole owner of a related 
entity and, in fact, may be a minority owner. Accordingly, in writing the related/affiliated entities 
exclusion, insurers generally stipulate some “thr eshold” percentage, below which the exclusion does 
not apply. Typically, this threshold is in the range  of 10 percent to 25 percent, whereby the exclusion 
only applies if the insured’s ownership interest exc eeds the policy’s stated threshold percentage. From 
the insured’s standpoint, the higher the threshold, the better. If, for example, a policy is written with a 
10 percent threshold, a 15 percent ownership stake would bar coverage. On the other hand, if the 
policy contained a 25 percent threshold, a 15 percen t ownership interest would not preclude coverage 
in a claim situation involving a related/affiliated entity. 
Claims from the Delivery of Related Professional Services 
A number of professional liability policies contain excl usions for professional services that are related 
to but different from the kinds of services primarily performed by the insured. For example, real estate brokers’ professional liability policy forms usually exclude coverage for lawyers’ professional liability exposures. This is because a number of real  estate operations, such as title closings, require 
the services of an attorney and real estate brokers sometimes attempt to provide such services. In effect, the intent of this exclusion is to protect the insurer from having to cover exposures that are 
related to but different from—and usually pose high er potential loss severity—than those intended to 
be covered by the policy.  
Another example: insurance agents and brokers E&O policy forms usually contain exclusions for 
coverage of claims involving actuarial services. Such work, while related to the selling of insurance, 
is still fundamentally different, and thus, insurers typically exclude coverage for actuarial services in 
policy forms written to cover agents and brokers.  (In surers will, however, sometimes offer to provide 
such coverage, but in return for additional premium.) 
Workers Compensation 
Virtually all professional liability policies exclude coverage for any type of obligation under workers 
compensation, disability, unemployment, or similar laws. Alternatively, some policies preclude coverage for these types of exposures by excluding claims involving bodily injury or sickness of any employee of the insured. The rationale for the workers compensation exclusion is that such exposures 
should be covered under workers compensation policies.  
ERISA Responsibilities 
Coverage for claims involving the administration of  pension and employee benefit plans are excluded 
under virtually all professional liability policies, except, of course, fiduciary liability policies—whose 
essential purpose is to cover claims arising from such exposures.  
In some cases, so-called ERISA exclusions are worded so that they specifically preclude coverage for 
insured professionals’ responsibilities as enumerated by the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA) of 1974 or by similar laws. The rationa le for this exclusion is that such exposures are 
insurable under separate fiduciary liability policies.  Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
56 Services Not on Behalf of the Named Insured Organization 
Most professional liability policies exclude covera ge for claims arising from activities that are 
performed for entities other than the named insured organization. The wording of such exclusions 
most often applies to: (1) outside dir ectorships and (2) moonlighting activities. 
Outside Directorships 
The exclusion has the effect of precluding coverage  for liabilities incurred in conjunction with serving 
on the boards of non-profit organizations and public entities.  The rationale for the exclusion is that an 
insured’s work on behalf of such groups should be covered separately by the organization on whose 
board the professional is serving.  
Exclusion of “Moonlighting Activities” 
Another key purpose of this exclusion is to elim inate coverage for moonlighting activities, such as 
when an accountant, employed by a CPA firm, moonlights as a tax preparer or when a police officer performs off-duty work as a security guard. Again, the rationale for this exclusion is that the entity on whose behalf the professional is performing services, should provide professional liability coverage.  
Motor Vehicles, Aircraft, Watercraft 
Liability arising out of automobiles, watercraft, or aircraft or any other types of motor vehicles is 
excluded by virtually all professional liability coverages, because these exposures can be separately insured. 
Pollution 
Virtually all PL and ML policies exclude coverage for claims involving pollution. This is because few 
ML and PL risks (other than medical facilities and ar chitects and engineers) actually generate direct 
exposures to pollution. 
Nuclear Energy 
Most PL and ML forms contain broad form nuclear en ergy exclusions. Their intent is similar to the 
rationale underlying pollution exclusions  discussed in the above paragraph.  
Exclusions for Specialized Exposures 
To compel disclosure of particularly hazardous ac tivities in which insureds engage, some insurers’ 
policies contain exclusions of exposures they are ot herwise willing to cover. However, for additional 
premium these exclusions can be removed. (Thi s is sometimes referred to as “buying back” the 
coverage by removing the exclusion.) A number of professions have specialized practices that 
generate greater-than-average exposures to cl aims. Notable examples include the following. 
• Cosmetic surgery and bariatric surgery (physicians)  
• Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) work (attorneys)  
• Investment consulting (accountants)  
• Managing general agency (MGA) operations (insurance agents)  
• Soil testing (engineers)  Chapter 5—Exclusions 
57 Although coverage for these kinds of activities is sometimes excluded by standard policies written for 
these professions, such restrictions can frequently be removed or modified, in return for the payment 
of additional premium. By making such exclusions  a part of the standard policy forms written for 
professionals not engaged in these more hazardous specialties, the insurer, in effect, imposes a 
requirement that it be notified should the hazardous ac tivity ever be undertaken. It may then charge an 
additional premium to cover the increased exposure. 
Concluding Thoughts Regarding PL and ML Exclusionary 
Language 
While all portions of professional lia bility policies are important, the exclusions sections merit careful 
study. Not only can exclusions significantly restrict  the scope of coverage, but, as has been apparent 
from the foregoing discussion, the wording of the same  exclusion can vary considerably from insurer 
to insurer. Finally, because they are often added by endorsement rather than being included within the 
standard policy form itself, exclusions are especially meaningful because when such provisions 
conflict with the terms of the regular policy, courts  of law generally interp ret exclusions added by 
endorsement as overriding standard policy provisions.

agreement with no contingencies after real estate agent Sam Sales assured Prudence that her 
credit rating would qualify her for an affordable 30-year mortgage. Prudence then learns that 
an affordable 30-year mortgage simply does not exist in the current market. She sues Sam 
Sales seeking to enforce his promise. Sam tu rns the claim over to his professional liability 
insurer. The insurer will do all of the following except: 
a. The insurer will provide an affordab le 30-year mortgage for Prudence. 
b. The insurer will pay damages equivalent to the financial value of Prudence’s loss.  
c. The insurer will pay Sam Sales’ defense costs. 
d. The insurer will not provide the actual relief Prudence seeks. 
4. Dr. Lamb has admitting privileges at several different hospitals.  She should ask an 
underwriter to modify the contractual liability exclusion in her medical professional liability 
policy under the all of the following conditions, except in a situation where:  
a. she agrees to a hold harmless arrangement th at goes beyond acceptance of liability for her 
sole negligence. 
b. she is willing to pay a higher premium  to modify the exclusion. 
c. she signs numerous hold harmless agr eements as part of her practice. 
d. the exclusion contains an exception for liab ility that would apply in the absence of a

lawyers, accountants, real estate brokers, and in surance agents; surgeons’ work typically does not 
usually requires them to notarize documents. 
3. a. It is literally impossible to provide relief that does not exist. 
4. d. This common exception to contractual liability exclusions operates in Dr. Lamb’s favor.  
5. c. There is little if any potential overlap between a liability insurance policy and one providing life 
insurance coverage.

Coordinating ML and PL Policies with CGL Coverage 
This section will address EL/PL coverage coordination. More specifically, it will discuss how to 
coordinate EL/PL policies with commerc ial general liability (CGL) policies. 
When a CGL policy is written for a professional or professional organization, the intent is to insure 
the individual’s or organization’s liability exposures that are not of a purely professional nature. For 
example, an injury sustained by an  insurance agent’s client  when the client slips and falls in the lobby 
of the agent’s office should clearly be covered by th e CGL policy. On the other hand, if the insurance 
agent’s failure to arrange appropr iate coverage, as requested by a client, produces an uncovered loss, 
the client’s claim would be addressed by the insura nce agent’s professional liability insurance policy. 
A Potential Coverage Gap 
Most of the time, the line of demarcation be tween what distinguishes a professional from a 
nonprofessional act, is usually clear-cut.  However, there is one significant “grey area” that has the 
potential to create a potential coverage gap. Th is gap between PL/EL policies and CGL policies 
results when there is no bodily injury liability cove rage for claims arising out of the performance of 
professional services. This can happen when there is  a (1) a BI/PD exclusion in the EL/PL policy and 
(2) a professional liability exclusion in the CGL policy. The following claim scenarios provide 
examples of how this gap coul d cause a coverage problem.  
There are several ways to afford coverage under these circumstances. First, the professional liability exclusion can be removed from the professional’s CG L policy. Second, the bodily injury exclusion 
can be deleted from the professional liability polic y. Unfortunately, few PL or CGL insurers will 
agree to such changes. 
Consolidating Coverage with One Insurer 
Third, the gap can be closed by having both the CGL and professional liability policies written by the 
same insurer. If this were arranged, it would be difficult for the insurer to assert that the claim is 
excluded under both types of policies. However, si nce the market for professional liability insurance 
coverage is limited, placing both PL and CGL coverage with the same insurer is not usually possible 
to achieve. This is because most of the insurers writing professional liability insurance are not also in 
the business of offering general liability coverage. For this reason, it is often impossible to purchase general and professional liability in surance from the same insurer. 
 Common Features of Professional a nd Management Liability Policy Forms 
60 Exhibit 6.1 
Bodily Injury and Property Damage Coverage Gaps Between CGL And PL/EL 
Policies 
• An accountant’s client suffers a nervous breakdown after learning that investments 
suggested by the accountant have deteriorated, resulting in a significant financial loss. A 
claim of this kind could conceivably be excluded by both policies—from the CGL because 
of a professional liability exclusion, and from a professional liability policy because of a 
bodily injury exclusion.  
• A software company’s computer assisted des ign (CAD) program contains an error that 
leads to a design defect in a piece of medical equipment. The defect causes it to malfunction during treatment, and results in bodily  injury to a patient. Again, a claim of 
this type could be excluded from both a CGL and a professional lia bility policy, for the 
reasons noted in the previous example.  
• False statements, based on legal research by an attorney, are printed in a periodical. 
They cause the person about whom they are made to suffer such emotional trauma that the individual commits suicide. A bodily injury exclusion in a lawyer’s professional liability 
policy would exclude coverage, as would a professional liability exclusion in a CGL 
policy. 
CGL Professional Liability Coverage Endorsements 
A final way to eliminate these types of coverage  gaps is to purchase a PL endorsement to a CGL 
policy form. Examples of two professions for wh ich ISO has promulgated standard coverage 
endorsements are Optical and Hearing Aid Establishments (CG 22 65) and Druggists (CG 22 69). 
Purchasing both a CGL policy as well as these endorseme nts will prevent the kinds of coverage gaps 
noted above. Unfortunately, these are the only such endorsements that ISO offers. 
Eliminating BI/PD Coverage Gaps 
The most effective approach to closing this potential gap, and one that will apply to nearly all types of 
professions, is to obtain a professional liability policy that is written with a modified bodily injury 
exclusion. Such an exclusion provides an excepti on (and thus provides coverage) for claims that 
result solely out of professional services. Exclusions of this kind preclude coverage for bodily injury 
that is unrelated to an insured’s delivery of professi onal services, which is appropriate. However, they 
afford coverage when, as in the scenarios discussed previously in Exhi bit 6.1, bodily injury results 
from a purely professional act, error, or omission. Th e modified wording noted below in Exhibit 6.2 
should be requested, if it is not already included w ithin an insured’s professional liability policy form. 
 
Exhibit 6.2 
Modified Bodily Injury Exclusionary Wording 
Coverage under this policy does not apply to any Cl aim for “bodily injury” “personal injury,” or 
“property damage”, unless the claim results solely from professio nal services performed by the 
“insured.” 
 
 Chapter 6—Coordinating ML and PL  Policies with CGL Coverage 
61 Chapter 6 Review Questions  
1. A common gap between professional liability and general liability policies can sometimes be 
covered in any of the following ways, except: 
a. Purchase both policies from the same insurer. 
b. Purchase gap coverage. 
c. Remove the bodily injury exclusion from the professional liability policy. 
d. Remove the professional liability exclus ion from the general liability policy. 
2. Both general liability and professional liab ility policies written to cover an insured 
professional often exclude coverage for bodily inju ry claims. The most effective way to close 
this potential coverage gap is for the general liability policy to be written so that it excludes 
all claims: 
a. resulting from the insured’s professional services and to add a modified BI exclusion to 
the insured’s professional liability policy. 
b. entirely unrelated to nonprofessional services. 
c. resulting solely because of the insured’s negligence. 
d. from non-clients 
 
    
 
    
Answers to Chapter 6 Review Questions 
1. b. Gap coverage generally refers to auto lending or leasing arrangements that might involve a gap 
between the vehicle’s insurable value and the amount outstanding on the loan or lease contract. 
2. a. The most effective way to close the potential coverage gap for BI claims between general liability 
and professional liability policies, is for the professional liability policy to (1) exclude all claims 
resulting from the insured’s professional services and (2) to add a modified BI exclusion to the insured’s professional liability policy. A modified  BI exclusion precludes coverage for claims 
unrelated to professional services (which is the in tent of the policy), yet does cover BI claims when 
they result solely from a professional act, which is also appropriate.
