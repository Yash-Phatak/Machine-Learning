1Chapter 1
Liability Risks and Insurance Overview
2Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn how to…
1. Identify the parties involved in oil and gas exploration and recognize their
legal and contractual relationships with one another.
2. Identify the major categories of insurable liability risk faced by energy
industry companies.
3. Identify the types of protection that general liability insurance provides.
4. Recognize the types of losses addressed by each of the CGL policy’s
coverages.
5. Define various terms used in the CGL and the energy industry; accurately
associate terms used in the CGL and in the energy industry with their
appropriate meanings.
6. Identify the elements of a CGL policy and recognize what provisions are
found in each of the elements.
7. Outline a process for determining whether a given insurance policy
covers a particular loss.
General liability insurance  provides protection  against two types of financial loss arising out of a lawsuit 
against the company.  First, it covers damages awarded to a third party because of injury or damage for 
which the insured is legally responsible,  including  loss of use of property claims. In addition,  it covers the 
cost of defending  the insured against the charges alleged in the suit, including  attorney fees, investigation  
costs, and other legal expenses.  Defense costs can amount to huge sums even when the insured is cleared 
of any legal liability for damages.  Together,  the indemnity  (payment  of damages on the insured’s behalf) 
and defense (payment  of legal expenses)  obligations  comprise the insurer’s key contractual  promises to 
the insured.Liability loss exposures  arise out of legal wrongs. The  three broad classes of legal wrongs are  crime, 
breach of contract,  and tort, each being addressed  by a different branch of the law. General liability 
insurance  concerns itself with tort liability. Tort law protects the rights of individuals  from civil wrongs 
and generally provides monetary  remedies to tort victims. In some instances,  a criminal act may give rise 
to civil as well as criminal liability, with monetary  awards as remedies.  For example,  while fraud is 
punishable  under criminal law, the individual  victims may also be permitted  to sue for monetary  damages, 
such as restitution  of losses and even non-economic  damages such as punitive damages or emotional  
distress. Whether liabilities involving  criminal activities such as negligent supervision  are covered by 
general liability insurance  often comes down to whether the insured had knowledge  of the criminal actions 
and intent.
In addition  to common law, contractual  agreements  also create legal duties, such as an agreement  to 
perform in a certain manner, to complete a project in a specified length of time, to deliver a quality 
product, or to assume responsibility  for liabilities  that legally fall on another contracting  party. Any 
violation or breach of a contractual  agreement  is a civil (as opposed to a criminal) wrong, with  an award 
of monetary  damages as a potential remedy. Many breach of contract claims are confined to allegations  of 
financial or business  loss that are not of a type that are covered under a general liability policy. For 
example, liability based on the failure to perform the contracted  work is usually not insurable.  Other 
contractual  liabilities—including  the assumption  of the other party’s legal liability to a third person or 
organization—are  often covered.
Introduction:  The Unique Nature of Oil and Gas Operations
It is important  to understand  the unique nature of oil and gas operations,  since it affects the way general 
liability insurance  responds to loss exposures.  Therefore,  we begin this course with a brief discussion  of 
some significant  features present in the energy industry that have an impact on risk allocation  and 
coverage under general liability insurance.  As an initial matter, oil and gas operations  present the
3possibility
of
catastrophic
loss,
and
the
risk
profile
of
the
energy
industry
is
measured
by
severity,
not 
frequency.
The
British
Petroleum
(BP)
oil
spill
provides
a
good
example
of
the
industry’s
risk
profile.
BP 
was
the
operator
of
the
Deepwater
Horizon
rig
and
the
contractor,
Transocean,
was
drilling
for
oil
at
the 
Macondo
exploratory
well
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico.
On
April
10,
2010,
high-pressure
methane
gas
from
the 
Macondo
well
expanded
into
the
drilling
riser
and
rose
into
the
drilling
rig,
where
it
ignited
and
exploded, 
engulfing
the
drilling
platform.
The
explosion
resulted
in
11
fatalities
and
17
injuries
to
drilling
crew 
members. 
The
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
rig
sank
36
hours
after
the
explosion,
and
a
sea-floor
oil
gusher
(blowout) 
flowed
for
87
days,
resulting
in
the
largest
marine
oil
spill
in
the
history
of
the
petroleum
industry.
205.8 
million
gallons
of
oil
leaked
from
the
Macondo
well
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico.
To
put
this
in
perspective, 
this
figure
represents
about
half
of
the
amount
of
oil
the
U.S.
imports
each
day.
By
comparison,
10.8 
million
gallons
of
oil
spilled
from
the
Exxon
Valdez
in
1989.
It
is
estimated
that
62,000
barrels
of
oil 
leaked
each
day
when
the
wellhead
first
broke,
a
figure
that
is
approximately
equal
to
the
amount
of
oil 
consumed
daily
in
the
state
of
Delaware.
665
miles
of
coastline
were
contaminated
by
oil.
16,000
total 
miles
of
coastline
have
been
affected
by
the
spill,
including
the
coasts
of
Texas,
Louisiana,
Mississippi, 
Alabama,
and
Florida.
Of
Louisiana’s
400
miles
of
coast,
approximately
125
miles
have
been
polluted
by 
the
oil
spill.
Over
8,000
animals,
such
as
birds,
turtles,
marine
mammals,
fish,
and
crustaceans,
many
of 
which
were
endangered
species,
were
reported
dead
just
6
months
after
the
spill.
These
are
sobering
facts 
that
illustrate
the
catastrophic
loss
that
can
result
from
oil
and
gas
operations. 
Oil
and
gas
operations
involve
multiple
employers,
multiple
employees,
and
expensive
property,
usually 
located
at
a
common
job
site.
For
example,
the
process
of
drilling
a
well
involves
several
parties
such
as 
the
operator,
the
drilling
contractor,
the
mud
logging
company,
the
well
service
contractor,
as
well
as 
other
consultants
and
contractors.
These
parties
use
contracts
to
define
their
obligations.
Contracts
are 
also
used
to
allocate
the
high
degree
of
risk
associated
with
oil
and
gas
operations.
Mineral
leases,
leases 
for
equipment,
drilling
contracts,
master
service
agreements,
joint
operating
agreements,
surface
use 
agreements,
well
site
consulting
agreements,
work
orders
and
credit
agreements,
and
purchase
and
sale 
agreements
contain
indemnity
provisions
which
require
one
of
the
parties
(the
indemnitor)
to
indemnify 
the
other
party
(the
indemnitee).
These
contracts
also
require
insurance
coverage
to
support
the
indemnity 
obligations.
Consequently,
oil
and
gas
operations
involve
a
high
degree
of
contractual
liability
that
is
not 
always
present
in
other
industries. 
Indemnity
provisions
are
discussed
in
greater
detail
later
in
this
course.
Nevertheless,
it
is
worth 
mentioning
that
risk
allocation
in
oil
and
gas
operations
works
differently
than
risk
allocation
in
other 
industries.
Indemnity
provisions
in
many
industries,
such
as
construction,
seek
to
allocate
risk
from
an 
upstream
party
(e.g.,
the
project
owner)
to
a
downstream
party
(e.g.,
the
general
contractor,
who,
in
turn, 
allocates
the
risk
downstream
to
its
subcontractors).
When
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arises
in
oil 
and
gas
operations,
it
is
often
the
result
of
a
confluence
of
errors
committed
by
multiple
people,
multiple 
companies,
or
both,
and
it
is
often
factually
or
scientifically
difficult
to
determine
who
was
to
blame
and 
in
what
proportions.
As
a
result,
under
certain
oil
and
gas
contracts,
risk
is
typically
allocated
based
on 
“ownership”
of
personnel
and
property,
as
opposed
to
fault.
However,
allocation
of
risk
does
not
always 
follow
ownership
of
property.
In
some
cases,
the
operator
contractually
assumes
liability
for
property
that 
it
does
not
own.
For
example,
the
downstream
oil
and
gas
contractor
typically
does
not
hold
responsibility 
for
well
control.
In
most
instances
the
operator
(upstream)
holds
that
responsibility
unless
it
is
excepted
in 
the
daywork
or
footage
setting
or
in
the
turnkey
setting,
and
then
only
when
the
turnkey
rate
is
being 
used.
So
the
operator
is
responsible
for
coordination
of
the
control
of
well
exposure
even
after
well 
completion
and
production.
Under
some
contracts,
an
operator
or
drilling
contractor,
may
allocate
risk
to 
a
downstream
party
such
as
a
subcontractor.
In
sum,
contractually
assumed
liabilities
in
energy
industry 
contracts
do
not
always
follow
the
upstream
to
downstream
pattern
found
in
construction
and
other 
contracts. 
Finally,
insurance
plays
a
key
role
in
oil
and
gas
risk
allocation
programs,
not
only
to
support
a
party’s 
indemnity
obligations,
but
also
because
of
the
high
degree
of
risk
inherent
in
oil
and
gas
operations.
Some 
of
the
most
important
insurance
protections
that
general
liability
insurance
provides
to
energy
industry 
companies
include
waivers
of
subrogation,
additional
insured
endorsements,
and
ensuring
that
coverage
4for
additional
insureds
is
“primary
and
noncontributory.”
These
protections
are
discussed
in
greater
detail 
in
this
course.
That
is
not
to
imply,
however,
that
other
portions
of
general
liability
insurance
are 
immaterial
to
energy
industry
liability
exposures.
Although
oil
and
gas
operations
have
a
high
degree
of 
risk,
general
liability
insurance
plays
an
important
role
in
an
energy
industry
company’s
risk
management 
program. 
Energy
Industry
Liability
Exposures
The
insurance
industry
broadly
categorizes
general
liability
loss
exposures
into
four
groups.
Premises
and 
operations
liability
encompasses
liability
arising
out
of
conditions
in
and
around
the
insured’s
premises
as 
well
as
its
current
on
and
off
premises
business
operations.
Products
and
completed
operations
liability 
refers
to
just
that—liability
arising
out
of
the
insured’s
products
or
its
completed
work.
This 
contemporaneous
grouping
of
exposures—those
that
are
based
on
current
activities
and
generally
in
close 
proximity
to
the
insured
and
those
that
arise
out
of
past
activities
and
are
remote
in
both
time
and
distance 
from
the
insured—reflects
the
different
risks
and
challenges
these
exposures
present
for
insurers. 
Contractual
liability
involves
the
voluntary
assumption
of
obligations
that
do
not
exist
under
common 
law,
and
independent
contractor
liability
describes
liability
imposed
upon
the
person
who
hires
an 
independent
contractor
to
perform
work
on
its
behalf.
Energy
industry
professionals
face
significant 
liability
exposures
in
each
of
these
four
categories. 
Premises
and
Operations
Risks
Premises
and
operational
risks
in
the
energy
industry
are
significant
and
include
fire,
explosions, 
blowouts,
pipe
failure,
cratering,
sour
gas
releases,
abnormally
pressured
formations,
and
environmental 
hazards
such
as
oil
spills,
gas
leaks,
ruptures
and
discharges
of
toxic
gasses.
These
are
just
a
few
of
the 
liability
exposures
that
energy
industry
companies
face
on
every
project
they
undertake
and
these 
exposures
could
result
in
injury
or
loss
of
life
of
employees
and
nonemployees.
These
also
may
cause 
severe
damage
to,
or
destruction
of
property,
equipment,
and
natural
resources,
pollution
or
other 
environmental
damage,
as
well
as
suspension
of
operations
resulting
in
business
interruption
costs.
When 
these
damages
can
be
attributed
to
an
energy
industry
company’s
negligence,
or
another
source
of
legal 
liability,
the
energy
industry
company
is
responsible
for
damages
that
occur.
(In
most
instances,
injuries 
to
employees
do
not
present
general
liability
exposures
because
of
the
exclusive
remedy
of
workers 
compensation.
Where
exclusive
remedy
cannot
be
circumvented,
the
workers
compensation
and 
employers
liability
policy
will
apply,
not
the
general
liability
policy.)
In
some
cases,
the
energy
industry 
company
may
be
liable
when
someone
else’s
negligence
was
the
cause
of
the
loss—such
as
when
it
has 
contractually
agreed
to
assume
another
party’s
liability
for
such
losses. 
Products
and
Completed
Operations
Risks
Some
energy
industry
companies
may
have
product
liability
exposures,
especially
if
they
are
part
of
the 
downstream
process,
such
as
oil
refineries
who
convert
crude
oil
into
other
products
and
then
sell
those 
products
to
customers
or
if
a
party
fabricates
materials
for
use
in
the
project,
but
the
completed
operations 
exposure
is
by
far
the
greater
risk.
For
example,
pipes
constructed
by
a
pipeline
operator
could
fail
several 
years
after
they
were
built,
resulting
in
seepage
of
oil
onto
land
adjacent
to
the
pipes
that
takes
place
over 
several
years.
Similarly,
a
gas
leak
might
occur
without
immediately
being
detected,
resulting
in
property 
damage
years
later.
A
refinery’s
operations
might
result
in
seepage
of
oil
on
to
the
refinery
ground
and 
adjacent
land
for
several
years
before
being
detected.
Hydraulic
fracturing
(fracking)
might
result
in 
groundwater
contamination
over
a
period
of
years
or
might
even
result
in
natural
resource
damage
by 
using
up
the
surrounding
groundwater
supply.
In
other
words,
some
completed
operations
exposures 
involve
progressive
damage
that
takes
years
to
develop
to
the
point
of
being
noticed.
These
long-tail 
liabilities
are
difficult
to
estimate
and
much
more
difficult
to
investigate
and
determine
the
cause
of
the 
loss.
Further,
with
respect
to
progressive
injury
or
damage,
issues
often
arise
over
when
the
actual
injury 
or
damage
occurred. 
Contractual
Liabilities
Contractual
relationships
are
at
the
heart
of
oil
and
gas
exploration,
production,
and
distribution
activities
5because
these
activities
are
large
in
scale,
expensive,
complex,
and
involve
numerous
entities.
As 
previously
noted,
the
energy
industry
uses
contracts
as
a
way
to
designate
responsibilities
and
allocate 
liabilities.
For
example,
an
operator
is
the
party
who
has
the
legal
right,
either
by
ownership
or
by
virtue 
of
a
mineral
lease,
a
type
of
contract,
to
produce
oil
and
gas
from
a
particular
well.
Oil
and
gas 
exploration
and
production
is
usually
not
conducted
by
a
single
entity.
Instead,
joint
ventures
are
formed 
to
help
mitigate
the
risks
associated
with
exploration
and
production
and
to
share
the
costs
for
exploration 
and
production
activities.
The
operator
has
responsibility
for
the
day
to
day
management
(“working 
interest”)
of
the
drilling
project
whereas
the
other
joint
venturers
own
a
“nonoperating
working
interest” 
in
the
mineral
lease,
which
means
they
are
responsible
for
a
portion
of
the
ongoing
costs
associated
with 
the
venture,
but
do
not
participate
in
the
day
to
day
management
of
the
drilling
project.
Parties
to
a 
contract
enter
into
a
joint
operating
agreement
(JOA),
a
type
of
contract
that
sets
forth
the
duties
and 
obligations
of
both
the
operator
and
nonoperating
working
interest
owners. 
Oil
and
gas
wells
are
typically
drilled
by
a
drilling
contractor,
a
company
that
owns
the
drilling
rig
and 
maintains
employees
to
drill
oil
and
gas
wells.
The
oil
operator
and
drilling
contractor
enter
into
a
drilling 
contract,
and
depending
on
the
terms
of
that
contract,
either
the
operator
or
the
drilling
contractor
or
both 
parties
will
enter
into
contracts
with
various
other
companies
for
services,
supplies,
and
equipment 
needed
to
complete
the
drilling
project.
For
example,
an
operator
may
hire
a
drilling
fluids
engineer
to 
monitor
drilling
fluids
to
maintain
hydrostatic
pressure
in
the
borehole.
A
mud
logger
may
be
hired
to 
create
a
detailed
record
of
a
borehole
by
examining
the
cuttings
of
rock
brought
to
the
surface
by
the 
drilling
mud.
An
illustration
of
some
of
the
key
players
in
oil
and
gas
drilling
operations
is
found
in 
Exhibit
1.1,
which
outlines
some
of
the
main
contractual
relationships
involved
in
the
BP
oil
spill. 
6Exhibit 1.1
Contractual Relationships in Connection with the BP Oil Spill
Company Role
Transocean Owner of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and
the drilling contractor. Transocean leased the rig
to BP. The lease agreement required
Transocean to manage and operate the
Deepwater Horizon on behalf of BP, including
providing the drilling personnel.
BP Operator of the Macondo oil well on behalf of its
joint venture partners. Owner of a 65% interest in
the Macondo mineral lease.
Anadarko E&P Company A U.S. oil and gas exploration company that was
a nonoperating working interest owner of the
Macondo well. Anadarko E&P Company owned a
22.5% interest in the Macondo mineral lease.
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation A U.S. oil and gas exploration company that was
a nonoperating working interest owner of the
Macondo well. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
owned a 2.5% interest in the Macondo mineral
lease
MOEX Offshore 2007 A Japanese oil exploration firm that was a
nonoperating working interest owner of the
Macondo well. MOEX Offshore 2007 owned a
10% interest in the Macondo mineral lease.
Halliburton Halliburton was BP’s cement contractor at the
Macondo well, and provided cement planning,
products, and services at the site.
Cameron A Texas-based manufacturer of oil and gas
pressure control equipment. Cameron
manufactured the Deepwater Horizon’s blowout
preventer.
MI-SWACO A worldwide supplier of drilling supplies and
services. MI-SWACO developed the mud
program and provided drilling mud and personnel
to operate the Deepwater Horizon rig’s mud
system.
Schlumberger An oilfield service provider that provided well
logging services for the Macondo well.
Sperry Drilling (Sperry-Sun) A subsidiary of Halliburton that equipped the
Deepwater Horizon with Sperry data sensors and
Sperry mudloggers to monitor and evaluate well
condition data.
Weatherford International A Swiss-based multinational oilfield service and
technology company that provided the casing,
casing centralizers, and float conversion
equipment used on the Deepwater Horizon.
7Exhibit 1.1 demonstrates  the prevalent nature of contracts  in oil and gas operations.  As expected,  
numerous  contractual  obligations  arise under these contracts.  For example,  under a drilling contract, 
drilling contractors  generally agree to perform the work in accordance  with the specifications  and industry 
standards,  to perform the work in a workmanlike  manner, and to complete the work by an  agreed-upon  
date. Drilling contractors  also agree to pay their suppliers and subcontractors  (to avoid taxes and liens on 
the mineral property),  and in some cases, to perform the contracted  work for an agreed price. The 
liabilities that are created by these contractual  obligations  are considered  the normal risks of doing 
business as a drilling contractor  in the energy industry.
An additional  type of contractual  liability exposure involves the assumption  of another party’s legal 
liability for losses  in connection  with its work on the  project. For example,  under a drilling contract, 
certain risks such as bodily injury, damage to property, and consequential  damages are allocated on a 
reciprocal  basis regardless  of fault. As previously  noted, the operator may agree to be responsible  for 
other risks, such as damage to the drilling contractor’s  tools, damage to the drilling contractor’s  rig, 
and/or downhole  pollution.  Furthermore,  both operators and drilling contractors  may require their 
subcontractors  to “indemnify  and hold harmless”  the operator or drilling  contractor  for third-party  
liability they incur as a result of the subcontractor’s  work for them.  The notion behind this risk transfer is 
that the party performing  the work should  bear responsibility  for any injury or damage  that is incurred by 
third parties in connection  with that work. The  key features of indemnity  provisions  in certain oil and gas 
exploration  and production  contracts are discussed  in greater detail in Chapter 5 of this course.
Independent  Contractor  Liability
Operators,  drilling contractors  and other energy industry companies  may hire subcontractors  to perform 
all or part of the work for which they have contracted.  Companies  who do so face  certain risks in 
connection  with these arrangements.  First, these hiring companies  are also responsible  to the party that 
originally  hired them (i.e., the drilling contractor,  operator, mineral lease owner, or property  owner) for 
any damage to the property that is the result of a subcontractor’s  work. The  basis of this liability is 
usually some form of direct negligence,  such as negligent hiring or supervision  of the subcontractor.  
Second, an operator, drilling contractor,  or other company can be held liable for losses  arising out of the 
acts of its subcontractors  under the theory of vicarious  liability or strict liability. Vicarious  liability is 
liability that attaches even in the absence of direct negligence,  due to a specific legal responsibility  for the 
acts of another.  That is, in certain circumstances,  an operator, drilling contractor,  or other company can be 
held liable for the negligence  of its subcontractor  merely because of the contractual  relationship.  Strict 
liability attaches without the need to show any  negligence  at all. The mere fact that a loss occurs renders 
the energy industry company liable. The circumstances  under which contractors  can be held strictly liable 
for a loss vary by state but commonly  involve extra-hazardous  operations  such as blasting or use of 
hazardous  materials.
Energy Industry  Risks and the CGL Policy
Exhibit 1.2 outlines some of the energy industry’s  key general liability exposures  and the CGL 
applicability  to them. Energy industry companies  have coverage for many of the liabilities they face in 
connection  with both their ongoing and completed  operations,  including  coverage for damage  caused by 
pollution and to the work itself.  While many contractual  liabilities,  such as failure to complete the work 
on time or as specified,  are uninsurable  business risks, energy industry companies  have certain coverage 
for contractually  assumed indemnification  obligations.  Likewise,  companies  have coverage for liabilities  
arising out of their use of subcontractors  and independent  contractors.

to
the

(sometimes
referred
to
as
“broad

coverage).
Contractual
liability
Covers
the
insured’s
assumption
of
liability
in
an
“insured 
contract,”
which
includes
tort
liability
assumed
in
a

in
a

Covers
certain
above-ground
and
below-ground
pollution 
incidents
resulting
from
oil
and
gas
operations.
Completed

Covers
third-party
bodily
injury
or

that
occurs 
during
the

with
completed

including
damage
to

under 
some
circumstances.
Coverage
may
apply
even
if
the
work
that 
produced
the
injury
or
damage
was
performed
many
years 
prior.
“Other”
third-party

Covers
a
broad
array
of
claims
for
bodily

sustained
by
third

liability.
Independent

Responds
to
an
operator,
drilling
contractor,
or
other
energy 
industry
company’s
liability
arising
out
of
its

Although
the
CGL
policy
never
specifically
grants
coverage
for
“damage
to
property
being
used
in
oil 
and
gas
operations,”
“pollution
liability,”
“contractual
liability,”
or
“independent
contractor
liability,”
it 
provides
all
these
coverages—and
then
some—under
its
broad
“Coverage
A”
insuring
agreement.
The 
exact
scope
of
coverage
for
these
sources
of
liability
is
sculpted
in
the
policy
exclusions.
Pollution 
liability
and
contractual
liability
coverage
receive
particularly
detailed
attention
in
the
CGL
exclusions.
In 
fact,
what
coverage
exists
for
these
exposures
is
defined
in
the
exceptions
to
the
exclusions. 
CGL
Policy
Structure
General
liability
insurance
is
a
highly
standardized
coverage.
Both
Insurance
Services
Office,
Inc.
(ISO), 
and
the
American
Association
of
Insurance
Services
(AAIS)
have
standard
general
liability
coverage 
forms.
Of
these,
the
ISO
CGL
form
is
the
most
widely
used
and
is
commonly
viewed
as
the
“standard” 
policy.
The
AAIS
commercial
liability
policy
corresponds
closely
to
the
ISO
form,
but
it
is
not
as
widely 
used.
Some
insurers
use
their
own
nonstandard
forms
to
provide
general
liability
coverage,
but
most 
incorporate
a
significant
amount
of
the
CGL
language.
For
the
remainder
of
this
course,
references
to
the 
CGL
policy
imply
the
2013
edition
of
the
standard
ISO
CGL
policy
unless
otherwise
noted.
References
to 
the
named
insured
will
assume
the
insured
entity
is
an
energy
industry
company
such
as
an
oil
operator, 
drilling
contractor,
well
service
contractor,
or
independent
contractor. 
The
CGL
policy
is
divided
into
four
sections,
which
are
summarized
in
Exhibit
1.3
and
discussed
further 
below.
Section
I
is
where
the
actual
scope
of
coverage
is
defined.
The
remaining
sections
describe
various 
other
terms
and
conditions
of
the
policy. 
9Exhibit
1.3
 
CGL
Policy
Structure
Section
I—Coverages
Contains
three
coverage
parts 
that
define
scope
of
coverage
for 
different
types
of
covered 
damages
Section
II—Who
Is
an
Insured
Stipulates
persons
and
entities 
covered
by
the
policy
Section
III—Limits
of
Insurance
Defines
how
each
of
the
policy’s 
seven
limits
of
insurance
apply
Section
IV—Commercial
General
Liability 
Conditions
Outlines
various
obligations
of
the 
insured
and
the
insurer
Section
I
Section
I
contains
three
coverage
parts
based
on
the
type
of
injury.
Coverage
A
applies
to
liability
for 
bodily
injury
and
property
damage,
and
Coverage
B
applies
to
personal
and
advertising
injury
liability. 
Both
of
these
coverages
are
based
on
the
insured’s
legal
liability
for
the
alleged
damages.
Coverage
C 
provides
a
smaller
amount
of
coverage
for
medical
costs
incurred
by
a
third
party
without
the
need
to 
show
legal
liability.
The
idea
behind
this
coverage
is
that
paying
these
costs
up
front
may
avoid
a
legal 
action
for
damages. 
Each
of
the
coverage
parts
contains
an
insuring
agreement,
which
outlines
the
insurer’s
basic
coverage 
obligations
and
a
number
of
exclusions
that
eliminate
coverage
for
certain
types
of
claims.
A 
“supplementary
payments”
section
describes
additional
amounts
the
insurer
will
pay
for
certain
costs 
under
Coverages
A
and
B. 
Section
II
Section
II
stipulates
who,
other
than
the
named
insured,
is
covered
under
the
policy.
Most
CGL
policies 
will
include
various
categories
of
automatic
insureds—that
is,
they
do
not
have
to
be
named
on
the
policy 
to
be
covered
by
it.
Various
conditions
or
limitations
may
apply
with
respect
to
certain
categories
of 
insureds.
For
example,
employees
are
insureds
only
to
the
extent
their
liability
arises
out
of
their
work
for 
the
named
insured.
The
categories
of
insureds
and
limitations
on
their
insured
status
will
be
examined
in 
more
detail
later
in
the
course. 
Section
III
The
standard
CGL
policy
contains
seven
limits
of
insurance.
Section
III
of
the
policy
sets
forth
how
the 
limits
of
insurance
apply.
Some
of
the
limits
stand
alone,
while
others
operate
in
conjunction
with
other 
policy
limits.
For
example,
the
per
occurrence
limit
is
the
most
the
policy
will
pay
for
all
claims
arising 
out
of
a
specific
accident
or
event,
and
the
general
aggregate
is
the
most
the
policy
will
pay,
in
total,
for 
all
claims
for
the
entire
policy
period.
The
general
aggregate
is
usually
some
multiple
of
the
per 
occurrence
limit.
The
operation
of
these
limits
is
discussed
in
more
detail
later
in
the
course. 
Section
IV
Section
IV
of
the
CGL
policy
outlines
various
conditions
of
coverage.
Some
of
these
conditions
place 
obligations
on
the
insurer,
and
some
impose
obligations
on
the
insured.
For
example,
a
cancellation 
provision
stipulates
an
obligation
on
the
insurer
to
provide
a
certain
number
of
days’
notice
of
its
intent
to 
cancel
the
policy
so
the
named
insured
can
take
steps
to
arrange
replacement
coverage.
Another
provision 
requires
the
insured
to
provide
timely
notice
of
any
legal
action
brought
against
the
insured,
as
well
as
an 
event
that
is
likely
to
result
in
a
legal
action.
This
notice
provisionallows
the
insurer
to
conduct
a
proper 
investigation
of
the
claim.
Similarly,
the
“other
insurance”
provision
stipulates
how
the
policy
will 
respond
when
there
is
another
policy
that
also
covers
a
claim.
The
standard
CGL
policy
is
designed
to
be
10primary—that
is,
it
pays
before
any
other
applicable
insurance—but
some
nonstandard
CGL
policies
may 
apply
on
an
excess
basis.
Policy
conditions
with
specific
implications
for
contractors
are
discussed
in 
more
detail
later
in
the
course. 
Reading
the
Policy
as
a
Whole
Making
a
determination
of
coverage
for
a
particular
claim
or
loss
under
the
CGL
policy
requires
a
reading 
of
all
applicable
policy
provisions.
Although
one
of
the
policy
insuring
agreements
may
indicate
that
a 
particular
claim
is
within
the
scope
of
coverage,
a
number
of
other
policy
provisions
might
apply
to 
remove
coverage.
For
example,
an
exclusion
may
apply,
the
insured
may
have
breached
a
policy 
condition,
or
the
limit
of
insurance
may
have
been
exhausted
by
previous
claims.
Similarly,
a
claim
may 
be
precluded
from
coverage
under
one
coverage
part
but
not
under
another
coverage
part.
If
one
stops 
reading
too
early,
it
is
easy
to
come
to
incorrect
conclusions
about
the
policy’s
coverage
for
a
given 
claim.
Exhibit
1.4
illustrates
the
steps
that
are
involved
in
evaluating
the
CGL
policy’s
applicability
to
a 
given
claim.
Note
that
this
process
considers
only
the
basic
policy.
Many
CGL
policies
issued
to 
operators,
drilling
contractors,
well
service
contractors,
and
other
energy
industry
companies
contain 
endorsements.
To
the
extent
endorsements
are
attached
that
impact
the
scope
of
coverage,
they
must
also 
be
considered.

In this chapter, you should be able to…
1. recognize the elements that must exist in order for a loss to be covered
by a CGL policy.
2. differentiate the two coverage triggers used in CGL insurance policies
3. determine how each type of trigger defines what policy will apply to a
specific instance of injury or damage and
4. define (1) “bodily injury” and (2) “property damage.”
5. Describe the CGL’s coverage territory.

Elements of a Covered Loss
Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability (Coverage A)
• “Bodily Injury” or “property damage” occurs during the policy period.
• “Bodily Injury” or “property damage” is caused by an “occurrence.”
• The “occurrence” takes place in the “coverage territory.”
• The insured is legally liable for the loss.
• The insured was not aware of the “bodily injury” or “property damage,” in whole or in part,
prior to the policy period.
In addition  to covered “bodily injury” or “property  damage,”  the CGL will pay costs it incurs in defending  
or settling  a claim. In the standard CGL policy, and most nonstandard  policies, defense costs are payable 
outside the policy limit, which means they do not reduce the amount of insurance  available to pay claims.Coverage  Trigger
Most businesses  carry insurance  continuously  from year to year. Each time the policy is renewed, a fresh 
set of coverage  limits will apply, and various changes may be made to the policy terms and provisions.  
For example,  new exclusions  may be added, policy definitions  may be changed, new endorsements  may 
be attached, and different deductibles  may apply, among other possible variations.  Determining  the 
coverage available for a given claim, therefore,  requires determining  which policy applies to a given 
claim. The insurance  industry uses what is called a coverage “trigger” to indicate the event that is required 
for the policy to respond to a claim. In this way, both the insurer and the insured can determine  which 
policy’s terms apply.
ISO publishes  two versions of the CGL policy. The primary difference  between the two forms is the event 
that triggers coverage for bodily  injury or property damage (Coverage  A). Under  the occurrence  form, 
coverage is triggered if the injury or damage occurs during the policy period. Under the claims-made  
form, it is the filing of a claim during the policy period that triggers coverage.  The difference  between 
these two coverage triggers is demonstrated  in Exhibit 2.2. The practical impact of this difference  is that 
under an occurrence-based  policy, the insured is covered for injury  or damage that occurred during the 
policy period even if that policy has been expired for years when the actual claim is filed. Claims-made  
coverage,  however, applies only if there is a policy in force when the claim is made, and even then, it may 
place restrictions  on coverage with respect to operations  performed  before a specified date. For this and 
other reasons, claims-made  coverage is generally unpopular  with insureds; therefore,  most CGL policies 
are written with an occurrence  trigger. Consequently,  the remainder  of this discussion  assumes an 
occurrence  trigger. The claims-made  coverage trigger is prevalent in other lines of coverage,  including  
professional  liability, pollution liability, directors and officers liability, and employment  practices liability.
15Exhibit 2.2
Comparison of Occurrence and Claims-Made Coverage Triggers
An operator performs negligent work in 2011 that fails in 2012, resulting in significant damage to
property. A claim is filed by the owner of the damaged property in 2013. Assuming all consecutive
policies run from January 1 to December 31 and have the same type of coverage trigger, the
following would be true:
Occurrence Trigger —2012 policy is triggered because the property damage occurred during its
policy period.
Claims Made Trigger —2013 policy is triggered because the claim is filed during its policy period.
A key aspect of the standard CGL occurrence  trigger is that coverage is triggered by the occurrence  of 
covered injury or damage during the policy period. The date of the accident or event that produces the 
injury does not impact coverage,  nor does the date the claim is filed. Many insurance  professionals  fail to 
recognize  this distinction.
To illustrate, suppose a drilling contractor  negligently  installs a packer into a well in 2012. In December  
2014, the packer fails causing the well to explode, injuring dozens of employees  of an independent  
oilfield service contractor.  Between March and September  of 2015, numerous  claims are filed against the 
drilling contractor  for injuries sustained by these individuals.  If the drilling contractor  carried consecutive  
occurrence-based  CGL policies from 2012 to 2015, each with an effective date of January 1 and an 
expiration  date of December  31 of that same year, which policy could be triggered by this claim? The  
correct answer is the 2014 policy, because it was during 2014 that the injuries were sustained.  Neither the 
2012 policy, which was in effect when the work was  performed,  nor the 2015 policy, which was in effect 
when the claim is filed, is triggered for these losses.
Progressive  Injury or Damage
At first glance, it may appear that determining  the time at which bodily injury or property  damage occurs 
is a simple task, but in the energy industry, it often is not. Sometimes  injury or damage is the result of 
gradual exposure to a hazardous  condition  and is not immediately  apparent. Silicosis is an example of a 
situation in which an injury may start at one point in time and progressively  worsen until its effects are 
finally discovered.  Did the injury occur when the person was exposed to silica, when the first signs of 
injury would have been visible (had they known to  check for them),  or when the person begins to feel the 
effects of the illness? Likewise,  groundwater  contamination  from drilling operations  will not be 
discovered  on adjacent property until it is detected in the adjacent property’s  monitoring  wells. Did the 
property damage occur when the onsite contamination  occurred, when it was detected on the adjacent 
property, or over time as the condition  worsened?
These distinctions  are important,  because the time at which the injury or damage  occurred determines  
which CGL policy has been triggered by the claim. The answer could differ based on the jurisdiction  in 
which the claim is filed. Because it is possible for policies  to be triggered long after they expire, 
operators,  drilling contractors,  and other energy industry companies  are wise to maintain files of their 
expired policies in an indexed storage format for as long as the company exists or is sold, at which time 
the policies should be passed down to the new owner. With the electronic  storage resources  available 
today, storage is less of a burden and less costly than previously.  As long as the limits of coverage have 
not been exhausted,  these policies may still prove valuable long into the future.
16Known
Loss
Restrictions
A
“known
loss”
provision
limits
recovery
for
progressive
injury
or
damage
that
occurs
over
multiple 
policy
periods.
The
standard
CGL
policy
provides
that
it
will
not
respond
to
claims
for
injury
or
damage 
of
which
the
insured
was
already
aware
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
policy
period.
A
common 
misconception
about
the
CGL
known
loss
provision
is
that
it
removes
all
coverage
for
losses
that
occur 
but
are
not
settled
during
the
policy
year.
That
is
simply
not
true.
The
known
loss
provision
is
not 
triggered
in
policies
in
force
when
the
insured
first
becomes
aware
of
a
claim
or
loss.
It
merely
prevents 
coverage
in
any
policy
period
after
the
insured
first
becomes
aware
of
the
injury
or
damage.
Thus,
the 
insured’s
knowledge
is
key
with
regards
to
the
application
of
the
known
loss
provision. 
To
illustrate
the
application
of
this
known
loss
provision,
assume
an
operator
has
a
January
1
renewal
date 
for
its
CGL
insurance.
On
October
15,
2011,
the
operator
receives
notice
of
a
claim.
The
claim
is
settled 
in
July
of
2012.
While
the
2012
policy
will
not
respond
to
the
claim
because
it
was
“known”
by
the 
insured
prior
to
the
policy
effective
date,
the
known
loss
provision
of
the
2011
policy
does
not
apply
at 
all,
because
the
insured
did
not
know
of
the
claim
at
the
beginning
of
the
2011
policy
period.
This
policy, 
therefore,
would
respond
to
the
claim,
subject
to
the
policy’s
other
terms
and
provisions. 
The
standard
CGL
does
not
prevent
the
triggering
of
multiple
prior
policies
as
long
as
covered
injury
or 
damage
occurred
during
each
policy
period
(such
as
on
a
continuous
injury
or
damage
claim)
and
the 
insured
was
not
aware
of
the
injury
or
damage
prior
to
the
inception
of
that
policy’s
coverage
period.
A 
few
nonstandard
policies
take
the
known
loss
restriction
a
step
further
by
adding
a
requirement
that 
coverage
is
restricted
to
the
policy
where
the
insured
first
became
aware
of
the
loss
.
Under
this
approach, 
only
one
policy
will
be
triggered
by
any
given
loss—the
one
that
was
in
effect
when
the
insured
first 
became
aware
of
the
loss. 
Completed
Operations
The
occurrence
trigger
sometimes
makes
completed
operations
coverage
a
confusing
concept.
If
expired 
policies
will
pay
for
injuries
arising
out
of
past
projects,
why
do
companies
need
coverage
for
completed 
operations
under
their
current
policies?
The
answer
is
that,
sometimes,
injury
or
damage
arising
out
of 
past
projects
does
not
occur
until
well
into
the
future.
Remember,
it
is
not
the
time
at
which
the
event
that 
caused
the
damage
(e.g.,
the
negligent
act)
took
place
that
triggers
the
policy,
but
the
time
at
which
bodily 
injury
or
property
damage
occurs.
Therefore,
by
covering
injury
or
damage
that
occurs
during
the
current 
policy
period
but
is
the
result
of
work
that
has
already
been
completed,
the
policy
is
providing
coverage 
that
would
not
exist
under
prior
policies. 
To
illustrate,
suppose
a
drilling
rig’s
platform
collapses
under
the
weight
of
equipment
in
2012,
causing 
damage
to
the
rig
and
its
contents,
and
injuring
five
people.
The
cause
of
the
collapse
is
determined
to
be 
due
to
defective
construction.
The
rig
(including
the
platform)
was
built
during
a
time
frame
spanning 
May
2010
to
June
2011.
Which
policy
is
triggered?
If
it
has
an
occurrence
trigger,
the
2012
policy,
which 
was
in
effect
when
the
platform
collapsed,
is
triggered.
Neither
the
2010
nor
the
2011
policy
is
triggered 
because
the
damage
did
not
occur
during
their
policy
periods.
If
the
2012
policy
did
not
cover
losses
that 
are
the
result
of
completed
projects,
there
would
be
no
coverage
for
this
loss. 
Covered
Damages
The
Coverage
A
insuring
agreement
provides
that
coverage
applies
to
liability
for
“bodily
injury”
or 
“property
damage.”
The
policy’s
definition
of
bodily
injury
includes
sickness,
disease,
and
death,
as
well 
as
physical
injury
to
a
person.
Mental
injuries,
such
as
mental
anguish,
emotional
distress,
and
other 
disorders,
are
covered
if
the
applicable
jurisdiction
recognizes
these
types
of
injuries
as
bodily
injuries. 
(In
most
jurisdictions,
these
types
of
injuries
are
covered
only
if
there
is
accompanying
physical
injury.)
Insurance
professionals
must
distinguish
between
“bodily
injury”
and
“personal
injury.”
While
attorneys 
frequently
use
the
latter
term
to
refer
to
physical
injuries
to
a
person
(what
the
CGL
policy
refers
to
as 
“bodily
injury”),
insurance
policies
clearly
distinguish
the
two.
In
the
CGL
policy,
“personal
injury” 
refers
to
a
variety
of
offenses
against
a
person
other
than
a
physical
injury,
such
as
invasion
of
privacy, 
slander,
libel,
trespass,
and
false
imprisonment.

18Chapter 3
CGL Coverage A Exclusions
19Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn how to…
1. Recognize the purpose of the CGL policy’s exclusions.
2. Analyze the scope of the CGL contractual liability exclusion and explain
how significant contractual liability coverage exists under the CGL policy
despite the exclusion;
3. Recognize the liability and coverage implications of certain energy
industry practices.
4. Analyze the scope of the CGL pollution exclusion and cite two examples
of energy industry pollution liability claims that would be covered by the
CGL policy despite the exclusion;
5. Identify ways to improve or supplement the coverage provided by a
standard CGL policy to address certain needs.
6. Analyze the scope of other exclusions and recognize situations in which
they would or would not preclude coverage.
7. Analyze the scope of the care, custody, and control exclusion, and
identify examples of property damage claims that would not be covered
because of this exclusion.
Analyze the scope of the CGL electronic data exclusion and recognize the
types of claims that would not be covered because of the exclusion.
Once the insuring agreement’s  conditions  have been met, any damages meeting the definitions  of “bodily  
injury” or “property  damage” are covered, subject to the policy limit, unless an exclusion  applies. Most of 
the CGL exclusions  are designed to remove coverage for exposures  that are not common to most 
insureds, that are customarily  covered under other insurance  policies, that underwriters  are not willing to 
cover on a blanket basis, or that are considered  uninsurable.
For example,  the commercial  auto policy covers liability arising out of the use of an automobile;  
therefore,  that exposure is excluded under the CGL policy. Similarly,  exposures  that present a high risk of 
concentrated  loss, such as war, that could result in a catastrophic  loss for the insurer are considered  largely 
uninsurable.  Intentional  losses or losses that are incurred with the intentional  conduct of the insured are 
also uninsurable  because they do not present a statistically  predictable  exposure.  Some risks are excluded 
because they are viewed as merely a cost of doing business, such as the cost of redoing  work that does not 
meet the required standard.Many of the CGL exclusions  are broad in scope, removing  virtually all coverage for a certain category of 
injury or damage.  However,  exceptions  to the exclusion  are then used to sculpt a more precise application  
of the exclusion  by stipulating  certain types of injury or damage  to which the exclusion  will not apply. 
Insurance  professionals  sometimes  make the mistake of believing that the exception  actually “creates” 
coverage,  when in reality, all it says is that in this specific instance, the exclusion  does not apply; 
therefore,  any coverage granted by the insuring agreement  remains. This is an important  distinction,  and 
the misunderstanding  of the way coverage is granted has generated  a great deal of confusion  and 
litigation.
To illustrate, the contractual  liability exclusion  contains an exception  for liability  assumed in an “insured 
contract” (see discussion  below). This exception  has led some to believe that as long as the contract is an 
insured contract, the policy will cover any type of liability  assumed in that contract. This is not so. All the 
policy says is that the contractual  liability exclusion  will not operate with respect to liability assumed in 
an “insured contract.”  Because Coverage  A only insures against “bodily injury” or “property  damage,”  
only contractually  assumed liability for these types of damage are covered. So, in looking at the following  
exclusions,  and the exceptions  to the exclusions,  keep in mind that in no instance is the coverage retained 
through an exception  to an exclusion  broader than the coverage granted in the insuring agreement.

Expected

Injury
or
Damage
Insurance
is
designed
to
indemnify
insureds
for
losses
suffered
fortuitously,
not
intentionally.
For 
example,
insurers
do
not
pay
for
fire
damage
to
a
house
that
was
set
on
fire
by
the
insured
or
for
damage 
to
a
car
that
was
intentionally
rolled
over
a
cliff.
Likewise,
CGL
insurance
does
not
cover
bodily
injury
or 
property
damage
that
was
expected
or
intended
from
the
standpoint
of
the
insured.
Note
that
this 
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
injury
or
damage
that
was
expected
or
intended
as
opposed
to
an
act
that 
was
intended
or
expected. 
Some
insurers
may
argue
that
work
performed
in
a
negligent
manner
is
intentional
because
the 
performance
of
the
work
was
intentional.
However,
it
is
not
the
mere
fact
that
an
act
was
intentional
that 
triggers
this
exclusion
but
that
the
resulting
injury
or
damage
was
intended
or
reasonably
expected
to 
occur
as
a
result
of
that
act.
For
example,
a
drilling
contractor
that
knowingly
uses
defective
drill
casings 
could
reasonably
expect
the
drill
casings
to
fail
and
cause
property
damage.
On
the
other
hand,
a
drilling 
contractor
that
negligently
uses
the
wrong
type
of
drill
casings,
resulting
in
contamination
of
production 
zones,
did
not
intentionally
cause
the
damage
merely
because
it
intentionally
used
the
casings. 
The
phrase
“from
the
standpoint
of
the
insured”
preserves
important
coverage
for
an
insured
that
did
not 
expect
or
intend
injury
or
damage
even
if
another
insured
under
the
policy
did.
As
will
be
discussed
under 
Section
II,
multiple
parties
can
be
insureds
under
the
same
CGL
policy.
However,
because
the
policy 
applies
to
each
insured
separately,
one
insured’s
intentional
causing
of
a
loss
does
not
negate
coverage
for 
“innocent”
insureds
with
respect
to
their
liability
for
that
loss.
For
example,
an
employer
that
is
faulted 
for
negligently
supervising
an
employee
that
commits
an
intentional
act,
like
an
assault,
would
still
be 
entitled
to
coverage
because
the
employer
did
not
act
intentionally. 
Contractual
Liability
Exclusion
Operators,
drilling
contractors,
and
other
energy
industry
companies
often
assume
substantial
liabilities
in
22indemnity,
or
“hold
harmless,”
provisions
in
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
contracts.
In
many 
cases,
the
CGL
will
cover
such
liabilities.
The
insuring
agreement
states
that
the
insurer
will
pay
for 
injury
or
damage
for
which
the
insured
is
“legally
responsible.”
It
does
not
specify
whether
the
legal 
responsibility
arises
out
of
common
law
or
out
of
contractual
obligations. 
However,
insurers
certainly
do
not
intend
to
cover
all
contractual
risks
insureds
might
assume.
The
CGL 
policy
carves
out
coverage
for
certain
contractual
liabilities
by
including
a
broad
contractual
liability 
exclusion
and
then
providing
exceptions
to
the
exclusion.
These
exceptions
define
the
policy’s
contractual 
liability
coverage. 
Exclusion
b.
of
the
CGL
eliminates
coverage
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising
out
of
an 
assumption
of
liability
in
a
contract.
Two
subsequent
exceptions
to
the
exclusion
leave
coverage
in
place 
with
respect
to
liability
(1)
assumed
in
an
“insured
contract,”
as
defined
in
the
policy,
and
(2)
liability 
“that
the
insured
would
have
in
the
absence
of
the
contract
or
agreement.”
These
exceptions
form
the 
framework
for
contractual
liability
insurance
coverage
in
the
CGL
policy. 
While
the
meaning
of
“insured
contract”
is
of
obvious
importance,
note
the
other
exception
to
the 
exclusion,
which
clarifies
that
coverage
is
available
to
the
insured
in
a
case
where
it
would
be
liable
even 
in
the
absence
of
a
contract
or
agreement.
This
merely
prevents
the
insurer
from
using
the
fact
that
the 
contract
stipulates
the
energy
industry
company
is
responsible
for
damages
caused
by
its
own
negligence 
(which
it
would
be
under
common
law
even
without
the
contract)
to
exclude
coverage.
For
example, 
assume
that
Sanders
Cleaning
Services
is
retained
by
Carlton
Oil
and
Gas,
Inc.,
to
perform
industrial 
cleaning
on
parts
of
Carlton’s
refinery.
The
contract
requires
Sanders
to
hold
harmless
and
indemnify 
Carlton
for
any
property
damage
to
the
refinery
arising
from
Sander’s
negligence
in
performing
its 
operations.
A
fire
erupts
one
evening,
damaging
several
storage
tanks
at
the
refinery,
and
it
is
determined 
that
the
fire
resulted
from
Sanders’s
negligence.
Since
Sanders
is
accountable
under
common
law
for
its 
own
torts,
the
CGL
policy
should
respond
on
behalf
of
Sanders
for
its
liability
to
repair
the
damaged 
storage
tanks
(unless
another
exclusion
applies).
The
fact
that
Sanders
had
also
contractually
agreed
to
be 
responsible
for
its
own
negligence
would
not
preclude
coverage. 
Definition
of
“Insured
Contract”
Outside
of
liability
the
insured
would
have
in
the
absence
of
a
contract
or
agreement,
the
CGL
policy 
specifies
that
only
those
liabilities
assumed
in
an
“insured
contract,”
as
the
term
is
defined
in
the
policy, 
are
covered.
For
example,
assume
that
the
contract
between
Sanders
and
Carlton
requires
Sanders
to 
indemnify
and
hold
harmless
Carlton
for
any
damage
to
the
refinery,
regardless
of
the
cause.
The
fire 
breaks
out
on
storage
tanks
located
in
a
different
building
of
the
refinery
complex
than
the
one
on
which 
Sanders
is
cleaning
and
can
in
no
way
be
attributable
to
Sanders’s
negligence.
Since
Sanders
would
not 
be
liable
in
the
absence
of
the
contract,
any
coverage
for
liability
Sanders
incurs
for
damage
to
the 
building
because
of
this
contractual
agreement
would
have
to
come
under
the
second
part
of
the 
contractual
liability
provision,
the
exception
for
an
“insured
contract.” 
The
CGL
policy’s
definition
of
“insured
contract”
includes
six
distinctive
categories
of
contracts
that
will 
qualify
for
the
exception
to
the
contractual
liability
exclusion.
The
first
five
parts
of
this
definition
grant 
“insured
contract”
status
based
on
the
type
of
contract.
The
last
part
addresses
a
type
of
provision
that
can 
appear
in
a
broad
array
of
business
contracts.
Fortunately,
many
of
the
agreements
energy
industry 
companies
routinely
enter
into
are
“insured
contracts,”
including
indemnity
agreements
within
drilling 
contracts,
master
service
agreements,
well
site
consulting
agreements,
mineral
leases,
equipment
leases, 
joint
operating
agreements,
rental
agreements,
and
purchase
and
sale
agreements.
The
types
of
contracts 
that
meet
the
policy’s
definition
of
“insured
contract,”
as
well
as
exceptions
to
some
categories
of 
contracts,
are
summarized
in
Exhibit
3.2
and
discussed
in
more
detail
below.

party
to
pay 
for
third-party
“bodily

or
“property

(1)
An
agreement
to
indemnify
a
railroad
for
injury 
or
damage
arising
out
of
construction
or
demolition 
operations,
within
50
feet
of
any
railroad
property, 
including
any
railroad
bridge,
trestle,
tracks, 
road-beds,
tunnel,
underpass,
or
crossing
(2)
An
agreement
to
indemnify
an
architect, 
engineer,
or
surveyor
for
injury
or
damage
arising 
out
of:
(a)
the
preparation
or
approval
(or
failing
to 
prepare
or
approve)
of
design-related
documents; 
or
(b)
giving
(or
failing
to
give)
directions
or 
instructions
(3)
An
agreement
under
which
an
insured
architect, 
engineer,
or
surveyor
assumes
liability
for
an
injury 
or
damage
arising
out
of:
(a)
its
rendering
(or
failure 
to
render)
professional
services
and
(b)
its 
supervisory,
inspection,
architectural,
or
engineering 
activities
Lease
of
Premises
It
is
very
common
for
leases
to
include
a
hold
harmless
clause
requiring
the
lessee
(the
tenant)
to
hold
the 
lessor
(property
owner)
harmless
for
liability
arising
from
the
use
of
the
premises.
This
portion
of
the 
definition
would
pertain
to
the
energy
industry
company’s
leased
premises,
such
as
its
offices
and
storage 
facilities,
and
not
to
the
well
or
drilling
site.
An
exception
to
this
category
of
insured
contracts
is
for 
damage
to
the
premises
caused
by
fire
if
the
insured
is
liable
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
contractual 
agreement,
and
not
under
tort
law.
(Another
policy
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
damage
to
property 
owned,
rented,
or
occupied
by
the
named
insured
for
which
the
insured
is
liable.
This
exposure
is
best 
handled
by
purchasing
first-party
property
insurance
on
the
leased
premises
to
protect
the
interests
of
both 
parties.) 
Note
that
leases
of
property
other
than
premises
are
not
“insured
contracts”
under
this
part
of
the 
definition.
However,
indemnity
agreements
within
leases
involving
other
types
of
property,
such
as
heavy 
oilfield
equipment,
may
qualify
under
the
last
category
of
“insured
contracts.”
The
distinction
is 
important
because
the
latter
category
is
more
restrictive
with
respect
to
the
types
of
liability
that
are 
covered.
Specifically,
the
last
category
of
contracts
applies
only
to
the
assumption
of
another
party’s
tort
24liability,
whereas
the
lease
of
premises
category
contains
no
such
restriction. 
Sidetrack
Agreements
Many
insureds
have
spurs
or
sidetracks
that
connect
their
facilities
to
a
main
railroad
line.
As
a
condition 
within
the
sidetrack
agreement,
the
railroad
will
normally
require
the
firm
to
hold
it
harmless
from
losses 
arising
out
of
the
use
of
the
sidetrack.
Such
sidetrack
agreements
are
“insured
contracts.” 
Easements
An
easement
is
an
interest
that
one
party
has
in
the
land
of
another
or
a
right
of
use
over
another
party’s 
property.
An
easement
may
be
implied
or
it
may
be
created
by
necessity
or
by
prescription.
An
easement 
by
prescription
arises
when
one
person
uses
another
person’s
land
for
some
period
of
time
during
which 
the
owner
of
the
property
does
not
object
to
the
use
of
the
property.
For
example,
in
an
oil
and
gas
setting, 
an
adjacent
property
owner
may
consent
to
allow
the
operator
and
drilling
contractor
to
use
its
property
to 
access
the
onshore
mineral
estate.
A
license
is
a
right
to
come
onto
another
party’s
property
that
arises 
from
the
consent
of
the
owner
and
can
be
revoked
at
any
time.
With
an
easement
or
license
agreement,
it 
is
generally
the
party
enjoying
the
benefit
of
being
on
the
property
of
another
that
assumes
the
liability
of 
the
property
owner.
Easement
and
license
agreements
are
“insured
contracts”
unless
they
are
in 
connection
with
construction
or
demolition
operations
on
or
within
50
feet
of
a
railroad.
Insurers
will 
usually
attach
an
endorsement
that
brings
indemnification
agreements
executed
in
connection
with 
operations
on
or
near
a
railroad
under
the
definition
of
“insured
contract”
if
requested
to
do
so. 
Municipal
Ordinance
Obligations
Many
municipalities
have
ordinances
requiring
indemnification
from
private
citizens
or
organizations
that 
erect
any
kind
of
obstruction
or
device
that
can
cause
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
to
members
of
the 
public,
and
these
also
qualify
as
“insured
contracts.”
This
indemnification
requirement
may
simply
result 
from
an
ordinance—it
is
not
necessarily
imposed
by
a
specific
contract
between
the
municipality
and
the 
insured.
However,
if
an
insured
performs
work
for
the
municipality,
an
ordinance-imposed 
indemnification
in
connection
with
that
work
is
not
included
in
this
particular
portion
of
the
definition
of 
“insured
contract.”
Such
indemnification
is
included
as
an
“insured
contract”
under
the
last
part
of
that 
definition
(paragraph
f.). 
Elevator
Maintenance
Agreements
An
agreement
stipulating
terms
for
maintaining
or
servicing
elevators
is
an
insured
contract
under
part
e. 
of
the
definition.
Because
of
the
similar
purpose,
operation,
and
use
of
the
two,
this
definition
would 
probably
encompass
escalator
service
agreements
as
well. 
Indemnification
Agreements
The
last
category
of
insured
contracts,
paragraph
f.,
is
where
energy
industry
companies
obtain
coverage 
for
liabilities
assumed
in
drilling
contracts,
master
service
agreements,
well
site
consulting
agreements, 
mineral
leases,
equipment
leases,
joint
operating
agreements,
rental
agreements,
work
orders,
and 
purchase
and
sale
agreements,
and
similar
contracts.
For
example,
when
an
insured
operator
agrees
to 
assume
the
tort
liability
of
a
drilling
contractor,
the
drilling
contractor’s
subcontractors,
or
an
equipment 
lessor
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage,
the
insured
operator’s
policy
will
respond
to
that
liability, 
subject
to
the
policy’s
other
exclusions
and
conditions. 
To
qualify,
the
contract
must
pertain
to
the
named
insured’s
business
and
it
must
be
made
before
the 
“bodily
injury”
or
“property
damage”
occurs.
Thus,
energy
industry
companies
have
no
coverage
if
they 
agree
to
be
responsible
for
a
loss
only
after
it
has
already
occurred.
While
it
might
seem
unlikely
that
any 
company
would
do
such
a
thing,
if
not
doing
so
means
losing
a
valuable
client,
the
company
might 
consider
the
loss
of
future
revenues
to
be
more
damaging
than
any
amounts
it
has
to
pay
for
this
loss. 
While
energy
industry
companies
are
free
to
take
on
such
liabilities,
they
cannot
look
to
their
insurance 
policies
to
pay
the
loss
on
their
behalf
because
insurance
covers
fortuitous
losses. 
Notice
that
only
the
portion
of
the
contract
where
the
insured
assumes
the
tort
liability
of
another
(e.g.,
25the
indemnity
provision)
is
considered
an
“insured
contract.”
This
clarifies
that,
with
respect
to
contracts 
that
are
“insured
contracts”
only
under
part
f.
of
that
definition,
the
contractual
liability
coverage
of
the 
CGL
policy
will
not
respond
to
a
warranty
of
performance,
breach
of
contract,
or
any
other
form
of 
contractual
obligation
that
is
not
based
in
tort
law. 
The
contract
does
not
have
to
be
in
writing,
although
that
is
certainly
helpful
in
establishing
the
intent
of 
the
parties
and
energy
industry
custom
usually
involves
written
contracts.
If
an
unsigned
draft
of
the 
contract
or
even
the
existence
of
an
implied
or
verbal
agreement
for
indemnity
can
be
established,
the 
CGL
policy
will
cover
the
company’s
indemnification
obligation,
provided
that
the
company
complies 
with
all
other
coverage
provisions. 
No
limitations
are
placed
on
the
degree
of
contractually
assumed
liability
that
is
covered.
That
is,
the 
policy
will
respond
to
contractual
liability
arising
from
the
indemnitee’s
sole
negligence,
joint
negligence, 
or
contributory
negligence
as
long
as
the
contract
in
which
the
liabilities
are
assumed
is
an
“insured 
contract,”
the
indemnity
clause
is
valid
and
enforceable,
and
the
liability
is
for
bodily
injury
or
property 
damage. 
With
respect
to
whether
an
indemnity
clause
is
valid
and
enforceable,
the
applicable
state
oilfield 
anti-indemnity
statute,
if
any,
will
largely
determine
the
scope
of
coverage
preserved
for
the
contractual 
assumption
of
another
party’s
tort
liabilities.
Furthermore,
in
certain
states,
a
construction
anti-indemnity 
statute
may
provide
a
second
basis
for
determining
the
scope
of
coverage
for
contractual
assumption
of 
another
party’s
tort
liabilities.
(Anti-indemnity
statutes
and
their
impact
on
the
scope
of
contractual 
liability
coverage
in
standard
insurance
policies
are
examined
at
length
in
a
separate
ERIS
course, 
“Contractual
Risk
Transfer
in
the
Energy
Industry.”) 
Exceptions
Three
exceptions
specify
types
of
indemnity
provisions
that
are
not
insured
contracts.
The
first
of
these
is 
an
agreement
to
indemnify
a
railroad
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising
from
construction
or 
demolition
operations
on
or
near
railroad
property.
Such
indemnification
is
commonly
imposed
on 
companies
working
on
or
near
railroad
property.
Since
they
are
specifically
not
included
as
insured 
contracts,
no
coverage
would
apply
to
these
assumptions
of
liability. 
The
common
method
of
insuring
this
exposure,
and
the
method
typically
required
by
railroads,
is
for
the 
company
to
purchase
a
railroad
protective
liability
policy,
under
which
the
railroad
is
the
named
insured. 
However,
the
purchase
of
such
a
policy
does
not
necessarily
eliminate
the
company’s
contractual
liability 
exposure
under
the
agreement
with
the
railroad
for
two
reasons.
First,
a
liability
loss
involving
a
train
can 
easily
exceed
the
policy
limits
of
the
railroad
protective
policy,
and
the
railroad
will
undoubtedly
seek 
indemnification
for
its
loss
in
excess
of
its
insurance
protection.
Second,
railroad
protective
insurers 
usually
maintain
the
right
to
pursue
recovery
from
(i.e.,
to
subrogate
against)
the
company
for
amounts 
paid
under
the
policy.
If
the
company
was
negligent
in
causing
the
loss—and
would
be
liable
even
in
the 
absence
of
the
contractual
assumption—the
company’s
CGL
policy
would
cover
the
subrogation
action. 
If,
however,
the
action
is
based
on
the
indemnity
obligation
in
the
contract,
the
CGL
policy
would
not 
respond.
This
coverage
limitation
should
be
deleted
from
the
CGL
policies
of
companies
that
agree
to 
indemnify
railroads
in
connection
with
their
work.
A
standard
endorsement
is
available
for
this
purpose. 
The
second
and
third
exceptions
to
the
definition
of
“insured
contract”
pertain
to
professional
liability 
with
respect
to
architects,
engineers,
or
surveyors.
No
coverage
is
provided
for
a
contractual
assumption 
of
professional
liability
if
the
insured,
or
the
indemnitee
of
the
insured,
is
an
architect,
engineer,
or 
surveyor.
Frequently,
contractual
agreements
between
these
professionals
and
their
clients
will
affirm
the 
professional’s
responsibility
for
liability
arising
from
his
or
her
work.
These
exceptions
prevent 
professional
liability
claims
from
being
covered
under
the
CGL’s
contractual
liability
insurance.
A 
separate
endorsement
is
often
attached
to
the
policy
to
preclude
coverage
for
direct
claims
involving 
professional
liability.
(See
the
discussion
of
professional
liability
exclusion
endorsements
later
in
this 
course.)
While,
in
general,
it
is
not
legally
permissible
to
contractually
transfer
the
professional
liability
of 
an
architect
or
engineer
to
another
party,
these
types
of
transfers
do
sometimes
appear
in
design
contracts. 
This
exception
makes
it
clear
that
such
contractually
assumed
liabilities
are
excluded. 
26The
exception
for
the
assumption
of
professional
liabilities
is
frequently
misunderstood
to
be
a
total 
exclusion
of
liabilities
assumed
in
a
contract
with
a
design
professional.
While
energy
industry
companies 
must
be
extremely
careful
not
to
accept
transfers
of
professional
services
liability,
other
forms
of
liability 
that
are
transferred
from
a
professional
services
firm
to
the
energy
industry
company
may
be
covered.
For 
example,
liability
incurred
by
the
professional
services
company
arising
out
of
ordinary
(not
professional) 
negligence
would
be
covered
if
the
company
has
assumed
responsibility
for
these
liabilities
in
an 
enforceable
hold
harmless
agreement.
It
is
only
the
assumption
of
professional
liability
that
is
excluded. 
For
example,
the
operator
contracts
with
an
engineer
to
have
the
engineer
supervise
and
report
on
the 
progress
of
independent
contractors
at
drilling
site,
and
the
operator
agrees
to
assume
the
engineer’s 
liability
for
injury
or
damage
sustained
to
the
drilling
contractor
and
the
drilling
contractor’s
group
(the 
operator
and
drilling
contractor’s
groups
are
explained
in
greater
detail
in
Chapter
5
of
this
course)
as
a 
result
of
the
engineer’s
supervision.
The
drilling
contractor’s
employee
is
injured
when
he
negligently 
removes
a
cement
head,
and
the
engineer
negligently
failed
to
supervise
the
removal.
This
type
of 
contractually
assumed
liability
would
be
covered
because
the
supervision,
or
failure
to
supervise,
removal 
of
the
cement
head
did
not
require
professional
engineering
expertise
or
other
professional
expertise. 
There
is
one
other
important
exception
that
can
arise
in
connection
with
indemnity
provisions
in
oil
and 
gas
contracts.
Indemnity
provisions
in
these
contracts
often
transfer
responsibility
for
risk
without
regard 
to
fault.
For
example,
under
"sound
location"
provisions
in
drilling
contracts,
the
operator
is
asked
to 
assume
liability
for
the
rig
even
in
the
absence
of
the
operator's
fault
or
tort
liability.
Therefore,
under 
sound
location
provisions,
when
the
operator
agrees
to
accept
liability
for
the
driller's
own
equipment, 
even
if
it
is
damaged
by
the
sole
fault
of
the
driller,
an
argument
exists
that
the
operator
is
not
thereby 
taking
on
the
"tort
liability
of
another"
since
the
driller
cannot
have
“tort
liability”
for
damaging
its
own 
equipment.
If
the
driller’s
rig
is
damaged
by
the
driller
as
opposed
to
the
operator,
an
insurer
may
argue 
that
there
is
no
coverage
for
contractual
liability
for
damage
to
the
driller's
property
where
that
liability
is 
assumed
without
regard
to
fault.
The
insurer
could
argue
that,
because
the
driller
has
no
"tort
liability"
for 
damage
to
its
own
property
and
because
there
is
coverage
only
for
the
operator's
assumption
of
tort 
liability,
there
is
no
contractual
liability
coverage
for
the
promise
to
indemnify
the
driller
for
loss
to
its 
own
equipment
due
to
its
own
fault.
One
possible
solution
is
to
broaden
coverage
by
removing
the
word 
“tort,”
thereby
eliminating
the
“tort
liability”
requirement
from
the
definition
of
“insured
contract.” 
However,
this
approach
is
not
foolproof
and
does
not
solve
the
problem
of
a
party’s
direct
liability
in
the 
absence
of
fault. 
Exceptions
for
Non-Operators
as
Named
Insureds
As
previously
noted,
joint
ventures
are
commonly
formed
in
connection
with
oil
and
gas
exploration
and 
production
activities.
Parties
to
a
joint
venture
enter
into
a
joint
operating
agreement
(JOA),
a
contract 
that
serves
several
purposes,
including
identifying
the
property
interests
of
the
parties
in
the
applicable 
mineral
lease.
In
a
JOA,
one
of
the
co-owner
of
the
mineral
lease
(typically
the
co-owner
with
the
largest 
working
interest
in
the
mineral
lease
or
the
most
operating
expertise)
is
designated
operator.
The
operator 
has
responsibility
for
the
actual
operation
of
the
well
or
mine.
The
other
co-owners
are
designated 
“nonoperators.”
Nonoperators
are
investors
in
the
venture
who
are
responsible
for
a
portion
of
the 
ongoing
costs
associated
with
the
venture,
and
receive
profits
from
successful
wells,
but
do
not
participate 
in
or
have
any
responsibility
for
the
actual
operation
of
the
well
or
mine.
An
example
of
an
operating 
group’s
interest
in
a
mineral
lease
might
be
helpful.
Exhibit
3.3
illustrates
the
operating
group
for
the 
Macondo
exploratory
well. 
27Exhibit
3.3
 
Operating
Group
for
the
Macondo
Exploratory
Well
The
JOA
also
sets
forth
the
method
for
sharing
expenses
and
for
the
allocation
of
liability
with
respect
to 
the
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
operations.
JOAs
usually
contain
an
exculpatory
provision 
eliminating
an
operator’s
liability,
absent
the
operator’s
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct.
Liability 
under
a
JOA
is
several,
meaning
each
party
is
responsible
for
its
share
of
claim
costs,
absent
the 
operator’s
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct.
Furthermore,
the
JOA
typically
requires
the
operator
to 
purchase
insurance,
including
CGL,
for
the
benefit
of
the
joint
venture
and
the
parties
to
the
JOA,
and
the 
nonoperators
are
usually
named
as
additional
insureds
under
the
operator’s
insurance
policies. 
However,
CGL
coverage
is
not
always
required
by
the
JOA,
and,
therefore,
nonoperators
need
to
have 
their
own
insurance,
either
primary
(if
there
is
no
CGL
coverage
under
the
JOA)
or
excess
of
the 
coverage
provided
by
the
JOA.
Nonoperators
are
not
always
named
in
suits
against
the
Operator.
This 
creates
a
potential
problem
for
the
non-operators
because
coverage
under
their
own
CGL
policy
may
not 
be
triggered.
Most
CGL
policies
do
not
address
the
exposure
that
exists
when
a
nonoperator
is
a
named 
insured
but
is
not
named
in
the
lawsuit
against
the
operator.
A
few
insurers
have
modified
the
contractual 
liability
exclusion
to
address
this
situation.
The
modified
language
creates
an
exception
to
the
contractual 
liability
exclusion
which
preserves
coverage
for
the
liability
of
the
operator
or
any
co-owners
to
pay 
damages
if
the
named
insured
assumed
such
liability
as
operating
expenses
under
a
JOA
for
any
well,
oil 
lease,
or
gas
lease
the
named
insured
owns
but
does
not
operate. 
Consider
the
following
example. 
•
The
operator
owns
a
50%
working
interest
in
the
mineral
lease.
•
Nonoperator
A
and
Nonoperator
B
each
own
25%
working
interests
in
the
mineral
lease.
•
Operator,
Nonoperator
A,
and
Nonoperator
B
are
parties
to
a
JOA
with
an
exculpatory
clause
but 
the
JOA
does
not
require
Operator
to
purchase
insurance
for
the
benefit
of
the
joint
venture
and
the 
parties
to
the
JOA.
•
Nonoperator
A’s
CGL
policy
contains
the
modified
version
of
the
contractual
liability
exclusion, 
but
Nonoperator
B’s
CGL
policy
contains
the
standard
contractual
liability
exclusion.
The
Operator
hires
a
contractor
to
perform
fracking
operations
but
the
operations
fail
and
the
well
must 
be
plugged
and
abandoned.
One
of
the
contractor’s
employee’s
is
injured
during
the
operations.
The 
employee
sues
the
Operator,
alleging
that
the
Operator’s
ordinary
(not
gross)
negligence
caused
his 
injuries.
Nonoperator
A
and
Nonoperator
B
are
not
named
as
defendants
to
the
lawsuit
but
are
liable
for
28their
share
of
any
judgment
or
settlement
because
the
Operator’s
conduct
did
not
amount
to
gross 
negligence
or
willful
misconduct.
The
Operator
reaches
a
settlement
with
the
employee
and
invoices 
Nonoperator
A
and
Nonoperator
B
for
their
share
of
the
damages
paid.
Both
Nonoperator
A
and 
Nonoperator
B
seek
coverage
for
the
claim
under
their
CGL
policies.
Nonoperator
B’s
insurer
denies
the 
claim.
However,
Nonoperator
A’s
policy
will
respond
to
the
liability
it
assumed
to
pay
damages
under
the 
JOA,
subject
to
the
policy’s
other
exclusions
and
conditions,
because
the
modified
language
of
the 
contractual
liability
exclusion
expressly
preserves
coverage
for
this
liability. 
The
example
discussed
above
illustrates
how
nonoperators
might
have
exposure
under
their
own
CGL 
policies.
Nonoperators
should
consider
modifying
the
contractual
liability
exclusion
in
their
own
CGL 
policies
to
preserve
coverage
for
contractually
assumed
liability
to
pay
operating
expenses
under
a
JOA 
for
any
well,
oil
lease,
or
gas
lease
they
own
but
do
not
operate. 
Liquor
Liability
Exclusion
The
liquor
liability
exclusion
precludes
coverage
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
for
which
any 
insured
may
be
held
liable
relating
to
the
furnishing
of
alcoholic
beverages.
However,
the
exclusion 
applies
only
if
the
named
insured
is
in
the
business
of
manufacturing,
distributing,
selling,
serving,
or 
furnishing
alcoholic
beverages.
Consequently,
it
has
virtually
no
impact
on
energy
industry
companies.
In 
the
event
an
energy
industry
company
is
sued
for
injury
or
damage
associated
with
its
providing
of 
alcohol
at
company-sponsored
parties
or
events,
there
would
be
coverage
for
the
claim
under
the
CGL 
policy.
(This
exposure
is
often
referred
to
as
“host
liquor
liability.”) 
Workers
Compensation
and
Similar
Laws
Exclusion
Exclusion
d.
of
the
CGL
policy
precludes
coverage
for
any
obligation
the
insured
may
have
under 
workers
compensation,
disability
benefits,
and
unemployment
compensation
laws.
These
coverages
are 
provided
under
separate
policies
designed
specifically
to
handle
these
exposures.
The
exclusion
in
the 
CGL
policy,
therefore,
avoids
a
potential
overlap
in
coverage. 
Employers
Liability
Exclusion
The
employers
liability
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
any
claim
arising
out
of
bodily
injury
to
an 
employee
of
the
insured
if
the
injury
is
sustained
as
a
result
of
that
employment.
Injuries
to
workers
are 
normally
covered
by
workers
compensation
insurance,
but
even
if
they
fall
outside
the
workers 
compensation
statute,
they
are
not
covered
by
the
CGL
policy.
Claims
brought
by
an
injured
employee’s 
family
members
for
loss
of
consortium,
companionship,
etc.,
as
a
consequence
of
an
employee’s
bodily 
injury,
are
also
excluded.
All
of
these
types
of
claims
are
covered
under
the
employers
liability
coverage 
section
of
the
workers
compensation
insurance
policy
that
most
employers
are
required
by
law
to
carry.
The
only
exception
to
the
employers
liability
exclusion
is
liability
that
the
insured
company
assumes 
under
an
“insured
contract.”
This
exception
preserves
coverage
under
the
CGL
policy
for
third-party-over 
actions,
in
which
a
company’s
employee
sues
a
third
party
(e.g.,
the
operator’s
drilling
fluids
contractor’s 
sues
the
operator)
for
injuries
sustained
while
working
on
the
project.
The
operator
then
looks
to
the 
drilling
fluids
contractor
for
a
defense
and
indemnification
of
damages,
in
accordance
with
a
hold 
harmless
agreement
in
the
contract
with
the
drilling
fluids
contractor.
The
“insured
contract”
exception
to 
the
employers
liability
exclusion
preserves
coverage
for
third-party-over
claims.
The
policy’s
definition 
of
the
term
“employee”
does
not
include
temporary
workers,
such
as
seasonal
workers,
a
substitute
for
a 
permanent
employee
who
is
on
leave,
and
other
short-term
workers.
As
a
result,
temporary
workers
are 
not
prevented
from
bringing
a
claim
against
the
insured
for
injuries
sustained
in
connection
with
their 
work
for
the
insured.
The
CGL
policy
will
respond
to
such
claims. 
Pollution
Exclusion
CGL
coverage
for
energy
risks
will
almost
always
be
modified
by
pollution
exclusions
different
from
the 
“absolute”
exclusion
found
in
the
basic
policy. 
The
pollution
exclusion
omits
coverage
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
“discharge,
dispersal,
seepage,
29migration,
release
or
escape
of
pollutants.”
This
wording
is
designed
to
encompass
virtually
any
means
by 
which
pollutants
enter
or
are
spread
through
the
environment—ground,
water,
or
air.
The
term 
“pollutants”
is
defined
in
the
exclusion
as
“any
solid,
liquid,
gaseous
or
thermal
irritant
or
contaminant, 
including
smoke,
vapor,
soot,
fumes,
acids,
alkalis,
chemicals
and
waste.” 
The
current
standard
CGL
pollution
exclusion
is
commonly
known
as
the
“absolute”
pollution
exclusion 
that
removes
liability
coverage
with
respect
to
most
pollution
events
that
occur
in
the
course
of
an 
insured’s
business
operations.
This
name,
however,
is
a
misnomer,
as
the
five
subparts
of
the
exclusion, 
in
which
its
application
is
qualified,
actually
leave
some
coverage
intact.
The
coverage
energy
industry 
companies
retain
through
exceptions
to
the
pollution
exclusion
is
summarized
in
Exhibit
3.4.

that
is
caused
by 
smoke,

the
building; 
or
from

brought
the
contaminants
onto
the

•
Accidental
discharge
of

if
you
are
a

that
are
essential
to
the

or
fumes
from
a
“hostile

(unless
related
to
remedial
operations)
Premises
Exposures
With
one
exception,
the
CGL
provides
no
coverage
for
any
pollution
that
is
confined
to
or
that
originates 
from
the
insured’s
own
premises,
including
any
location
that
is
currently
or
was
ever
owned
or
occupied 
by
or
rented
or
loaned
to
the
insured
or
any
other
insured.
The
only
exception
to
this
portion
of
the 
exclusion
is
for
“bodily
injury”
sustained
in
a
building
and
caused
by
smoke,
fumes,
vapor,
or
soot
from 
equipment
used
to
heat
the
building.
This
exception
preserves
coverage
for
bodily
injury
arising
out
of 
accidents
such
as
the
escape
of
carbon
monoxide
from
a
defective
furnace. 
Operations
Exposures—Handling
of
Pollutants
Where
the
insured’s
primary
function
at
any
other
site
is
to
clean
up,
monitor,
contain,
treat,
or
test
for 
pollutants,
the
exclusion
will
also
apply—likewise
for
liability
arising
out
of
the
use
of
any
site
for 
storage,
disposal,
processing,
or
treatment
of
waste
and
liability
arising
out
the
transportation
of
wastes
by 
or
for
an
insured.
This
is
significant
for
energy
industry
companies
who
perform
environmental 
remediation
services
or
provide
hazardous
waste
transportation
services.
Energy
industry
companies
who 
perform
environmental
remediation
services
or
who
provide
hazardous
waste
transportation
services 
should
consider
purchasing
pollution
legal
liability,
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance,
or
other 
specialty
environmental
insurance.
Pollution
legal
liability
and
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance 
are
briefly
discussed
in
greater
detail
later
in
this
chapter. 
Operations
Exposures—Other
With
respect
to
operations
other
than
the
type
described
above,
the
CGL
pollution
exclusion
only
applies 
to
operations
on
which
the
insured
(or
its
contractors
or
subcontractors)
“are
performing”
operations.
The 
present
tense
implies
that
the
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
(thus,
coverage
does
exist
for)
completed 
operations.
In
fact,
nothing
in
the
CGL
pollution
exclusion
directly
addresses
the
completed
operations 
hazard,
and
those
exclusions
that
do
apply
to
completed
operations
are
by
virtue
of
a
broad
exclusion
that 
does
not
use
the
“are
performing
operations”
language.
Therefore,
a
broad
scope
of
coverage
is
available 
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
caused
by
pollution
at
a
site
on
which
the
insured
is
no
longer 
performing
work. 
With
respect
to
ongoing
operations,
the
pollution
exclusion
only
applies
if
the
pollutants
were
brought 
onto
the
job
site
by
the
insured
or
the
insured’s
contractor
or
its
subcontractors.
For
example,
if
the 
operator’s
well
service
contractor
accidentally
ruptures
an
underground
pipe
that
leaks
contaminants
into 
the
soil,
air,
or
waterways,
the
exclusion
will
not
apply.
There
are
even
a
few
exceptions
to
the
exclusion 
for
contaminants
that
are
brought
to
the
site
by
the
insured
or
the
insured’s
contractor
or
its 
subcontractors.
Most
notably,
a
release
of
fuel,
lubricants,
and
other
potential
“pollutants”
that
are
needed 
for
the
operation
of
the
insured’s
equipment
is
not
excluded
if
they
accidentally
spill
or
escape
from
the
31equipment
they
are
intended
to
help
function.
That
is,
if
a
fuel
tank
on
a
bulldozer
is
punctured
by
a 
forklift
and
fuel
leaks
out,
the
exclusion
would
not
apply.
However,
if
the
insured
brings
a
fuel
tank
to
the 
site
for
refueling
purposes,
and
the
tank
is
ruptured,
the
exclusion
would
apply. 
Other
coverage
that
is
left
intact
by
the
pollution
exclusion
includes
liability
for
damages
caused
by
heat, 
smoke,
or
fumes
from
a
“hostile
fire.”
(A
“hostile”
fire
is
generally
defined
as
a
fire
that
is
outside
its 
intended
scope
or
boundaries.)
In
other
words,
contamination
of
the
air
caused
by
smoke
from
an 
unintended
fire
at
the
construction
site
would
not
be
an
excluded
“pollution”
incident;
on
the
other
hand, 
contamination
by
smoke
from
the
controlled
burning
of
scrap,
or
from
fires
kindled
in
metal
drums
to 
provide
warmth
to
workers
on
a
drilling
rig,
would
be
“pollution,”
and
any
resulting
liability
would
be 
excluded. 
Waste
and
Waste
Sites
Exclusions
Some
CGL
policies
issued
to
insureds
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
contain
additional
exclusions
which
may 
apply
to
pollution
liability.
For
example,
a
CGL
policy
may
also
contain
a
“waste
site”
exclusion
under 
which
the
policy
does
not
apply
to
any
injury,
damage,
expense,
cost,
“loss”,”
liability,
or
legal
obligation 
arising
out
of
or
in
any
way
related
to
any
actual
or
alleged
discharge,
dispersal,
seepage,
migration, 
release,
or
escape
of
“pollutants”
at,
from,
or
related
to
any
“waste
site.”
The
definition
of
“waste
site” 
could
vary
by
insurer
but
generally
includes
any
premises,
site,
or
location
not
owned,
occupied
by,
or 
rented
or
loaned
to
any
insured
which
is
or
was
at
any
time
licensed
or
subject
to
licensing
or
reporting 
requirements
by
a
regulatory
authority
for
the
recycling,
reconditioning,
reclamation,
storage,
disposal, 
processing
or
treatment
of
waste,
including
any
materials
that
were
discarded
or
have
been
removed
as 
part
of
any
environmental
remediation
effort.
The
“waste
site”
exclusion
can
have
significant
implications 
for
energy
industry
companies
that
own
or
dispose
into
salt
water
disposal
wells
or
if
the
company
owns 
or
operates
salt
water
pipelines
or
if
the
company
reuses
produced
water
since
the
salt
water
disposal 
wells,
salt
water
pipelines,
and
wells
holding
produced
water
could
be
considered
waste
sites. 
Consequently,
it
is
important
for
companies
in
the
energy
industry
to
amend
the
definition
of
“waste
site” 
so
that
it
does
not
include
salt
water
disposal
wells,
salt
water
pipelines,
and
any
containers
that
hold 
produced
water.
The
exclusion
itself
should
also
be
amended
to
address
the
unloading
or
loading
of 
pollutants
at
a
salt
water
disposal
facility. 
As
previously
noted,
the
CGL
policy’s
definition
of
“pollutants”
includes
“waste.”
Some
CGL
policies
do 
not
define
the
term
“waste”
and
other
CGL
policies
contain
a
definition
that
is
extremely
broad.
For 
example,
a
policy
might
define
waste
as
materials
to
be
recycled,
reconditioned,
or
reclaimed.
This 
definition
of
“waste”
is
problematic
because
oil
and
gas
operations
typically
use
or
produce
substances 
that
qualify
as
“waste.”
For
example,
produced
water
that
is
reused
in
fracking
operations
would
qualify 
as
“waste.”
It
is
important
for
energy
industry
companies
to
amend
the
definition
of
waste
so
that
it 
excepts
substances
produced
by
the
insured’s
wells,
substances
injected
into
the
insured’s
wells,
and 
glycol
used
in
the
insured’s
oil
and
gas
operations. 
Pollution
Liabilities-Additional
Considerations
CGL
policy
coverage
forms
can
differ
from
insurer
to
insurer.
This
means
that
certain
pollution
liabilities 
might
be
excluded
from
coverage
under
certain
CGL
policies.
For
example,
some
CGL
forms
cover 
pollution
cleanup
costs
but
require
legal
liability
for
such
costs.
Other
CGL
forms
cover
first
party 
cleanup
costs
that
are
voluntarily
incurred
and
do
not
require
legal
liability.
Additionally,
some
CGL 
forms
may
exclude
coverage
for
punitive
or
exemplary
damages
arising
from
pollution
liabilities.
In
other 
words,
to
the
extent
that
coverage
exists
for
pollution
claims,
the
policy
may
only
cover
compensatory 
damages. 
Other
CGL
policies
may
exclude
coverage
for
damages
and
costs
associated
with
an
out
of
control
well, 
including
harm
caused
by
seepage
and
pollution
and
costs
for
remedial
clean-up
measures.
If
the
CGL 
policy
has
language
excluding
coverage
for
control
of
well
expenses,
energy
industry
companies
should 
consider
purchasing
an
Operator’s
Extra
Expense/Control
of
Well
(OEE/COW)
insurance
policy.
An 
OEE/COW
policy
provides
coverage
for
costs
that
energy
companies
incur
when
regaining
control
of
a 
well.
Coverage
under
an
OEE/COW
policy
may
include
redrilling
expenses
and
damages
paid
to
third
32parties
for
harm
caused
by
seepage
and
pollution
and
costs
for
remedial
clean-up
measures.
An 
OEE/COW
insurance
policy
might
also
provide
coverage
for
liability
for
damage
to
third-party 
equipment
under
the
operator's
care,
custody
or
control
and
removal
of
wreckage
or
debris. 
Finally,
oil
and
gas
operations
routinely
require
companies
to
be
named
as
additional
insureds.
If
standard 
blanket
additional
insured
endorsements
are
used,
the
additional
insured
will
not
receive
the
benefit
of 
pollution
coverage
under
the
CGL
policy.
Consequently,
blanket
additional
insured
endorsements
will 
need
to
be
modified
to
address
pollution
coverage
for
the
additional
insured. 
Seeking
coverage
for
pollution
liabilities
under
the
limited
coverage
provided
under
the
CGL
policy
is
not 
a
realistic
risk
transfer
technique,
especially
for
gradual,
long-term
pollution
events.
Certain
endorsements 
discussed
in
greater
detail
later
in
this
course
add
limited
coverage
for
pollution
events,
but
these 
endorsements
are
not
sufficient
to
manage
the
types
of
pollution
or
environmental
events
that
can
occur 
from
oil
and
gas
operations.
Therefore,
energy
industry
companies
should
consider
purchasing
pollution 
legal
liability,
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance,
or
other
specialty
environmental
insurance. 
The
use
of
pollution
legal
liability,
contractor’s
pollution
liability,
and
other
specialty
environmental 
insurance
policies
is
warranted
for
a
few
reasons.
First,
coverage
for
pollution
events
arising
from
oil
and 
gas
operations
under
the
CGL
policy
is
limited.
Second,
under
many
oil
and
gas
contracts,
one
party 
contractually
assumes
liability
for
pollution
liabilities,
but
most
pollution
forms
do
not
provide
pollution 
coverage
that
is
contractually
assumed.
One
way
to
get
around
this
problem
is
to
have
contractual
liability 
for
pollution
liabilities
endorsed
on
to
the
policy.
Third,
coverage
for
pollution
liability
under
the
CGL 
policy
might
not
get
triggered
if
the
injury
or
damage
was
not
caused
by
an
accident
or
an
event.
Fourth, 
pollution
exclusions
in
CGL
policies
issued
to
energy
industry
companies
often
contain
a
time
element 
during
which
pollution
must
be
discovered
by
the
insured
and
reported
to
the
insurer.
The
time
element 
can
be
problematic
when
the
claim
involves
gradual,
long-term
pollution.
Fifth,
if
the
pollution
event
is 
“expected
or
intended,”
coverage
under
the
CGL
policy
would
not
exist.
Finally,
most
CGL
policies
do 
not
cover
medical
monitoring
costs.
These
costs
can
arise
for
energy
industry
companies,
especially
those 
companies
involved
in
fracking
operations.
Many
lawsuits
involving
fracking
include
demands
for 
medical
monitoring
for
claimants
whose
drinking
water
is
contaminated,
and
the
insurer
might
take
the 
position
that
absent
actual
bodily
injury
to
claimants,
no
coverage
for
medical
monitoring
exists. 
Pollution
legal
liability
policies
typically
cover
both
first
party
and
third
party
clean-up
costs
as
well
as 
third
party
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
claims.
Furthermore,
pollution
legal
liability
policies 
generally
apply
to
both
gradual
and
sudden
and
accidental
pollution
events.
Pollution
legal
liability 
policies
often
have
broader
coverage
triggers
than
a
CGL
policy
and
coverage
typically
exists
for
certain 
expenses
not
covered
by
CGL
policies,
such
as
medical
monitoring
costs,
natural
resource
damage, 
diminished
value
of
third
party
property,
emergency
response,
evacuation
and
crisis
management 
expenses,
and
direct
business
income
loss
(when
caused
by
a
pollution
event).
Finally,
pollution
legal 
liability
and
specialty
environmental
policies
typically
sit
“excess
and
difference
in
conditions”
to 
underlying
policies
including
the
CGL
and
umbrella
policy.
This
feature
eliminates
any
difficulties
in 
making
“other
insurance”
clauses
work
seamlessly. 
Contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance
covers
pollution
incidents
arising
out
of
the
insured’s
job
site 
operations.
For
example,
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance
may
be
appropriate
for
a
contractor 
who
is
hired
to
install
equipment
at
the
job
site.
Contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance
provides 
coverage
for
first
party
and
third
party
cleanup
costs,
third
party
bodily
injury
and
property
damage, 
defense
costs,
emergency
response
costs,
and
transportation
and
disposal
of
waste
or
materials
from
the 
job
site.
Finally,
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance
can
be
incorporated
into
an
insured’s
pollution 
legal
liability
policy
if,
in
addition
to
performing
services,
the
insured
also
owns
wells,
pipelines,
or
other 
fixed
job
site
assets. 
Aircraft,
Auto,
or
Watercraft
Exclusion
This
exclusion
precludes
coverage
for
injury
or
damage
arising
out
of
the
ownership,
maintenance,
or
use 
of
aircraft,
auto,
or
watercraft.
Liability
arising
out
of
the
loading
or
unloading
of
an
automobile
is
also 
excluded.
These
exposures
are
more
appropriately
covered
under
policies
specifically
designed
to
insure
33them. 
Note
that
the
exclusion
applies
only
to
aircraft,
autos,
or
watercraft
that
are
owned
by,
operated
by,
rented 
to,
or
loaned
to
the
insured.
The
exclusion,
therefore,
does
not
eliminate
coverage
with
respect
to
autos 
owned
and
operated
by
someone
other
than
an
insured,
such
as
a
subcontractor.
This
preserves
coverage 
for
the
insured
contractor’s
derivative
liability
arising
out
of
its
use
of
independent
contractors. 
Five
exceptions
to
the
exclusion
preserve
coverage
for
certain
additional
exposures,
summarized
in 
Exhibit
3.5.
Of
these,
the
exceptions
for
contractually
assumed
liabilities
and
operation
of
specified
types 
of
attached
equipment
are
of
most
importance
for
energy
industry
companies.

Contractual
Liability—Aircraft
or
Watercraft
Recall
that
the
CGL
policy
covers
a
variety
of
contractually
assumed
liabilities.
However,
that
coverage
is 
subject
to
the
rest
of
the
policy’s
terms
and
conditions.
Therefore,
if
liability
arising
out
of
the
use
of
an 
auto,
aircraft,
or
watercraft
is
excluded,
that
applies
to
contractually
assumed
liabilities
for
such
damages 
as
well.
However,
an
exception
to
the
aircraft,
auto,
and
watercraft
exclusion
preserves
coverage
for 
liabilities
arising
out
of
the
use
of
an
aircraft
or
watercraft
only
(not
use
of
an
auto)
that
are
assumed 
under
an
“insured
contract.”
(The
commercial
auto
policy
provides
similar
coverage
for
contractual 
liabilities
arising
out
of
the
use
of
an
auto.) 
An
example
may
be
helpful
in
demonstrating
a
company’s
potential
exposure
to
aircraft
and
watercraft 
liability
and
how
the
CGL
policy
responds
to
these
liabilities.
Assume
a
drilling
contractor
hires
the 
owner
of
a
helicopter
to
airlift
a
drill
from
the
roof
of
the
drill
manufacturer’s
warehouse
to
a
drilling
rig. 
The
helicopter
owner
agrees
in
the
contract
for
services
to
hold
harmless,
defend,
and
indemnify
the 
drilling
contractor
and
manufacturer
from
liability
arising
from
its
operation
of
the
helicopter
in
lifting
the 
drill
from
the
roof
of
the
manufacturer’s
building
to
the
drilling
rig.
In
the
course
of
the
moving
operation, 
the
helicopter
drops
the
drill
,
causing
damage
to
an
adjacent
building
and
several
vehicles
parked
nearby. 
The
helicopter
owner’s
CGL
policy
will
not
respond
to
claims
made
directly
against
him
due
to
the 
aircraft
exclusion.
A
special
aircraft
liability
policy
is
needed
to
cover
that
exposure.
However,
the 
helicopter
owner’s
CGL
will
respond
to
his
obligation
to
indemnify
the
contractor
and
manufacturer
for 
any
claims
made
against
them
for
such
damages
due
to
the
exception
to
the
“aircraft,
autos
and 
watercraft”
exclusion
for
contractually
assumed
liabilities. 
Mobile
Equipment
vs.
Autos
Many
energy
industry
companies
face
a
number
of
liability
exposures
arising
out
of
the
ownership
and 
use
of
mobile
equipment,
such
as
bulldozers,
cranes,
and
backhoes.
Mobile
equipment
exposures
include 
transportation
and
operation
of
the
equipment.
Liability
arising
out
of
the
operational
use
of
many
types 
of
mobile
equipment
is
covered
by
the
CGL
due
to
an
exception
to
the
“auto”
exclusion.
(Liability
arising 
out
of
the
transportation
of
such
equipment
is
largely
excluded.
See
the
discussion
of
the
mobile 
equipment
exclusion
below.) 
The
CGL
policy's
distinction
between
“auto”
and
“mobile
equipment”
is
important
.
While
liability
for 
the
use
or
ownership
of
automobiles
is
excluded,
liability
arising
out
of
the
ownership
or
use
of
mobile 
equipment
is
covered.
Unfortunately,
the
distinction
between
mobile
equipment
and
autos
is
complicated, 
and
some
losses
may
fall
into
the
gray
area
where
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
loss
involves
“mobile 
equipment”
or
an
“auto.” 
The
CGL
policy
defines
“auto”
broadly
as
“a
land
motor
vehicle,
trailer
or
semitrailer
designed
for
travel 
on
public
roads,
including
any
attached
machinery
or
equipment.”
This
definition
(and
thus
the
auto 
exclusion)
is
broad
enough
to
include
many
types
of
equipment
energy
industry
companies
use
in
their
35operations  if it were not for a specific statement  that “mobile equipment”  will not be considered  an
“auto.” (The CGL and commercial  auto policies use the same definition  of “mobile  equipment,”  which 
allows their coverages  to dovetail precisely.)  The definition  of “mobile  equipment”  thus determines  where 
coverage does and does not exist with respect to such equipment.
The CGL policy defines “mobile equipment”  to include items that have some features of an auto, such as 
wheels and an engine, but that are not typically used in the capacity of an automobile.  Tractors, forklifts, 
cranes, and graders are just a few examples  of “mobile  equipment.”  These items are used more like tools 
and machinery,  and the risks they impose are more in line with machinery  and tools than with those 
presented  by automobiles.  Therefore,  they are more appropriately  insured under the general liability 
policy than under the auto policy.
Mobile equipment  includes items that are incapable  of operation  on public roads (e.g., heavy construction  
cranes), items that are designed for use off public  roads but can nevertheless  be driven on public roads
(tractors, bulldozers),  and items that would ordinarily  be considered  “autos” except that they are used 
exclusively  in off-road activities (e.g., a crane that is used exclusively  on a drilling contractor’s  rig). This 
blend of features and uses results in blended auto and mobile equipment  exposures.  For example,  a truck 
registered  and used on public roads presents an auto-type  exposure when it is traveling on public roads. 
However,  if that truck has permanently  attached equipment,  it presents more of an operations  exposure 
(general liability) when the vehicle is stationary  and the equipment  is in use.
To keep coverage for each of these exposures  in the most suitable place, coverage is split between the 
auto policy and the CGL policy based on how the vehicle/equipment  is being used at the time of the loss. 
By an exception  to the auto exclusion,  coverage applies to the operation  of certain  types of permanently  
mounted equipment,  which means the operations  exposure is covered under the CGL even if the unit as a 
whole is classified  as an auto. For example,  if a pickup with a permanently  attached welding apparatus  is 
involved in an automobile  accident, the insured’s automobile  policy will respond, and this loss is 
excluded under the CGL policy (due to the “auto” exclusion).  If, on the other hand, negligent use of the 
welding equipment  results in a fire, the insured’s CGL policy will respond due to the mobile equipment  
exception  to the auto exclusion.  Avoiding  coverage disputes over how the policy should respond to these 
types of losses is a good reason to place an energy industry company’s  automobile  and general liability 
coverages  with the same insurer whenever  feasible.
Mobile Equipment  Exclusion
Although  the CGL policy provides coverage with respect to “mobile equipment,”  an exclusion  does apply 
with respect to the transportation  of such equipment.  When mobile equipment  is being transported  by 
truck or other vehicle, the liability risks associated  with the equipment  are highly similar to the risks 
associated  with using an automobile;  therefore,  coverage is provided under the auto policy rather than the 
CGL policy. The mobile equipment  exclusion  prevents the argument  that a given accident involving  an 
auto carrying mobile equipment  actually arose out of the mobile equipment  and should therefore be 
covered.
Specifically,  the mobile equipment  exclusion  of the CGL policy removes coverage for liability  arising out 
of the transportation  of mobile  equipment  while being transported  by an auto “owned, operated by, rented 
or loaned to” the insured. Transportation  of mobile equipment  by a hired mover or independent  
subcontractor,  however, is not excluded as long as the vehicle transporting  the equipment  is not owned, 
operated, rented, or loaned to the insured. This preserves  the insured company’s  coverage for when it is 
sued based on the actions of its independent  contractors.
The exclusion  also eliminates  coverage under the policy while covered equipment  is being used in a 
racing, speed, or demolition  contest, or stunting  activities.  No exceptions  apply to this portion of the 
exclusion.
War Exclusion
While prior versions of the CGL excluded only contractual  liabilities arising out of war activities,  the 
current version of the exclusion  is nearly absolute in its application.  The war exclusion  in the current
36standard
CGL
policy
precludes
coverage
for
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising
out
of
the
following 
three
categories
of
war
risks. 
•
War
itself,
including
undeclared
war
and
civil
war
•
Other
warlike
action
undertaken
by
a
military
force
•
Insurrection,
rebellion,
revolution,
and
usurped
power,
including
governmental
action
to
counter 
any
of
these
Damage
to
Property
Exclusion
Recall
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
CGL
Coverage
A
is
to
provide
coverage
for
third-party
bodily 
injury
and
property
damage.
That
is,
the
policy
intends
to
cover
the
insured
company’s
liability
for 
damages
suffered
by
others
as
a
result
of
the
insured’s
negligence.
Understandably,
therefore,
the
policy 
does
not
cover
damage
to
the
insured’s
own
property.
Nor
does
it
cover
damage
to
certain
other
types
of 
property
where
the
risks
are
more
representative
of
first-party
property
than
third-party
property,
such
as 
premises
that
the
energy
industry
company
rents
or
leases.
A
close
look
at
the
“damage
to
property” 
exclusion
will
reveal
some
problems
that
show
why
first-party
property
insurance
is
the
only
way
to 
obtain
comprehensive
coverage
for
certain
categories
of
property. 
The
“damage
to
property”
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
six
categories
of
property,
which
are
listed
in 
Exhibit
3.6.
Each
of
these
categories
is
discussed
briefly
below.

•
“That

Property
Owned/Rented/Occupied
by
the
Insured
The
first
category
of
property
addressed
under
the
“damage
to
property”
exclusion
is
property
owned, 
rented,
or
occupied
by
the
insured.
These
types
of
property
are
more
appropriately
covered
through 
first-party
insurance
policies
(e.g.,
a
building
and
personal
property
policy). 
Alienated
Premises
Also
excluded
is
property
damage
that
arises
out
of
any
part
of
premises
that
are
sold,
given
away,
or 
abandoned
by
the
insured.
The
intent
of
this
exclusion,
which
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
“alienated 
premises”
exclusion,
is
to
remove
coverage
for
the
costs
of
correcting
any
known
defects
in
the
premises 
prior
to
selling
it.
(Note
that
this
part
of
the
exclusion
applies
only
to
property
damage;
bodily
injury 
arising
from
such
premises
and
property
damage
to
property
other
than
the
actual
premises
are
not 
addressed
in
the
exclusion.) 
By
exception,
this
exclusion
does
not
apply
if
the
premises
in
question
are
the
named
insured’s
work
and 
were
never
occupied,
rented,
or
held
for
rental
by
the
named
insured. 
Borrowed
Property
The
damage
to
property
exclusion
precludes
coverage
for
damage
to
property
loaned
to
the
energy 
industry
company.
This
part
of
the
exclusion
would
eliminate
coverage
for
damage
to
tools
or
equipment 
the
company
borrows
from
another
party.
Coverage
for
borrowed
property
can
often
be
arranged
under
a 
separate
contractors
equipment
insurance
policy
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
or
rigs
and
equipment 
insurance
policy. 
Personal
Property
Damage
to
personal
property
in
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
any
insured
is
also
excluded.
The
keys
to 
interpreting
this
exclusion
are
defining
what
constitutes
personal
property
and
what
constitutes
“care, 
custody
or
control”
of
that
property.
Personal
property
is
not
defined
in
the
policy,
so
it
takes
on
its 
normal
legal
meaning,
which
is
any
property
other
than
real
property.
Real
property,
by
definition, 
includes
land,
buildings,
and
certain
items
permanently
attached
to
such
property. 
The
more
problematic
element
of
this
exclusion
is
what
constitutes
being
in
an
insured’s
“care,
custody
or 
control.”
Recall
that
risk
under
most
oil
and
gas
contracts
is
usually
transferred
to
one
party
regardless
of 
fault,
and,
in
some
instances,
the
contracts
contain
carve-outs
which
require
one
party
to
take
direct 
responsibility
and
release
the
other
party
from
certain
risks.
For
example,
under
a
drilling
contract,
the 
operator
takes
direct
responsibility
for
damage
to
the
drilling
rig
and
damage
to
downhole
tools
due
to 
unsound
location.
Assume
that
roustabouts
damage
an
amine
unit
while
installing
it
for
an
operator. 
Damage
to
the
amine
unit
would
not
be
covered
because
it
was
in
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
the 
operator.
Similarly,
damage
to
the
drilling
rig
caused
by
the
operator’s
well
service
contractor
would
not 
be
covered
if
the
drilling
rig
was
in
the
operator’s
care,
custody,
and
control
at
the
time
such
damage
took
38place.
Given
the
unique
way
risk
is
allocated
under
oil
and
gas
contracts,
the
CGL
and
umbrella
policies 
cannot
always
be
relied
upon
to
provide
coverage
for
large
property
exposures.
Consequently,
operators 
should
consider
purchasing
specialty
insurance
such
as
rigs
and
equipment
coverage
or
OEE/COW 
insurance
for
such
exposures. 
Property
on
Which
the
Insured
or
its
Contractor
Is
Working
The
fifth
type
of
excluded
damage
to
property
applies
only
to
operations
being
performed
on
real 
property.
(As
noted
above,
real
property
includes
land,
buildings,
and
certain
items
permanently
attached 
to
such
property.)
If
the
insured’s
operations
result
in
damage
to
real
property,
there
is
no
coverage
for 
damage
to
“that
particular
part”
of
the
property
on
which
the
operations
were
being
performed
at
the
time 
of
the
loss.
(The
requirement
that
the
operations
are
in
progress
at
the
time
the
loss
occurs
renders
this 
portion
of
the
exclusion
inapplicable
to
completed
operations
losses.) 
The
phrase
“that
particular
part”
is
intended
to
define
precisely
what
is
covered
(i.e.,
resulting
damage
to 
other
property)
and
what
is
not
covered
(i.e.,
the
faulty
work
or
the
item
being
worked
on
at
the
time
of 
the
loss). 
Faulty
Workmanship
The
sixth
and
last
category
under
the
“damage
to
property”
exclusion
is
frequently
referred
to
as
a
“faulty 
workmanship”
exclusion.
Under
this
part
of
the
exclusion,
coverage
is
eliminated
for
property
damage
to 
“that
particular
part”
of
property
that
must
be
repaired
or
replaced
because
the
insured’s
work
was 
“incorrectly
performed”
on
it.
(Unlike
in
the
previous
section
of
the
exclusion,
this
portion
of
the 
exclusion
is
not
limited
to
damage
to
real
property.)
The
purpose
of
this
exclusion
is
to
eliminate 
coverage
for
the
insured’s
bad
work.
Most
insurers
would
argue
that
to
cover
poor
workmanship
would 
be
a
disincentive
for
insureds
to
be
diligent
in
the
quality
of
their
work.
By
specific
exception,
the 
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
losses
that
are
included
in
the
“products
and
completed
operations
hazard,” 
which
limits
its
application
to
damage
arising
out
of
ongoing
operations.
(Coverage
for
damage
to 
completed
work
is
the
subject
of
a
separate
exclusion,
which
is
discussed
below.) 
Damage
to
“Your
Product”
Exclusion
The
damage
to
“your
product”
exclusion
eliminates
coverage
for
property
damage
to
the
named
insured’s 
product
arising
out
of
that
product
or
any
portion
of
it.
This
exclusion
is
intended
to
apply
only
to 
manufacturers
and
other
entities
that
produce
“products”
rather
than
service
companies
such
as
operators 
and
drilling
contractors.
The
damage
to
“your
work”
exclusion,
which
applies
to
completed
operations,
is 
of
much
greater
significance
to
operators,
drilling
contractors,
and
well
service
contractors. 
Damage
to
“Your
Work”
Exclusion
While
several
CGL
exclusions
pertain
to
completed
operations
losses,
the
“damage
to
your
work” 
exclusion
is
by
far
the
most
important
in
defining
the
scope
of
completed
operations
coverage.
This 
exclusion
specifically
states
that
it
applies
only
to
liability
arising
out
of
the
“products-completed 
operations
hazard,”
which
limits
its
application
to
completed
work.
The
“damage
to
property”
exclusion, 
discussed
above,
addresses
coverage
for
damage
to
work
in
progress. 
The
purpose
of
the
“damage
to
your
work”
exclusion
is
to
prevent
the
CGL
policy
from
functioning
as
a 
warranty
of
the
insured’s
work.
It
provides
that
Coverage
A
does
not
apply
to
damage
to
“‘your
work’ 
arising
out
of
it
or
any
part
of
it
and
included
in
the
‘products-completed
operations
hazard.’”
A
casual 
reading
of
this
language
may
appear
to
render
completed
operations
coverage
virtually
worthless,
at
least 
with
respect
to
damage
to
the
work
itself.
Nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
Significant
completed 
operations
coverage
is
retained
in
the
exception
to
the
exclusion.
Specifically,
the
exclusion
does
not 
apply
if
the
damaged
work
or
the
work
out
of
which
the
damage
arises
was
performed
by
a
subcontractor. 
Coverage
is
thus
preserved
for
damage
to
a
subcontractor’s
work
and
damage
caused
by
a
subcontractor’s 
work. 
The
only
property
damage
to
completed
work
that
is
not
covered,
therefore,
is
damage
to
the
insured 
company’s
own
work
that
is
the
result
of
that
work.
For
this
reason,
the
exclusion
is
frequently
referred
to
39as
the
“workmanship”
exclusion. 
“Impaired
Property”
Exclusion
The
purpose
for
including
the
“impaired
property”
exclusion
in
the
CGL
policy
was
to
address
“passive 
defects”
due
to
the
presence
of
defective
products
or
defective
work.
A
passive
defect
is
one
that
has
not 
yet
failed
but
that
presents
an
increased
risk
of
failure
in
the
future.
For
example,
a
defective
blade
by
one 
manufacturer
is
incorporated
into
another
manufacturer’s
wind
turbine.
The
defect
does
not
directly 
(“actively”)
damage
the
property,
but
its
incorporation
renders
the
property
less
useful
or
valuable,
or 
makes
it
necessary
to
undertake
extensive,
and
potentially
destructive
alteration
of
the
property
in
order
to 
repair
or
replace
the
defective
product.
Specifically,
the
exclusion
eliminates
coverage
for
claims
alleging 
loss
of
use
arising
out
of
the
mere
incorporation
of
a
defective
component
into
another
piece
of
property 
or
defective
work
into
a
product
or
into
a
building
or
structure.
The
exclusion
goes
on
to
stipulate
that 
such
physical
injury—even
though
it
constitutes
"property
damage"—is
not
covered
if
it
meets
the 
conditions
set
up
by
the
"impaired
property"
definition. 
The
CGL
policy
uses
a
two-prong
test
to
determine
if
property
is
“impaired
property.”
First,
there
must
be 
tangible
property
other
than
“your
product”
or
“your
work”
that
cannot
be
used
or
is
less
useful
because 
“your
product”
or
“your
work”
is
incorporated
into
the
property.
Second,
the
property
can
be
restored
to 
use
by
the
repair
or
replacement
of
“your
product”
or
“your
work.”
When
both
of
these
conditions
are 
met,
the
property
is
deemed
“impaired
property”
and
thus
excluded
under
the
CGL
policy. 
"Impaired
property"
can
be
created
not
only
by
the
incorporation
of
the
insured's
defective
product
into 
other
property,
but
also
by
the
failure
of
the
insured
to
fulfill
a
contract.
The
most
obvious
application
of 
this
part
of
the
exclusion
involves
losses
when
an
insured
manufacturer
supplies
defective
components
to 
another
manufacturer.
The
defect
may
be
discovered
before
incorporation
of
the
insured's
product
has 
taken
place
yet
still
result
in
loss
to
the
other
manufacturer,
who
is
left
with
an
inventory
of
partially 
completed
products
that
lack
one
necessary
component.
If
replacement
components
cannot
be
easily 
acquired—or
cannot
be
acquired
at
all—the
other
manufacturer
incurs
loss
of
use
of
its
inventory
because 
of
the
insured
manufacturer's
failure
to
deliver
components
in
fulfillment
of
its
contract.
If
the
items
of 
the
other
manufacturer's
inventory
can
be
restored
to
use
(i.e.,
if
they
can
be
assembled
and
marketed
as 
intended)
given
the
insured's
delivery
of
nondefective
components,
then
the
inventory
represents
impaired 
property.
If
fulfillment
of
the
insured's
contractual
obligation
would
not
restore
the
inventory
to
use—if, 
for
instance,
a
critical
time
factor
governed
the
manufacturing
process
and
that
time
had
passed—then
the 
inventory
is
not
impaired
property. 
This
application
of
the
exclusion
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
the
CGL
policy
is
not
intended
to
cover 
the
cost
of
repairing
or
replacing
the
faulty
product
or
the
faulty
work.
By
exception
to
the
exclusion, 
coverage
is
retained
for
loss
of
use
that
is
the
result
of
sudden
and
accidental
physical
injury
to
“your 
product”
or
“your
work”
after
it
has
been
put
to
its
intended
use,
which
preserves
coverage
for
damages 
that
are
caused
by
the
actual
failure
of
the
defective
work,
as
opposed
to
the
mere
risk
of
failure. 
“Your
Product”
and
Breach
of
Contract
While
our
discussion
of
the
impaired
property
exclusion
has
centered
on
the
issue
of
damage
arising
out 
of
“your
work,”
it
is
worthwhile
to
make
a
few
general
observations
on
the
other
parts
of
the
exclusion. 
First,
materials
and
supplies
that
are
furnished
by
the
insured
company
in
connection
with
their
work
are 
included
in
the
policy’s
definition
of
“your
work.”
Thus,
the
incorporation
of
bad
piping
into
an
oil 
pipeline
project
falls
under
the
“your
work”
aspect
of
the
exclusion,
as
opposed
to
“your
product.”
Most 
energy
companies,
therefore,
will
not
be
impacted
by
the
“your
product”
portion
of
the
exclusion. 
A
second
part
of
the
exclusion
eliminates
coverage
for
“delay
or
failure
by
you
or
anyone
acting
on
your 
behalf
to
perform
a
contract
or
agreement
in
accordance
with
its
terms.”
This
exclusion
negates
coverage 
for
loss
of
use
claims
arising
out
of
the
insured’s
failure
to
meet
its
deadlines,
among
other
things.
For 
example,
a
drilling
contractor
agrees
to
rig
up
and
start
drilling
a
well
by
a
specific
date
and
fails
to
do
so. 
The
operator
loses
the
mineral
lease
because
of
the
drilling
contractor’s
delay
and
sues
the
drilling 
contractor,
alleging
the
drilling
contractor’s
failure
to
drill
the
well
by
a
specific
date
constituted
a
breach 
of
contract.
The
drilling
contractor’s
CGL
policy
would
not
cover
this
claim.
40Recall
of
Products,
Work,
or
Impaired
Property
This
clause,
commonly
known
as
the
“sistership”
or
“products
recall”
exclusion,
precludes
coverage
for 
damages
incurred
if
the
named
insured’s
“product,
work,
or
property
is
withdrawn
or
recalled
from
the 
market
or
from
use”
because
of
a
“known
or
suspected
defect,
deficiency,
inadequacy
or
dangerous 
condition
in
it.”
Its
origin
derives
from
the
aircraft
industry
where
a
major
accident
with
one
type
of
plane 
would
prompt
the
recall
of
every
other
plane
of
that
make
(its
“sisterships”). 
Personal
and
Advertising
Injury
The
personal
and
advertising
injury
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
bodily
injury
that
arises
out
of 
“personal
and
advertising
injury.”
Coverage
for
personal
and
advertising
injury
is
the
subject
of
the
CGL 
policy’s
Coverage
B.
To
avoid
duplication,
coverage
for
any
consequential
damages
arising
out
of
a 
bodily
injury
is
excluded
under
Coverage
A. 
Electronic
Data
The
electronic
data
exclusion
eliminates
coverage
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
“loss
of,
loss
of
use
of, 
damage
to,
corruption
of,
inability
to
access,
or
inability
to
manipulate
electronic
data.”
This
exclusion, 
added
to
the
policy
in
December
2004,
is
somewhat
redundant
to
the
policy’s
provision
that
“electronic 
data
is
not
tangible
property,”
which
disqualifies
it
for
coverage
by
removing
it
from
the
definition
of 
“property
damage.”
However,
this
exclusion
can
result
in
serious
consequences
for
energy
industry 
companies.
Cyber
exposures
have
become
common
in
the
energy
industry
and
these
exposures
can
affect 
energy
industry
control
systems
as
opposed
to
business
applications
or
email.
In
fact,
at
least
four
United 
States
oil
companies
have
been
infected
by
the
Stuxnet
virus.
The
virus
is
used
to
take
control
of
a 
particular
model
of
Programmable
Logic
Controller
(PLC)
manufactured
by
Siemens.
The
virus 
subsequently
sets
up
communications
with
a
remote
server
computer
that
can
be
used
to
take
control
of 
the
PLC
system
or
to
steal
proprietary
corporate
data.
For
example,
the
Stuxnet
virus
could
infect
an
oil 
pipeline’s
PLC,
ultimately
shutting
down
the
pipeline
or
could
infect
an
offshore
drilling
rig,
ultimately 
leading
to
an
oil
spill.
In
2010,
the
virus
targeted
uranium
enrichment
centrifuges
used
by
Iran
in
its 
nuclear
enrichment
facilities,
was
able
to
reconfigure
the
centrifuge
drive
controllers,
and
caused
the 
equipment
to
slowly
self-destruct. 
The
energy
industry
is
vulnerable
to
more
than
just
the
Stuxnet
virus.
Oil
and
gas
companies
in
the
U.S. 
are
the
frequent
targets
of
cyber-attacks
by
hackers
who
are
looking
to
access
trade
secrets,
such
as 
strategic
plans,
bids
for
new
drilling
projects,
geological
data,
and
information
about
private
negotiations 
with
foreign
officials.
To
put
this
in
perspective,
from
approximately
2008
to
2011,
many
U.S.
oil
and
gas 
firms
were
invaded
by
the
“Night
Dragon,”
a
series
of
cyber
intrusions
by
hackers
located
in
China
with 
the
purpose
of
stealing
highly
confidential
and
proprietary
information
about
oil
and
gas
field
operations, 
financial
transactions,
and
bidding
data.
Moreover,
the
energy
industry’s
increasing
reliance
on
digital 
technology
has
resulted
in
process
control
automation
systems
that
contain
vast
amounts
of
highly 
sensitive
information
that
are
vulnerable
to
cyber
threats.
Finally,
new
federal
and
state
legislation
related 
to
cyber-risk
disclosures
and
privacy
breaches
have
resulted
in
increased
cyber
liability
exposures
for 
energy
industry
companies. 
Since
the
electronic
data
exclusion
establishes
that
electronic
data
is
not
tangible
property,
an
energy 
industry
company’s
CGL
policy
will
not
respond
to
third-party
loss
exposures
associated
with
a 
cyber-attack.
Many
insurance
companies
now
offer
policies
specifically
designed
to
provide
coverage
for 
both
first-party
and
third-party
cyber
risks.
Consequently,
operators,
drilling
contractors
and
other
energy 
industry
companies
should
evaluate
whether
their
existing
insurance
programs
adequately
cover
cyber 
security-related
risks,
and
whether
to
purchase
a
specialized
insurance
policy
to
cover
cyber
risks.

CGL
Coverages
B
and
C
For
energy
industry
companies,
Coverage
A,
discussed
in
detail
in
Chapters
2
and
3,
is
by
far
the
most 
important
coverage
of
the
CGL
policy.
Chapter
4
deals
more
briefly
with
the
CGL’s
other
two
main 
coverages: 
•
Coverage
B
of
the
CGL
expands
the
policy’s
scope
of
coverage
to
include
“personal
and 
advertising
injury”
liability;
these
terms
are
described
further
in
this
chapter.
•
Coverage
C
reimburses
the
medical
expenses
incurred
by
members
of
the
general
public
who
are 
injured
on
the
insured
company’s
premises
or
because
of
the
firm’s
operations.
Because
benefits 
under
this
coverage
are
paid
regardless
of
the
insured’s
legal
liability,
it
is
not
truly
a
liability 
coverage.
42Learning
Objectives
In
this
chapter,
you
will
learn
how
to…
1.
Differentiate
“bodily
injury”
from
“personal
injury”
and
explain
where 
coverage
for
each
may
be
found
in
a
standard
CGL
policy.
2.
Determine
whether
or
how
Coverage
B
of
the
CGL
would
respond
to 
various
types
of
claims.
3.
Identify
the
criteria
that
must
be
met
for
a
medical
payments
loss
to
be 
covered
and
determine
whether
they
have
been
met
in
a
given
situation.
4.
Recognize
why
medical
expense
coverage
is
provided
on
a
no-fault 
basis.
Coverage
B—Personal
and
Advertising
Injury
Coverage
B
of
the
CGL
expands
the
policy’s
scope
of
coverage
to
include
“personal
and
advertising 
injury”
liability.
The
policy’s
definition
of
“personal
and
advertising
injury”
cites
a
number
of
different 
types
of
offenses
that
may
produce
covered
damages.
The
key
offenses
that
trigger
coverage
for
personal 
and
advertising
injury
are
outlined
in
Exhibit
4.1. 
43Exhibit
4.1
 
Personal
and
Advertising
Injury
•
False
arrest,
detention,
or
imprisonment
•
Malicious
prosecution
•
Wrongful
eviction
•
Wrongful
entry
•
Invasion
of
privacy
•
Libel
or
slander
of
a
person,
organization,
product,
or
service
•
Advertising
infringement
•
Copyright
infringement
in
advertisements
•
Consequential
“bodily
injury”
arising
out
of
any
of
the
above
offenses
The
offenses
listed
in
Exhibit
4.1
are
given
their
normal
legal
meaning.
For
example,
Black’s
Law 
Dictionary
(5th
ed.)
defines
malicious
prosecution
as
one
“begun
in
malice
without
probable
cause
to 
believe
the
charges
can
be
sustained.”
Likewise,
libel
is
defined
as
“a
method
of
defamation
expressed
by 
print,
writing,
pictures,
or
signs.” 
Although
many
attorneys
tend
to
use
the
term
“personal
injury”
to
include
“bodily
injury,”
the
CGL 
policy
makes
a
clear
distinction
between
the
two.
Although
both
types
of
injury
are
covered,
they
are 
separate
sections
of
the
policy,
with
different
insuring
agreements,
different
exclusions,
different
limits
of 
insurance,
and
other
variations
in
coverage.
Note
that
bodily
injury
that
occurs
as
a
consequence
of 
“personal
and
advertising
injury”
is
covered
under
Coverage
B
rather
than
under
Coverage
A,
which
is 
where
the
policy’s
primary
coverage
for
bodily
injury
is
found.
This
is
consistent
with
Coverage
A’s 
exclusion
for
such
damages. 
Advertising
infringements
include
the
inappropriate
use
of
another’s
copyright,
logo,
slogan,
etc.,
in
the 
insured’s
advertisements,
as
well
as
misappropriation
of
another’s
advertising
ideas.
It
does
not
cover 
other
forms
of
copyright
infringement,
such
as
the
use
of
copyrighted
design
documents
without
the 
copyright
holder’s
permission.
Internet
publishing
and
advertising
is
covered
the
same
as
in
more 
traditional
media.
For
example,
the
definition
of
“advertisement”
includes
“material
placed
on
the
Internet 
or
on
similar
electronic
means
of
communication.”
As
a
result,
operators,
drilling
contractors,
and
other 
energy
industry
companies
have
coverage
for
liability
arising
out
of
activities
such
as
the
posting
of
ad 
banners
on
a
website. 
Key
elements
of
personal
and
advertising
injury
coverage
are
discussed
below. 
Insuring
Agreement
The
Coverage
B
insuring
agreement
makes
promises
similar
to
those
found
in
the
Coverage
A
insuring 
agreement.
That
is,
it
sets
forth
the
insurer’s
promise
to
pay
sums
that
the
insured
becomes
legally 
obligated
to
pay
as
damages
because
of
personal
and
advertising
injury
that
is
covered
by
the
policy.
It 
also
states
the
insurer’s
obligation
to
defend
the
insured.
Other
key
elements
required
to
trigger
coverage 
are
outlined
in
Exhibit
4.2. 
44Exhibit
4.2
 
Elements
of
a
Covered
Loss—Personal
and
Advertising
Injury
Liability
(Coverage
B)
•
Covered
“personal
and
advertising
injury”
•
Insured
has
a
legal
obligation
to
pay
damages
to
a
third
party
•
Damages
were
caused
by
an
offense
arising
out
of
the
insured’s
business
•
The
offense
took
place
in
the
“coverage
territory”
during
the
“policy
period”
One
key
difference
in
the
Coverage
A
and
Coverage
B
insuring
agreements
is
the
event
that
triggers 
coverage.
While
Coverage
A
is
triggered
by
an
“occurrence,”
the
events
that
trigger
Coverage
B
are 
referred
to
as
offenses.
The
concept
of
an
“occurrence”
is
inappropriate
to
Coverage
B,
since
the
CGL 
policy
defines
an
occurrence
as
an
“accident.”
The
actions
of
an
insured
that
might
give
rise
to
a
personal 
and
advertising
injury
claim
are
very
seldom
accidental.
For
example,
the
events
that
give
rise
to
a
claim 
based
on
libel,
slander,
copyright
infringement,
invasion
of
privacy,
etc.,
are
generally
intentional
acts. 
Even
though
the
injury
itself
may
not
be
intended
by
the
insured,
there
would
be
coverage
problems
in 
providing
personal
and
advertising
injury
on
an
“occurrence”
basis.
For
this
reason,
the
term
“offense”
is 
used
in
lieu
of
“occurrence”
to
designate
the
event
out
of
which
a
personal
and
advertising
injury
claim 
arises. 
Exclusions
Coverage
B
contains
16
exclusions,
which
are
listed
in
Exhibit
4.3.
Many
of
these
exclusions
pertain
to 
offenses
that
were
committed
with
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
they
violate
the
rights
of
another.
Criminal 
acts
committed
at
the
direction
of
the
insured
are
likewise
excluded.
The
two
key
exclusions
with
specific 
application
to
the
energy
industry
are
the
contractual
liability
exclusion
and
the
pollution
exclusion.

Intentional
Injuries
Coverage
B
does
not
require
that
the
act
that
produces
the
injury
be
an
unintentional
act.
On
the
contrary, 
as
noted
previously,
the
requirement
that
there
be
an
offense,
as
opposed
to
an
accident,
is
based
on
the 
notion
that
many
of
the
actions
that
produce
personal
and
advertising
injuries
will
be
intentional
acts. 
However,
if
the
person
who
commits
the
act
does
so
with
an
understanding
that
it
will
almost
certainly 
produce
an
injury,
the
CGL
policy
will
not
respond.
Thus,
it
is
the
intentionality
of
the
injury,
rather
than 
the
act
that
produces
the
injury,
that
triggers
the
exclusion.
Two
of
the
Coverage
B
exclusions
fall
into
the 
category
of
“intentional
injury”—knowing
violation
of
another’s
rights
and
publishing
materials
the 
insured
knows
to
be
false. 
Publishing
Activities
Several
of
the
Coverage
B
exclusions
are
designed
to
remove
coverage
with
respect
to
a
variety
of 
publishing
risks.
With
the
exception
of
the
insured’s
own
advertisements,
liability
arising
out
of 
publishing
activities
is
largely
excluded.
An
even
broader
exclusion
for
such
offenses
applies
to
insureds 
whose
primary
business
is
as
a
publisher,
broadcaster,
advertiser,
or
telecaster.
Specialty
coverages
are 
available
to
insure
these
exposures,
which
constitute
professional
liability
exposures
for
such
businesses. 
Various
attempts
have
been
made
to
obtain
coverage
for
the
misappropriation
of
intellectual
property
by 
arguing
that
advertising
something
that
someone
else
legally
owns
the
rights
to
constitutes
“advertising 
injury.”
For
example,
if
a
drilling
contractor
uses
data
or
techniques
that
are
the
proprietary
property
of
a 
competitor,
the
mere
advertisement
of
the
use
of
such
techniques
does
not
constitute
advertising
injury. 
Only
when
the
advertisement
itself
constitutes
an
infringement
of
another’s
copyright,
slogan,
etc.,
will 
Coverage
B
respond. 
Personal
and
advertising
injury
is
unique
in
that
it
can
arise
out
of
a
single
act
that
is
or
has
been
repeated 
many
times.
Print
or
broadcast
advertisements,
for
example,
may
run
in
various
media
dozens
or
hundreds 
of
times
over
a
period
of
months
or
even
years.
The
exclusion
for
materials
first
published
prior
to
the 
policy
period
eliminates
coverage
for
injury
that
arises
out
of
material
that
is
first
published
before
the 
policy
took
effect,
even
if
the
particular
publication
giving
rise
to
the
claim
occurs
during
the
policy
46period. 
Internet-Related
Exclusions
The
ownership,
hosting,
or
supervision
of
Internet
chat
rooms
and
bulletin
boards
(websites
where 
participants
may
post
messages
and
opinions
on
a
variety
of
topics)
presents
a
significant
risk
of
libel, 
slander,
and
invasion
of
privacy
claims.
Rather
than
factor
this
increased
risk
into
basic
CGL
rates,
when 
a
large
majority
of
insureds
do
not
need
the
coverage,
the
risk
is
simply
excluded. 
Attempts
to
misdirect
Internet
users
to
a
website
by
creating
domain
names
and
Web
addresses
that
are 
similar
to
names
associated
with
more
well-known
or
more
reputable
companies
could
result
in
claims
of 
copyright
infringement
or
trade
dress,
or
even
criminal
charges. 
Criminal
Acts
The
exclusion
for
liability
arising
out
of
a
criminal
act
applies
only
to
the
insured
that
committed
the 
criminal
act.
Coverage
is
preserved
with
respect
to
the
vicarious
liability
of
an
innocent
insured.
The 
exclusion
does
not
require
that
the
criminal
act
be
willful,
intentional,
or
malicious
to
be
excluded. 
Contractual
Liability
As
with
Coverage
A,
contractually
assumed
liabilities
are
excluded,
but
unlike
Coverage
A,
there
is
no 
exception
for
liabilities
assumed
in
“insured
contracts.”
Consequently,
the
energy
industry
company
has 
no
coverage
for
contractually
assumed
liability
for
personal
injuries.
Given
the
proclivity
of
many 
attorneys
to
use
the
term
“personal
injury”
instead
of
“bodily
injury”
in
indemnity
clauses,
energy 
industry
companies
may
be
assuming
liabilities
for
which
they
have
no
coverage.
One
solution
to
this 
problem
is
to
convince
the
drafters
of
the
contract
to
use
the
term
“bodily
injury”
instead
of
“personal 
injury”
in
the
indemnity
provision.
In
that
way,
the
company’s
liability
is
matched
to
its
insurance 
coverage.
Deleting
the
Coverage
B
contractual
liability
exclusion
is
an
alternative
method
of
avoiding
this 
uninsured
exposure
if
the
underwriter
will
agree
to
this
modification. 
Breach
of
Contract
With
one
exception,
this
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
personal
and
advertising
injury
that
arises
from 
a
breach
of
contract
in
the
insured’s
advertisement.
(Claims
for
breach
of
contract
with
respect
to 
activities
other
than
advertising
do
not
trigger
coverage;
therefore,
the
exclusion
would
not
even
come 
into
play.)
The
exception
applies
where
contractual
obligations
and
advertising
injury
exposures
could 
potentially
overlap,
such
as
where
a
dispute
arises
over
express
or
implied
contractual
rights
to
use 
another’s
idea.
When
a
breach
of
contract
claim
is
brought
against
the
insured
in
these
circumstances,
the 
exclusion
does
not
interfere
with
coverage. 
Failure
To
Meet
Performance
and
Price
Guarantees
Personal
and
advertising
injury
coverage
is
not
intended
to
function
as
a
guarantee
of
either
quality
or 
price.
Energy
industry
companies
have
no
coverage
for
claims
that
they
failed
to
deliver
the
promised 
quality
of
product
or
service.
Likewise,
errors
in
cost
estimates
or
other
types
of
price
differentials
are
not 
covered
damages. 
Pollution
Under
prior
versions
of
the
CGL
policy,
a
number
of
pollution
liability
claims
that
were
clearly
excluded 
under
Coverage
A
were
successfully
pursued
under
Coverage
B
on
the
basis
that
the
spread
of
pollutants 
onto
another’s
property
constituted
trespass
or
wrongful
entry
onto
another’s
premises.
To
avoid
this
type 
of
claim,
which
clearly
misconstrues
the
coverage
intent,
a
pollution
exclusion
was
incorporated
into 
Coverage
B.
The
exclusionary
language
is
essentially
absolute
in
effect. 
Pollution
claims
alleging
trespass
and
wrongful
entry
onto
another’s
premises
are
more
common
than
you 
might
think.
For
example,
the
owners
of
a
mineral
estate
(“estate
owners”)
enter
into
a
mineral
lease
with 
an
operator,
and
the
operator
commences
oil
and
gas
operations
on
a
mineral
estate
known
as
A-24. 
During
onshore
oil
drilling,
the
operator
develops
an
excess
wastewater
problem
on
an
adjacent
mineral
47lease
it
owns
(A-16),
hindering
production
of
the
operator’s
oil
and
gas
on
that
property.
The
operator 
ultimately
determines
that
the
best
solution
to
the
problem
would
be
to
inject
the
wastewater
into
A-24 
under
the
mineral
lease.
This
action
contaminates
the
A-24
estate
owners’
property.
The
estate
owners
sue 
the
operator,
alleging
that
the
operator
committed
a
trespass
by
discharging
the
excess
wastewater
on
to 
their
property
and
the
contamination
caused
by
the
trespass
interfered
and
damaged
the
wells
in
the
estate 
owners’
property.
If
a
court
concludes
that
the
injection
of
excess
wastewater
spread
pollutants
onto
the 
A-24
estate
owners’
property
and
constituted
a
trespass,
the
Coverage
B
pollution
exclusion
would
bar 
coverage
for
the
claim.
Similarly,
a
group
of
oil
and
gas
operators
construct
and
operate
pits,
wells, 
sumps,
pipelines,
flow
lines,
tank
batteries,
well
heads,
and
injection
wells
as
part
of
their
drilling 
operations.
Operation
of
these
items
results
in
spillage
or
disposal
of
toxic
oilfield
wastes,
causing 
pollution
damage
on
property
that
is
adjacent
to
the
mineral
lease.
The
landowners
sue
the
operators, 
alleging
that
the
disposal
of
toxic
oilfield
wastes
on
their
property
was,
among
other
things,
a
trespass.
If 
a
court
concludes
the
spillage
or
disposal
of
toxic
oilfield
wastes
was
a
trespass,
the
pollution
exclusion 
would
bar
coverage
for
the
oil
and
gas
operators’
claim. 
Also
excluded
under
coverage
B
are
the
costs
of
complying
with
any
request,
demand,
or
order
to 
ascertain
the
extent
of
contamination,
if
any,
or
to
remediate
pollutants,
by
the
government
or
otherwise. 
Likewise,
governmental
claims
for
damages
for
amounts
spent
for
these
types
of
activities
are
excluded. 
However,
depending
on
the
jurisdiction,
coverage
for
these
claims
may
be
found
under
Coverge
A.
War
Personal
and
advertising
injury
coverage
is
subject
to
a
broad
war
exclusion
identical
to
the
one
that 
applies
to
Coverage
A.
Injury,
however
caused,
arising
directly
or
indirectly
out
of
war,
warlike
action
by 
a
military
force,
and
other
forms
of
insurrection
is
excluded. 
Recording
and
Distribution
of
Material
or
Information
in
Violation
of
Law
This
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
injury
arising
out
of
the
violation
of
various
federal
and
state
laws 
aimed
at
regulating
so-called
junk
faxes
and
e-mails.
For
example,
the
Telephone
Consumer
Protection 
Act
of
1991
prohibits
sending
unsolicited
advertisements
to
a
fax
machine,
and
similar
restrictions
were 
imposed
on
the
use
of
e-mail
for
marketing
purposes
by
the
Controlling
the

Coverage
C—Medical
Payments
Coverage
C
reimburses
medical
expenses
incurred
by
members
of
the
general
public
who
are
injured
on 
the
insured
company’s
premises,
or
because
of
the
firm’s
operations.
This
coverage
pays
without
regard 
to
legal
liability.
If,
for
example,
a
customer
is
injured
in
the
lobby
of
the
operator’s
business
office,
the 
CGL
insurer
will
pay
for
reasonable
medical
expenses
incurred
regardless
of
whether
the
contractor
is 
legally
liable
for
the
injury.
For
coverage
to
apply,
injuries
must
be
reported
within
1
year
of
the
accident.
The
rationale
for
this
“no
fault”
coverage
is
that
injured
parties
may
be
less
inclined
to
sue
if
their 
immediate
medical
expenses
are
taken
care
of.
Because
the
objective
of
this
coverage
is
to
reduce
claims 
under
Coverage
A,
injuries
that
would
not
trigger
coverage
for
“bodily
injury”
under
Coverage
A
are
not 
compensable
under
Coverage
C.
For
example,
if
the
injury
was
the
result
of
an
intentional
act,
no 
coverage
would
be
available
under
Coverage
A;
consequently,
no
coverage
is
available
under
Coverage 
C,
either.

Supplementary Payments
• Investigation and defense costs
• Bond costs
• Up to $250 for bail bonds required as a result of an accident or violation involving the use of a
vehicle to which Coverage A applies, such as mobile equipment
• Cost of bonds to release attachments that have been made on the insured’s assets. The
insurer’s maximum obligation for such bond costs is the cost of a bond with a value equal to
the policy limit
• Expenses incurred by the insured at the insurer’s request as part of its investigation or
defense of the claim, including up to $250 a day for loss of earnings
• Costs and fees assessed against the insured in the suit, such as court costs
• Prejudgment interest awarded against the insured
• Postjudgment interest that accrues between the award date and the payment of damages

52arising
from
harm
to
the
drilling
contractor’s
property
or
personnel
but
not
its
contractors
or 
subcontractors. 
Under
a
broad
form
of
reciprocal
indemnity,
each
party
accepts
responsibility
for
loss
to
its
own
people 
and
property
and
for
the
people
and
property
of
its
contractors
and
subcontractors.
For
example,
a
drilling 
contract
with
a
broad
reciprocal
indemnity
clause
would
require
the
operator
to
indemnify
the
drilling 
contractor,
and
the
drilling
contractor’s
subcontractors
and
sub-subcontractors,
from
claims
arising
out
of 
injury,
illness,
death,
loss
or
damage
to
property
of
the
operator’s
property
or
own
employees
and
its
own 
contractors’
and
subcontractors’
employees
and
property.
Correspondingly,
the
drilling
contractor
would 
be
required
to
indemnify
the
operator,
and
the
operator’s
contractors
and
subcontractors,
from
claims 
arising
out
of
injury,
illness,
death,
loss
or
damage
to
property
of
the
drilling
contractor’s
property
and
its 
own
employees
and
its
own
contractors’
and
subcontractors’
employees
and
property.
Under
this
form
of 
reciprocal
indemnity,
the
parties
may
make
the
protections
more
or
less
broad.
For
example,
some
broad 
reciprocal
indemnity
provisions
include
“joint
venturers,”
"customers,"
"clients,"
"invitees,"
or
others. 
Finally,
a
modified
form
of
reciprocal
indemnity
exists
which
is
a
hybrid
of
the
narrow
and
broad
models. 
In
one
version
of
modified
reciprocal
indemnity,
one
party
accepts
responsibility
only
for
loss
to
its
own 
people
and
property
and
extends
that
protection
to
the
indemnitee
as
well
as
its
contractors
and 
subcontractors.
The
other
party,
however,
indemnifies
a
broad
group
of
indemnitees
for
loss
to
the 
indemnitor's
own
people
and
property,
as
well
as
the
people
and
property
of
its
contractors
and 
subcontractors. 
In
order
for
the
reciprocal
indemnity
scheme
to
work,
oil
and
gas
contracts
often
contain
“pass-through” 
indemnity
provisions,
under
which
the
indemnitor
is
required
to
assume
the
indemnitee’s
own 
indemnification
obligations
to
other
parties
(such
as
the
indemnitee’s
contractors
or
subcontractors).
In 
other
words,
the
contract
includes
a
mechanism
for
ensuring
that
a
party
like
an
operator
is
entitled
to 
indemnity
protection
from
its
contractors,
such
as
an
equipment
service
contractor,
that
can
be
passed 
through
to
the
drilling
contractors
or
other
contractors
who
are
entitled
to
indemnity.
A
common
way
that 
“pass-through”
indemnity
provisions
are
created
is
to
define
the
categories
of
entities
and
individuals
to 
whom
indemnity
protections
flow
under
the
applicable
contract.
This
often
happens
by
broadening
the 
universe
of
indemnitees
to
include
the
contracting
parties’
affiliates,
partners,
owners,
agents,
contractors, 
and
subcontractors.
These
entities
and
individuals
are
often
defined
as
the
“Operator
Group”
and
the 
“Contractor
Group.”
By
defining
these
groups,
the
parties
effectively
create
pass-through
protection
for 
those
indemnitees.
Exhibit
5.2
illustrates
how
indemnity
flows
under
a
pass-through
protection. 
There
are
certain
exceptions
to
the
reciprocal
indemnity
scheme
discussed
above
that
have
a
significant 
impact
on
risk
allocation.
These
exceptions
typically
apply
to
“all
claims
arising
out
of’
a
particular
event 
or
circumstance. 
Furthermore,
the
knock
for
knock
indemnity
approach
does
not
address
claims
for
injuries
or
damages
to 
true
third
parties,
i.e.,
nonparties
to
the
contract
and
other
entities
that
are
not
included
within
the
breadth 
of
the
indemnity.
This
may
include
governmental
agents,
neighboring
land
owners,
passersby,
and
even 
trespassers.
For
the
most
part,
both
drilling
contractors
and
operators
expect
that
responsibility
for
claims 
by
true
third
parties
will
remain
“at
law.”
Some
drilling
contractors,
however,
seek
to
shift
responsibility 
for
all
third-party
claims
to
the
operator
regardless
of
fault,
arguing
that
the
operator’s
return
on
the 
drilling
operation
justifies
this
shift
of
responsibility.
Operators,
on
the
other
hand,
typically
oppose
that 
type
of
broad
shift
because,
as
relates
to
claims
by
third
parties
due
to
the
drilling
contractor’s
fault,
the 
operator
has
no
control
over
either
the
drilling
contractor’s
methods
or
the
tort
victim
and
thus
may
not
be 
able
to
insure
the
risk.
However,
for
work
that
does
not
involve
exploration
and
production
(e.g.,
work 
that
does
not
involve
a
common
multiemployer
work
site),
use
of
ownership-based
risk
allocation
is 
generally
not
appropriate.
When
one
employer
(e.g.,
a
contractor)
controls
the
entire
work
site
and
all 
personnel
at
that
site,
the
difficultly
of
allocating
fault
lessens
and
the
benefits
of
allocating
risk
without 
regard
to
fault
are
greatly
reduced.
For
example,
ownership-based
risk
allocation
is
usually
not 
appropriate
in
construction
contracts
since
the
general
contractor
usually
has
complete
control
of
the
job 
site.
Under
that
scenario,
risk
is
transferred
“downstream,”
with
the
project
owners
at
the
top
of
the 
construction
chain,
followed
by
the
general
contractor,
and
various
tiers
of
subcontractors.
As
previously
53noted,
the
topic
of
indemnity
and
contractual
risk
transfer
in
energy
industry
contracts,
including
“pass 
through”
indemnity
provisions
and
certain
carve-outs
to
knock
for
knock
indemnity,
will
be
covered
in 
greater
detail
in
a
separate
course. 
Louisiana,
Texas,
New
Mexico,
and
Wyoming
have
oil
field
anti-indemnity
acts
that
invalidate,
based
on 
public
policy
grounds,
indemnity
provisions
that
exculpate
parties
from
damages
or
losses
caused
by
the 
indemnified
party’s
own
fault.
Additionally,
most
states
place
some
limits,
either
by
statute
or
through
the 
courts,
on
the
scope
of
allowable
indemnity.
Most
commonly,
they
forbid
or
severely
restrict
the
transfer 
of
liability
for
one’s
sole
negligence
in
construction
contracts
and
motor
carrier
transportation
contracts. 
Some
states
prohibit
any
transfer
of
liability
for
one’s
own
negligence,
such
as
when
the
parties
are
jointly 
liable
for
the
loss. 
As
discussed
previously
with
regard
to
contractual
liability
coverage,
the
CGL
policy
covers
liabilities 
assumed
in
an
indemnity
provision.
However,
whether
insurers
are
required
to
provide
a
defense
to
the 
insured
contractor’s
indemnitee
has
been
a
subject
of
debate.
The
prevalent
practice
among
general 
liability
insurers
is
to
provide
a
defense
for
their
insureds’
indemnitees
in
conjunction
with
the
defense 
provided
to
the
insured.
In
most
cases,
the
same
cause
of
action
will
involve
a
claim
against
the
insured 
company
and
its
indemnitee,
which
makes
mounting
a
defense
for
both
parties
not
only
practicable
but 
also
prudent.
Since
the
CGL
insurer
will
probably
be
responsible
for
any
damages
awarded
against
the 
indemnitee
(because
of
the
insured’s
contractual
obligation
to
pay
those
damages),
most
insurers
provide 
the
indemnitee
with
a
defense
simply
as
a
way
of
protecting
their
own
interests. 
The
current
edition
of
the
CGL
policy
provides
that
if
certain
conditions
are
met,
a
duty
to
defend
an 
indemnitee
is
created,
and
defense
costs
are
payable
as
supplementary
payments
outside
the
policy
limit. 
These
conditions
are
summarized
in
Exhibit
5.2.
However,
if
any
of
the
conditions
is
not
met,
there
is
no 
duty
to
defend,
and
the
indemnitee’s
defense
costs
are
payable
under
the
contractual
liability
coverage
as 
damages.
(Both
of
these
scenarios
assume
the
contract
in
which
liability
for
these
amounts
was
assumed 
is
an
“insured
contract.”) 
54Exhibit
5.2
 
Requirements
for
Triggering
a
Duty
To
Defend
Indemnitees
•
The
insured
operator,
drilling
contractor,
well
service
contractor,
independent
contractor,
or 
company
has
specifically
agreed
in
an
“insured
contract”
to
assume
the
liability
on
which
the 
suit
is
based,
including
the
indemnitee’s
defense
costs.
•
The
liability
assumed
in
the
hold
harmless
agreement
must
be
of
a
kind
covered
by
the 
policy.
In
other
words,
if
the
damages
would
not
be
payable
as
a
direct
claim
against
the 
insured,
they
are
also
not
covered
as
a
contractual
liability.
•
The
insured
operator,
drilling
contractor,
well
service
contractor,
independent
contractor,
or 
company
and
the
indemnitee
are
both
named
in
the
suit.
•
There
is
no
apparent
conflict
of
interests
between
the
insured
indemnitor
and
its
indemnitee.
•
The
request
for
a
defense
is
made
by
both
the
insured
and
the
indemnitee,
and
both
parties 
agree
to
have
the
same
counsel
provide
a
defense.
•
The
indemnitee
agrees
to
cooperate
with
the
insurer
in
defending
the
suit
(just
as
the
insured 
agrees
to
do
in
the
policy’s
basic
conditions)
and
to
provide
records
and
documents
related 
to
the
suit.
•
The
indemnitee
must
agree
to
notify
any
other
insurer
whose
policy
may
be
triggered
by
this 
claim
and
to
cooperate
in
coordinating
such
other
coverage.
Clearly,
it
is
to
both
parties’
advantage
(the
indemnitee’s
as
well
as
the
insured
indemnitor’s)
for
defense 
costs
to
be
payable
as
supplementary
payments
as
it
avoids
the
erosion
of
limits
available
to
pay
claims. 
Unfortunately,
a
couple
of
the
conditions
for
qualifying
for
coverage
under
the
supplementary
payments 
provision
are
problematic
for
energy
industry
companies. 
First,
the
duty
to
defend
arises
only
when
the
insured
and
the
indemnitee
are
both
named
in
the
suit.
A 
number
of
circumstances
can
give
rise
to
a
suit
against
the
indemnitee
(e.g.,
operator)
in
which
the 
insured
(e.g.
drilling
contractor)
itself
is
not
a
defendant.
By
far,
the
most
common
such
circumstance
is
a 
third-party-over
action,
in
which
a
suit
is
brought
against
the
indemnitee
by
an
employee
of
the
insured 
indemnitor.
In
that
instance,
the
injured
employee
collects
workers
compensation
benefits
and
is
barred 
from
pursuing
further
action
against
the
indemnitor/employer.
The
employee
can,
however,
file
a
suit 
against
the
indemnitee
alleging
some
form
of
negligence,
such
as
failure
to
warn
of
known
dangers.
If 
that
happens,
the
indemnitee
will
normally
look
to
the
indemnitor
for
a
defense
(as
well
as
coverage
for 
damages)
in
conjunction
with
the
hold
harmless
provision
in
the
oil
and
gas
contract. 
This
scenario
is
played
out
frequently
on
oil
and
gas
projects
in
a
way
that
is
different
from
other 
industries.
For
example,
an
operator
hires
a
casing
company
to
perform
work
on
a
well.
The
casing 
company’s
employee
is
injured,
collects
workers
compensation
benefits
from
the
casing
company
and 
sues
the
operator
and
the
drilling
contractor.
The
operator
sought
indemnity
from
the
casing
company
for 
its
percentage
of
fault
for
the
employee’s
injuries
pursuant
to
its
contract
with
the
casing
company.
The 
operator
also
has
an
indemnity
agreement
with
the
drilling
company
which
required
the
operator
to
pay 
the
drilling
company’s
percentage
of
fault
for
the
employee’s
injuries.
Consequently,
the
operator
sought 
indemnity
from
the
casing
company
for
the
contractual
liability
owed
to
the
drilling
contractor.
If
the 
applicable
contracts
contained
“pass-through”
indemnity
provisions,
the
casing
company
would
be 
responsible
for
indemnifying
the
operator
for
the
contractual
liability
owed
to
the
drilling
contractor.
If 
the
applicable
contracts
did
not
contain
“pass-through”
indemnity
provisions,
the
operator
would
owe 
indemnity
to
the
drilling
contractor
for
the
casing
company’s
employee’s
injuries
but
would
not
have
the 
ability
to
rely
on
the
indemnity
from
the
casing
company
to
satisfy
that
obligation. 
Therefore,
failing
to
include
a
pass-through
indemnity
provision
in
even
one
contract
between
an
operator 
and
its
contractors
could
create
a
significant
uninsured
exposure.
Consequently,
energy
industry 
professionals
often
broaden
the
group
of
indemnitees
to
include
the
contracting
parties’
affiliates, 
partners,
owners,
agents,
contractors,
and
subcontractors
(e.g.,
Operator
Group
and
Contractor
Group). 
Parties
also
address
“pass
through”
liability
by
removing
the
word
“tort”
from
the
definition
of
“Insured 
Contract,”
thereby
eliminating
the
“tort”
liability
requirement
from
the
definition.
Using
the
example
55discussed
above,
because
the
casing
company
is
not
also
named
in
the
suit
against
the
operator
and 
drilling
contractor
(nor
can
it
be),
the
duty
to
defend
is
not
triggered
under
the
CGL
policy.
Coverage
in 
this
case
would
revert
to
defense
costs
being
covered
as
damages
(as
opposed
to
outside
of
policy
limits) 
as
provided
by
the
differing
contractual
treatment
of
defense
costs
as
an
exception
to
the
Supplementary 
Payments
provision
for
Coverage
A.
If
the
defense
costs
plus
any
damages
that
are
eventually
awarded 
against
the
indemnitee
exceed
the
available
policy
limit,
the
casing
company
is
left
holding
the
bag
for
the 
remainder.
(The
casing
company’s
obligation
to
indemnify
remains
even
if
there
is
no
insurance
to
cover 
the
obligation.)
In
this
event,
the
loss
would
need
to
be
handled
by
excess
or
umbrella
limits
available
to 
the
insured,
which
may
involve
another
insurer. 
A
second
problem
is
the
duty
imposed
on
the
indemnitee
to
notify
its
own
insurer
of
the
suit
and
to 
cooperate
in
coordinating
coverage
with
that
other
insurer.
In
other
words,
the
casing
company’s
CGL 
insurer
clearly
contemplates
some
form
of
contribution
toward
the
indemnitee’s
defense
costs
from
the 
indemnitee’s
own
CGL
insurer.
Indemnitees
require
indemnification
provisions
precisely
because
they
do 
not
want
their
own
policies
to
have
to
respond
to
claims
arising
out
of
indemnitors’
actions
or
operations. 
Yet
that
is
what
the
CGL
policy
requires
to
trigger
a
duty
to
defend
under
the
supplementary
payments 
section
of
the
policy.
Timely
notice
and
response
from
all
potentially
affected
insurers,
both
primary
and 
excess,
is
most
important. 
As
it
is
written,
the
CGL
approach
to
providing
coverage
for
defense
of
an
indemnitee
falls
far
short
of 
ideal.
As
a
matter
of
practice,
most
insurers
have
heretofore
provided
energy
industry
companies’ 
indemnitees
with
a
defense.
Since
the
insurer
is
obligated
for
any
damages
awarded,
its
own
interests
are 
best
served
in
this
manner.
However,
additional
insured
status
is
a
much
more
reliable
method
of 
guaranteeing
access
to
a
defense
under
an
indemnitor’s
liability
policy.
Additional
insured
status
is 
discussed
in
greater
detail
later
in
this
course.

CGL:
Who
Is
an
Insured
(Section
II)
In
addition
to
the
person
or
entity
listed
on
the
policy
as
the
named
insured,
the
CGL
policy
automatically 
provides
coverage
for
various
other
persons
or
entities.
While
it
would
not
be
beneficial
to
grant
insured 
status
to
just
anyone,
where
certain
legal
or
contractual
relationships
exist,
it
makes
sense
to
do
so.
The 
“Who
Is
an
Insured”
section
stipulates
who
automatically
qualifies
for
insured
status
under
the
CGL 
policy. 
57Learning
Objectives
In
this
chapter,
the
student
will
learn
how
to…
1.
Determine
whether
a
given
party
has
insured
status,
and
is
therefore 
covered,
in
a
given
situation.
2.
Differentiate
between
the
rights
of
a
named
insured,
an
automatic 
insured,
and
an
additional
insured
under
the
standard
CGL
policy.
Exhibit
6.1
summarizes
the
CGL’s
“who
is
a
insured”
provision.
In
most
instances,
an
individual’s
or 
organization’s
status
as
an
insured
is
limited
to
liability
that
results
directly
from
the
described 
relationship
with
the
named
insured
energy
industry
company.

Automatic
Insureds
In
addition
to
the
named
insured,
the
following
persons
or
entities
are
automatically
provided 
insured
status
under
the
CGL
policy.
Limitations
may
apply
as
to
the
extent
of
coverage
certain 
insureds
are
afforded.

Automatic

days,
unless
the
newly
acquired
organization
is
a
partnership,
joint 
venture,
or
limited
liability
company.
The
application
of
various
policy
provisions
is
directly
influenced
by
the
policy’s
use
of
references
to
the 
various
insureds.
Numerous
CGL
policy
provisions
refer
to
the
named
insured
(by
definition,
the
terms 
“you”
and
“your”
refer
to
the
named
insured),
and
others
use
the
terms
“an
insured”
or
“the
insured.” 
These
distinctions
can
be
crucial
in
defining
coverage.
For
example,
an
exclusion
that
applies
to
property 
in
“your”
care,
custody,
or
control
will
not
apply
to
an
additional
insured
because
“your”
is
defined
in
the 
policy
to
refer
only
to
the
named
insured.
If
that
same
exclusion
applied
to
property
in
“the
insured’s” 
care,
custody,
or
control,
it
would
apply
equally
to
claims
against
the
named
insured
for
property
in
its 
control
and
claims
against
an
additional
insured
for
property
in
its
control.
A
third
possibility
is
that
an 
exclusion
might
apply
to
property
in
“an
insured’s”
care,
custody,
or
control.
In
that
instance,
it
would
not 
matter
who
the
claim
is
against
or
which
insured
had
control
of
the
property—the
exclusion
is
categorical 
rather
than
situational
in
that
instance. 
Family
and
Business
Relationships
A
variety
of
familial
or
business
relationships
may
earn
individuals
insured
status.
Generally
speaking, 
these
individuals
are
provided
insured
status
due
to
certain
legal
obligations
imposed
on
them
as
a
result 
of
the
relationship.
For
example,
a
spouse
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
liabilities
of
the
other
spouse. 
Similarly,
members
of
a
partnership
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
obligations
of
the
other 
partners. 
As
respects
a
partnership
or
a
joint
venture,
the
entity
itself
is
an
insured
as
well
as
any
partner
or
member 
of
the
entity
and
their
spouses.
However,
individuals
are
only
covered
for
their
liability
in
a
partnership
or 
joint
venture
that
is
listed
as
the
named
insured.
No
person
or
entity
is
covered
for
liability
arising
out
of
59their
involvement
in
a
current
or
past
partnership,
joint
venture,
or
limited
liability
company
(LLC)
that
is 
not
listed
as
a
named
insured
in
the
declarations. 
When
the
named
insured
is
an
organization
other
than
a
partnership
or
joint
venture
(i.e.,
corporation, 
association,
etc.),
the
entity
itself,
as
well
as
any
executive
officers,
directors,
or
stockholders
are 
insureds.
Those
individuals
having
coverage
under
this
provision
are
insured
only
with
respect
to
their 
duties
as
officers
or
directors.
Stockholders
are
insureds
to
the
extent
they
may
be
held
liable
as 
stockholders. 
Employees
The
named
insured’s
employees
and
volunteer
workers
are
insureds
under
the
CGL
policy
for
liability 
arising
out
of
their
employment
activities.
The
policy’s
definition
of
“employee”
includes
leased
workers 
but
does
not
extend
to
temporary
workers.
Providing
coverage
for
employees
as
well
as
for
the
corporate 
entity
has
several
potential
benefits.
First,
it
may
assist
in
attracting
and
retaining
quality
employees. 
Second,
it
increases
the
likelihood
of
employee
cooperation
in
defending
a
claim
that
names
both
the 
individual
employee
and
the
corporation.
However,
several
restrictions
are
placed
on
the
scope
of 
coverage
employees
and
volunteers
receive.
(The
limitations
described
below
apply
to
volunteers
as
well 
as
employees.) 
First,
employees
have
no
coverage
with
respect
to
injuries
sustained
by
the
named
insured,
its
partners
or 
members,
or
another
employee
or
volunteer.
(This
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
suits
against
executive 
officers.)
The
exclusion
also
removes
coverage
for
claims
filed
by
others
as
a
result
of
an
injury
to 
another
employee
or
volunteer,
such
as
a
spouse
or
child
of
the
injured
worker.
The
primary
purpose
of 
this
“fellow
employee”
exclusion,
as
it
is
commonly
called,
is
to
avoid
creating
a
“loophole”
that
allows 
employees
to
circumvent
the
exclusive
remedy
doctrine
in
the
workers
compensation
law
by
suing
a 
coworker
who
caused
or
contributed
to
the
injury. 
Second,
employees
have
no
coverage
with
respect
to
any
professional
liability
arising
out
of
providing
or 
failing
to
provide
professional
healthcare
services.
For
example,
if
an
operator
employs
a
registered
nurse 
to
run
a
first
aid
treatment
center
at
drilling
sites,
that
nurse
is
not
covered
under
the
contractor’s
CGL 
policy
for
the
provision
of
medical
treatment.
This
exclusion
only
applies
to
the
medical 
professionals—the
insured
operator
is
covered
for
its
liability
arising
from
these
medical
services. 
Finally,
employees
are
not
insureds
with
respect
to
property
damage
to
the
property
that
is
owned, 
occupied,
used
by,
rented
to,
or
in
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
the
named
insured,
the
partners
or 
members
who
own
the
company,
or
other
employees. 
While
there
is
logic
and
equity
behind
these
limitations,
they
can
also
create
problems.
As
the 
effectiveness
of
the
“exclusive
remedy”
aspect
of
workers
compensation
has
been
eroded
over
time, 
lawsuits
against
fellow
employees
have
become
more
common,
particularly
with
regard
to
safety
and 
security
personnel
and
mid-level
supervisory
employees
such
as
foremen.
Most
employees
will
have
no 
coverage
for
such
suits
if
it
is
not
provided
by
the
employer.
Even
if
the
suit
is
ultimately
unsuccessful, 
the
employee
may
incur
substantial
uninsured
legal
expense.
For
this
reason,
some
energy
industry 
companies
attempt
to
modify
the
co-employee
injury
limitation
to
preserve
insured
status
for
certain 
employees
with
respect
to
fellow-employee
suits.
See
the
discussion
of
“injury
to
fellow
employee” 
endorsements
later
in
this
course. 
Legal
Representatives
The
CGL
policy
provides
insured
status
to
two
categories
of
legal
representatives.
First,
in
the
event
of 
the
named
insured’s
death,
both
temporary
custodians
and
legal
representatives
of
the
deceased
become 
insureds
with
respect
to
their
liabilities
and
duties
in
those
capacities.
Second,
any
person
or
organization 
acting
as
the
named
insured’s
real
estate
manager
is
an
insured. 
Newly
Acquired
Organizations
Organizations
formed
or
acquired
by
the
named
insured
during
the
policy
period
automatically
have
90 
days
of
coverage
under
the
CGL
policy.
This
coverage
is
intended
to
provide
for
the
incidental
exposure
60when
a
newly
acquired
or
newly
formed
organization
may
be
without
insurance
protection
for
a
short 
period
of
time.
It
is
not
intended
to
pick
up
liability
for
losses
that
already
existed
prior
to
the
acquisition. 
To
reinforce
this
intention,
injury
or
damage
that
occurred
before
the
acquisition
or
formation
of
the 
organization
is
specifically
excluded
from
this
coverage
extension.
This
exclusion
eliminates
the 
possibility
of
acquiring
coverage
for
liability
that
has
already
been
incurred
simply
by
being
acquired
by 
another
organization
that
has
CGL
coverage.
To
further
emphasize
this
intent,
the
policy
provides
that
the 
automatic
coverage
extension
does
not
apply
if
the
acquired
organization
had
similar
insurance
that
would 
apply
to
the
loss,
regardless
of
whether
the
limits
of
liability
of
those
policies
are
adequate. 
The
automatic
coverage
applies
only
if
the
named
insured
owns
at
least
a
majority
interest
in
the 
company,
and
the
new
entity
is
not
a
partnership,
joint
venture,
or
LLC.
(Coverage
is
available
to 
partnerships,
joint
ventures,
and
LLCs
only
if
they
are
listed
on
the
policy
as
named
insureds.
This 
condition
can
pose
significant
coverage
problems,
especially
in
large
organizations
where
some
joint 
ventures
might
not
be
reported
to
the
insurance
agent
or
risk
manager.)
Beyond
90
days,
the
new
firm 
must
be
specifically
added
to
the
policy
to
avoid
an
interruption
in
coverage. 
Additional
Insureds
It
is
common
among
parties
to
sophisticated
oil
and
gas
contracts
to
assess
the
risks
associated
with
their 
contractual
activities
and
allocate
those
risks
through
a
combination
of
indemnification
provisions
and 
insurance
requirements.
With
respect
to
insurance
requirements,
oil
and
gas
contracts
may
require
one 
party,
such
as
the
operator,
to
add
other
parties
(i.e.,
the
drilling
contractor
and
its
affiliated
companies)
to 
their
liability
policies
as
“additional
insureds”
when
one
party
has
agreed
to
indemnify
another. 
Additional
insured
status
provides
the
indemnified
party
with
several
benefits.
First,
it
allows
the 
indemnitee
to
place
the
indemnitor’s
CGL
policy
in
front
of
the
indemnitee’s
own
policy,
and,
as
a
result, 
protects
the
indemnitee’s
CGL
policy
limits.
Second,
an
additional
insured
is
a
direct
party
to
the 
insurance
contract
whereas
an
indemnitee
is
not
a
direct
party
to
the
insurance
contract.
Consequently, 
additional
insureds
have
the
rights
of
an
insured,
including
the
right
to
a
defense
and,
in
certain
cases, 
indemnity
from
the
insurer,
and
the
right
to
file
a
claim
directly
against
the
policy.
Further,
defense
costs 
constitute
supplementary
payments
that
are
outside
the
policy
limit,
which
may
not
be
the
case
when 
filing
a
claim
for
indemnity
under
the
policy’s
contractual
liability
coverage.
(See
the
“Defense
of 
Indemnitees”
discussion
above.)
Moreover,
additional
insured
status
significantly
augments
the
total 
amount
of
coverage
available
for
a
particular
loss
or
series
of
losses.
Finally,
sometimes
indemnity 
obligations
are
not
valid
due
to
oilfield
anti-indemnity
acts
but
insurance
required
under
the
contract
is 
still
valid.
For
example,
Louisiana
courts
have
created
a
judicial
exception
to
the
Louisiana
Oilfield 
Anti-Indemnity
Act,
which,
if
applicable,
does
not
invalidate
the
additional
insured
protection.
In
order 
for
the
exception
to
be
applicable,
all
material
costs
of
extending
additional
insured
protection
must
be 
paid
by
the
indemnitee.
Texas
courts
have
also
created
a
judicial
exception
to
the
Texas
Oilfield 
Anti-Indemnity
Act,
which
allows
insurance
protection
under
policies
that
do
not
directly
support
an 
invalid
indemnity
agreement. 
Additional
insureds
are
added
by
endorsement
on
either
a
scheduled
basis
or
a
blanket
basis.
Under
a 
scheduled
approach,
only
those
persons
or
entities
that
are
listed
by
name
on
the
endorsement
are 
additional
insureds.
Under
an
automatic
or
“blanket”
endorsement,
additional
insureds
are
added
by
virtue 
of
meeting
the
parameters
for
such
status
specified
in
the
endorsement,
such
as
“anyone
who
requires 
such
status
in
a
contract
with
you.” 
The
scope
of
coverage
provided
to
an
additional
insured
is
dictated
by
the
terms
of
the
endorsement,
as 
well
as
the
rest
of
the
policy
provisions.
However,
the
unique
risk
allocation
system
in
oil
and
gas 
contracts
has
an
impact
on
the
appropriate
scope
of
coverage
for
additional
insureds.
The
appropriate 
scope
of
coverage
for
oil
and
gas
additional
insureds
is
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
Chapter
8
of
this 
course. 
There
are
standard
endorsements
for
adding
nonoperating
working
interest
owners,
contractors,
and
other 
designated
persons
or
organizations
as
additional
insureds.
Furthermore,
there
is
a
nonstandard 
endorsement
for
adding
owners
of
gas
and
oil
lease
working
interests
as
additional
insureds.
The
61exposures
that
these
endorsements
cover
are
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
Chapter
8
of
this
course.

CGL
Limits
of
Insurance
(Section
III)
and 
Policy
Conditions
(Section
IV)
Policy
limits
in
the
CGL
are
somewhat
complex.
After
examining
the
way
in
which
the
CGL
deals
with 
policy
limits,
which
appear
in
Section
III
of
the
CGL,
this
chapter
provides
an
overview
of
the
policy 
conditions
that
appear
in
Section
IV.
This
course
emphasizes
the
provisions
most
directly
relevant
to 
energy
industry
companies.

In
this
chapter,
you
will
learn
how
to…
1.
recognize
the
relationships
among
the
CGL’s
various
types
of
policy
limits 
in
the
CGL,
and
identify
the
types
of

to
which
each
limit
applies.
2.
Identify
the
function
of
each
CGL

condition

recognize
how
the
CGL’s
other
insurance
condition
affects
the
way
in 
which
more
than
one
policy
that
provides
coverage
will
respond
to
a
loss.
Limits
of
Insurance
The
CGL
policy
contains
six
different
limits
of
insurance,
summarized
in
Exhibit
7.1.
The
aggregate 
policy
limits
apply
separately
to
each
consecutive
year
the
policy
is
in
force.
Thus,
with
each
renewal,
the 
insured
company
has
a
fresh
set
of
limits
with
respect
to
claims
that
occur
during
that
policy
period. 
Remember,
however,
that
claims
filed
during
the
current
policy
period
may
actually
be
payable
under 
previous
policies
if
the
actual
“bodily
injury”
or
“property
damage”
is
deemed
to
have
occurred
during 
their
coverage
periods.
With
respect
to
“personal
and
advertising
injury,”
the
policy
triggered
is
the
one 
that
was
in
force
when
the
offense
was
committed.
Thus,
the
limit
of
coverage
that
is
actually
available 
will
be
the
stated
policy
limit
of
the
triggered
policy,
unless
any
claims
that
have
already
been
paid
under 
that
policy
have
eroded
the
general
aggregate
limit. 
Several
of
these
limits
are
actually
sublimits
that
also
reduce
the
amount
payable
under
another
limit.
For 
example,
losses
arising
out
of
the
same
“occurrence”
are
subject
to
a
collective
maximum
and
reduce
the 
aggregate
amount
of
coverage
remaining
for
claims
arising
out
of
other
occurrences.
If
other
claims
have 
eroded
the
general
aggregate
limit
or
products
and
completed
operations
aggregate
limit,
the
insurer
is 
liable
for
a
maximum
of
the
difference
between
the
applicable
aggregate
limit
and
the
amount
already 
paid
under
that
limit.
Likewise,
losses
paid
under
Coverage
C—medical
payments—are
subject
to
a 
maximum
amount
per
person,
but
these
payments
also
reduce
the
amount
left
in
the
per
occurrence
limit 
for
other
claims
arising
out
of
the
same
occurrence.

insureds
to

The
general

completed

can
be
different
amounts,
but
unless
otherwise
stated,
the
same
per

applies
to
both

The
application
of
the
CGL
policy
limits
is
illustrated
in 
Exhibit

For
the
purpose
of
clarity
in
this
example,
the
“each
occurrence”
limit
is
shown
separately
for 
products-completed
operations
and
premises-operations.
While
the
general
policy
aggregate
and 
the
products-completed
operations
aggregate
can
be
different
in
amount,
the
policy
is
arranged
so 
that
the
each
occurrence
limit
will
usually
be
the
same
amount
for
both
coverages.
Products-Completed
Operations
Hazard
Completed
operations
coverage
is
a
very
important
component
of
an
energy
industry
company’s 
insurance
program.
While
coverage
for
certain
completed
operations
is
automatically
provided
under 
Coverage
A,
it
is
distinguished
from
the
other
types
of
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
liability, 
primarily
premises
and
operations
losses.
Losses
that
fall
under
the
completed
operations
hazard
are 
subject
to
different
treatment
in
the
application
of
certain
exclusions
as
well
as
different
policy
limits.
(A 
standard
endorsement
is
available
for
the
purpose
of
removing
completed
operations
coverage
for
oil,
gas, 
and
other
mineral
products
completed
operations.
Companies
should
avoid
such
an
exclusion
if
at
all 
possible,
as
it
represents
a
substantial
loss
of
coverage.) 
The
“products-completed
operations
hazard”
definition
merely
stipulates
when
a
project
shifts
from
being 
an
operation
in
progress
to
being
a
completed
operation.
Once
a
project
meets
the
definition
of
a 
completed
operation,
coverage
is
governed
by
the
appropriate
completed
operations
provisions,
including 
the
products
and
completed
operations
aggregate
limit. 
To
simplify,
the
key
elements
of
a
“completed
operations”
hazard
are
summarized
in
Exhibit
7.3.
Three 
exceptions
apply
to
this
rule.
In
most
instances,
liability
arising
out
of
the
transportation
and
delivery
of 
property
(e.g.,
construction
materials,
mobile
equipment)
is
not
a
completed
operations
loss,
nor
is 
liability
arising
out
of
abandoned
or
unused
equipment
or
materials.
Certain
companies’
operations
are
of 
a
type
that
are,
by
the
rules
of
the
rating
guide
definition,
subject
to
the
general
aggregate
limit
rather
than 
the
products
and
completed
operations
limit. 
66Exhibit
7.3
 
Elements
of
a
Completed
Operations
Hazard
•
“Bodily
injury”
or
“property
damage”
that
occurs
anywhere
other
than
on
the
company’s
own 
premises
•
“Bodily
injury”
or
“property
damage”
that
arises
out
of
“your
product”
or
“your
work”
(which 
includes
work
performed
on
your
behalf
by
a
subcontractor)
•
“Your
work”
on
the
project
has
been
completed
or
abandoned.
With
respect
to
the
last
criterion
in
Exhibit
7.3,
work
is
considered
completed
when
any
one
of
the 
following
conditions
is
met. 
•
All
operations
called
for
in
the
contract
have
been
completed.
•
All
operations
at
the
site
of
the
operations
have
been
completed.
•
The
portion
of
the
project
out
of
which
the
loss
arose
has
been
put
to
its
intended
use.
If
a
single
contract
encompasses
several
projects
at
different
sites,
the
completion
of
all
work
at
any
one 
of
these
sites
will
cause
losses
at
that
particular
site
to
come
under
the
completed
operations
hazard.
If
all 
or
part
of
a
project
is
put
to
its
intended
use,
that
portion
of
the
project
will
be
considered
a
completed 
operation,
even
if
the
other
two
tests
have
not
been
satisfied.
For
example,
if
a
drilling
rig
has
two 
platforms
—one
in
the
course
of
construction
and
the
other
completed
and
already
in
use—the
platform
in 
use
would
be
considered
a
“completed
operation”
and
any
losses
arising
out
of
that
work
would
fall
under 
the
“products-completed
operations
hazard.”
An
exception
to
the
“intended
use”
test
applies
when
the
use 
of
the
work
is
by
another
contractor
or
subcontractor
working
on
the
same
project.
For
example,
building 
systems
such
as
heating,
lighting,
and
elevators
may
be
put
to
their
“intended
use”
by
contractors’ 
employees
still
at
work
in
the
building.
As
long
as
some
work
remains
to
be
done
by
the
heating, 
electrical,
or
elevator
contractor,
the
use
of
completed
portions
of
those
contractors’
work
by
other 
contractors
will
not
bring
the
products-completed
operations
hazard
into
play. 
Work
that
is
complete
except
for
any
correction,
repair,
replacement,
service,
or
maintenance
is 
considered
“complete.” 
Policy
Conditions
Section
IV
of
the
ISO
CGL
coverage
form
contains
the
CGL
conditions.
While
some
of
the
CGL 
conditions
represent
true
“conditions”
of
coverage
(actions
that,
if
not
performed,
void
the
contractual 
obligations
of
the
parties),
many
policy
conditions
merely
stipulate
various
terms
of
the
agreement.
It
is
a 
miscellaneous
group
of
contract
provisions
that
define
specific
rights
and
duties
of
both
the
insured
and 
the
insurer
or
give
more
detailed
explanations
of
how
the
policy’s
coverage
or
limits
will
apply. 
Some
of
the
policy
conditions
apply
exclusively
to
the
named
insured,
and
others
apply
to
all
insureds, 
including
those
that
automatically
qualify
for
insured
status
under
the
policy’s
“Who
Is
an
Insured” 
provision
and
those
that
have
additional
insured
status
by
means
of
an
endorsement.
For
example,
the 
policy
requires
the
named
insured
to
provide
timely
notice
of
any
claim
or
any
event
that
is
likely
to
give 
rise
to
a
claim,
including
claims
against
other
insureds.
However,
all
insureds
are
required
to
cooperate
in 
the
investigation
and
defense
of
any
claim
against
them. 
The
CGL
policy
contains
a
number
of
conditions.
This
course
examines
the
four
that
have
the
greatest 
implications
for
energy
industry
companies. 
Duties
in
the
Event
of
Occurrence,
Claim,
or
Suit
The
CGL
insurer
is
obligated
to
provide
a
defense
of
covered
claims,
as
well
as
to
pay
damages
awarded 
against
the
insured.
Providing
a
defense
requires
investigating
the
facts
of
the
claim.
With
the
passage
of 
time,
evidence
is
lost,
witnesses
become
unavailable
or
less
reliable
because
they
recall
less,
and 
claimants
may
become
less
willing
to
negotiate
a
settlement.
For
this
reason,
insurers
require
prompt
67notice
of
any
claim
or
suit
filed
against
the
insured,
as
well
as
any
occurrence
or
offense
that
could 
potentially
give
rise
to
a
claim. 
Further,
insureds
must
cooperate
in
the
investigation
and
defense
of
any
claim,
including
supplying 
copies
of
all
legal
papers
as
well
as
any
needed
documents
and
records
of
the
insured.
Failure
to
comply 
with
these
conditions
may
be
grounds
for
denial
of
the
claim. 
While
the
obligation
to
cooperate
in
the
investigation
and
defense
of
a
claim
applies
to
all
insureds,
the 
requirement
to
provide
notice
of
a
claim
applies
only
to
the
named
insured.
That
is,
the
named
insured
is 
solely
responsible
for
informing
the
insurer
that
a
claim,
or
an
event
that
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
claim,
has 
occurred,
regardless
of
which
insured
may
actually
be
named
in
the
suit.
It
is
not
necessary
to
have
all
of 
the
facts
to
report
an
occurrence,
but
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
comply
with
the
notice
requirements 
(i.e.,
provide
a
summary
of
the
events,
the
involved
parties,
witnesses,
etc.)
to
the
extent
possible. 
However,
it
is
better
to
provide
notice
with
incomplete
facts
than
to
delay
notice
altogether
to
the
point 
that
coverage
may
be
jeopardized. 
What
Is
“Prompt”
Notice?
The
notice
provision
requires
the
insured
to
give
notice
“as
soon
as
practicable”
of
a
claim,
suit, 
occurrence,
or
offense.
This
wording
leaves
room
for
interpretation
about
what
is
a
reasonable
amount
of 
time
for
giving
notice.
When
courts
have
been
asked
to
make
such
a
determination,
they
typically
give 
consideration
to
the
following
circumstances,
among
others:
(1)
the
length
of
the
delay
in
giving
notice, 
(2)
the
reasons
for
the
delay,
and
(3)
the
probable
effect
of
the
delay
on
the
insurer. 
There
are
no
hard
and
fast
rules
that
clarify
these
issues
precisely
for
all
circumstances,
and
those
that
can 
be
established
will
vary
by
state
as
caselaw
establishes
different
standards
in
different
jurisdictions.
For 
example,
some
courts
have
held
that
a
belief
that
there
were
no
damages
or
that
no
claims
would
be
filed 
(perhaps
on
the
assurance
of
the
injured
party)
is
a
valid
reason
for
not
reporting
an
occurrence,
while 
others
have
not
found
it
to
be
a
justifiable
reason
for
delay.
Courts
have
also
varied
as
to
whether
the 
insurer’s
ability
to
conduct
a
thorough
investigation
and
defense
of
the
claim
must
be
prejudiced
by
late 
reporting
to
void
coverage
for
breaching
this
condition. 
Insureds
are
sometimes
tempted
to
delay
the
reporting
of
an
incident
that
has
not
yet
produced
a
claim 
because
of
a
fear
that
it
will
negatively
affect
their
insurance
premiums.
This
is
a
risky
strategy
in
light
of 
the
fact
that
it
could
jeopardize
the
contractor’s
coverage
for
any
claim
that
eventually
materializes. 
The
Question
of
“Knowledge”
Some
energy
industry
companies,
such
as
operators
and
drilling
contractors,
face
a
daunting
challenge 
with
respect
to
their
reporting
obligations.
First
of
all,
the
named
insured
company
may
not
be
present
on 
the
drilling
site
at
all
times.
For
example,
an
operator
may
rely
on
well
service
contractors, 
subcontractors,
or
independent
consultants
to
perform
certain
tasks.
Similarly,
a
drilling
contractor
may 
contract
with
subcontractors
to
complete
performance
of
project–related
services.
If
the
operator
or 
drilling
contractor
is
not
informed
of
the
incident
(perhaps
because
it
was
not
considered
significant,
or 
perhaps
in
an
attempt
to
cover
up
a
mistake),
it
cannot
feasibly
provide
notice
to
the
insurer.
Even
if
the 
operator
or
drilling
contractor
has
a
full-time
presence
on
each
and
every
drilling
site,
there
may
be 
hundreds
of
subcontractors
performing
work
at
the
site,
and
the
site
itself
may
be
spread
over
a
large
area. 
It
is
virtually
impossible
for
the
operator
or
drilling
contractor
to
be
fully
aware
of
everything
that 
transpires
at
such
a
site. 
Operators
and
drilling
contractors
should
negotiate
a
clarification
of
these
issues
with
the
insurer
and
put 
it
in
writing.
Ideally,
the
agreed
upon
terms
will
be
attached
to
the
policy
as
an
endorsement.
(This
is
the 
only
way
to
ensure
the
agreed
upon
conditions
will
be
legally
enforceable.)
A
common
approach
is
to 
agree
that
the
named
insured
will
be
deemed
to
have
“knowledge”
of
a
claim,
occurrence,
or
offense 
when
a
person
with
at
least
a
certain
level
of
authority
becomes
aware
of
it,
such
as
an
executive
officer. 
See
the
discussion
of
“modified
notice
of
occurrence”
endorsements
later
in
this
course. 
Other
Insurance
Provision
68The
“other
insurance”
provision
spells
out
how
the
insurer’s
obligation
to
pay
claims
and
provide
a 
defense
are
impacted
when
the
insured
has
other
insurance
that
is
also
triggered
by
a
claim.
For
example, 
it
is
possible
to
have
some
overlap
in
coverage
between
an
operator
or
drilling
contractor’s
general 
liability
policy
and
its
professional
liability
policy.
More
often,
an
additional
insured
will
have
coverage 
under
both
the
policy
on
which
it
is
an
additional
insured
and
its
own
general
liability
policy. 
The
standard
CGL
policy
provides
that
coverage
applies
on
a
primary
basis
except
in
a
few
specified 
situations,
which
are
discussed
in
more
detail
below.
As
primary
coverage,
the
insurer’s
obligation
to 
provide
a
defense
is
triggered
immediately.
(The
duty
to
defend
may
not
be
immediate
when
a 
self-insured
retention
(SIR)
applies.
SIRs
are
discussed
in
more
detail
below.) 
CGL
as
Excess
The
standard
CGL
policy
provides
that
it
is
primary
over
other
valid
and
collectible
insurance,
except 
under
specified
circumstances,
which
are
summarized
in
Exhibit
7.4.
Those
circumstances
all
involve
the 
existence
of
other,
more
specific
insurance
covering
the
loss.
When
first-party
coverages
available
to
the 
insured
such
as
fire
and
builders
risk
insurance
also
cover
a
loss
that
would
be
covered
by
the
CGL,
the 
first-party
coverages
apply
as
primary.
Also,
if
a
loss
involves
aircraft,
autos,
or
watercraft
and
coverage 
is
available
under
both
the
CGL
and
the
specific
policies
designed
to
cover
such
vehicles,
the
CGL
is 
excess.
Coverage
is
also
excess
over
any
other
"primary"
policy—another
party's
CGL
policy,
for 
example—to
which
the
named
insured
has
been
added
as
an
insured.

With

or
separate

insurance
purchased
to
specifically
to
cover
your
liability
as
a

is
available.

With
respect
to
liability
arising
out
of
the
maintenance
or
use
of
aircraft,
“autos,”
or
watercraft, 
other
insurance
is
available
to
respond
to
the
claim.
•
The
other
insurance
available
to
you
also
states
it
is
primary
and
is
available
as
a
result
of 
your
status
under
that
policy
as
an
additional
insured
There
are
a
few
ways
that
the
above-referenced
conditions
might
come
into
play
for
energy
industry 
companies.
For
example,
assume
that
a
frack
fleet
is
damaged
by
explosion
due
to
the
negligence
of
the 
fracking
company’s
subcontractor
while
loading
diesel
fuel.
Assume
that
the
operator
contractually 
assumed
direct
liability
for
damage
to
the
frack
fleet
(regardless
of
fault).
Under
that
scenario,
the 
operator’s
CGL
policy
might
not
cover
physical
damage
or
loss
of
use
of
the
fleet.
A
claim
involving 
damage
to
the
fleet
might
trigger
coverage
under
both
the
operator’s
general
liability
policy
and
the 
operator’s
commercial
auto
policy.
When
a
situation
such
as
this
arises,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
CGL
policy 
to
provide
the
insured
with
excess
protection
over
that
of
the
more
specific
primary
policy. 
Another
condition
that
causes
the
policy
to
be
excess
is
that
the
other
insurance
available
to
you
is
under
a 
primary
policy
on
which
you
have
additional
insured
status.
When
operators
and
drilling
contractors
are 
required
to
provide
additional
insured
status
(or
when
they
require
such
status
from
each
other
or
their 
subcontractors),
that
requirement
typically
states
that
the
coverage
provided
to
the
additional
insured
will 
be
“primary
and
noncontributory.”
This
means
that
the
policy
will
respond
to
a
claim
against
the 
additional
insured
on
a
primary
basis
without
requiring
the
additional
insured’s
own
general
liability 
policy
to
contribute
to
the
payment
of
any
claims,
which
is
consistent
with
the
parties’
intent.
The
CGL 
policy’s
other
insurance
language
causes
the
policy
on
which
the
party
is
an
additional
insured
to
be 
primary
and
the
policy
on
which
the
party
is
a
named
insured
(“you”)
to
be
excess.
When
both
policies 
have
standard
language,
this
provides
a
clear
order
of
payment.
Nonstandard
policies
may
not
include
the 
clarifying
language
with
respect
to
coverage
available
to
you
as
an
additional
insured.
Energy
industry 
companies
should
check
the
wording
of
their
CGL
policy
other
insurance
provision,
and
if
it
is
not
there, 
they
should
request
this
type
of
modification.
Because
it
reduces
the
insurer’s
exposure,
there
should
be 
no
resistance
to
the
change. 
Ensuring
your
own
policy
will
not
interfere
with
the
intended
order
of
payment
as
outlined
above
is 
important
but
not
sufficient.
To
ensure
the
additional
insured
coverage
works
as
intended,
the
contract 
should
require
that
the
additional
insured
coverage
will
be
“primary
and
noncontributory.”
ISO 
introduced
a
primary
and
noncontributory
endorsement
(CG
20
01)
in
2013
that
enables
CGL
insureds
to 
evidence
compliance
with
this
contract
requirement.
This
endorsement
states—reiterates,
really—that
the 
coverage
provided
to
the
additional
insured
is
on
a
primary
basis.
However,
it
further
states
that
the 
insurer
will
not
seek
contribution
from
any
other
insurance
under
which
the
additional
insured
is
a
named 
insured—in
other
words,
it
will
not
seek
to
force
the
additional
insured’s
own
CGL
insurer
to
contribute 
to
the
settlement
or
payment
of
a
covered
claim.
This
limitation
would
not
prevent
the
insurer
from 
seeking
contribution
from
another
policy
under
which
its
additional
insured
may
also
have
additional 
insured
status.
Since
one
of
the
major
insurance
protections
that
is
commonly
required
by
indemnified 
parties
in
oil
and
gas
contracts
is
being
named
as
an
additional
insured,
it
is
very
important
to
remember 
to
match
the
“primary
and
noncontributory”
insurance
protection
to
the
indemnity
obligation,
meaning 
that
Endorsement
CG
20
01
should
be
extended
to
all
of
the
indemnified
parties,
such
as
the
Operator 
Group
or
the
Contractor
Group.
In
sum,
endorsement
CG
20
01
is
a
crucial
component
of
risk
allocation 
in
oil
and
gas
contracts
and
energy
industry
companies
should
make
sure
to
include
this
endorsement 
when
necessary. 
Conflicting
Provisions
70Sometimes,
the
other
insurance
provisions
of
the
policies
that
are
triggered
conflict
with
each
other.
For 
example,
both
policies
may
state
that
they
are
primary,
or
both
policies
may
state
that
they
are
excess, 
with
respect
to
a
given
claim.
When
both
policies
provide
primary
coverage,
the
policy
provides
a 
formula
for
sharing
the
loss.
In
some
cases,
the
insurers
will
contribute
equal
amounts.
If
one
of
the 
policy’s
limits
is
reached,
the
remaining
insurer(s)
will
continue
to
pay
until
its
limit
has
also
been 
exhausted
or
the
claim
is
resolved.
In
other
cases,
the
insurers
will
contribute
based
on
their
applicable 
policy
limits.
The
insurer
with
the
higher
applicable
limit
will
pay
a
proportionately
higher
share
of
the 
loss.
Under
this
approach,
unless
one
or
both
of
the
insurers’
applicable
policy
limits
have
been
eroded
by 
other
claims,
the
insurers’
policy
limits
will
be
reached
at
the
same
time. 
The
more
troubling
situation
is
when
both
policies
state
they
are
excess
with
respect
to
a
given
claim. 
This
situation
is
not
as
common
in
CGL
policies
as
with
some
other
types
of
policies,
primarily
because 
the
standard
CGL
policy
states
that
it
is
primary
in
most
cases.
Conflicting
“other
insurance”
provisions 
between
two
CGL
policies
generally
arise
when
at
least
one
of
the
policies
is
written
on
a
nonstandard 
policy
form
(a
form
developed
specifically
for
use
by
an
individual
insurer).
If,
for
example,
you
are
an 
additional
insured
on
a
nonstandard
policy
that
states
it
is
excess
over
any
other
available
insurance,
there 
will
be
a
conflict
between
your
coverage
as
an
additional
insured
and
your
own
standard
CGL
coverage, 
which
also
states
that
it
is
excess
with
respect
to
any
policy
on
which
you
have
coverage
as
an
additional 
insured.
This
type
of
situation
often
results
in
a
standoff
between
insurers
with
respect
to
which
policy 
must
pay
first. 
An
approach
used
by
some
insurers
on
nonstandard
policy
forms
is
to
stipulate
that
the
coverage
provided 
to
an
additional
insured
is
excess
coverage
unless
primary
(or
primary
and
noncontributory)
coverage
is 
required
in
the
underlying
contract—in
this
case,
the
construction
contract.
While
it
is
unlikely
that
a 
contract
will
require
additional
insured
status
that
is
excess,
it
is
possible
for
the
contract
to
be
silent
on 
this
matter,
which
may
result
in
a
coverage
dispute.
Operators
and
drilling
contractors
should
include 
clear
language
in
their
contracts
and
subcontracts
that
the
coverage
provided
to
them
as
additional 
insureds
is
to
be
primary
and
noncontributory. 
The
standard
CGL
policy
provides
that
when
it
is
excess,
the
insurer
has
no
duty
to
defend
any
claim
that 
another
insurer
has
a
duty
to
defend.
However,
it
further
provides
that
if
no
other
insurer
provides
a 
defense,
the
insurer
will
do
so.
This
at
least
guarantees
access
to
a
defense.
(The
insurers
are
left
to
sort 
out
how
the
defense
costs
will
be
allocated.) 
Impact
of
an
Indemnity
Agreement
With
respect
to
oil
and
gas
contracts,
some
courts
have
resolved
“other
insurance”
conflicts
between
the 
named
insured’s
and
additional
insured’s
CGL
policies
in
light
of
the
indemnity
agreement
between
the 
parties.
In
such
cases,
the
courts
interpret
a
request
for
additional
insured
status
on
the
presumption
that 
such
requests
are
for
coverage
that
will
pay
first,
before
the
additional
insured’s
own
policy.
The 
reasoning
behind
this
presumption
is
that
the
additional
insured
could
alternatively
enforce
its
indemnity 
agreement
with
the
named
insured,
in
which
case
the
additional
insured’s
own
policy
would
not
be
called 
upon
to
contribute. 
Separation
of
Insureds
Provision
In
most
instances,
the
CGL
policy
applies
to
each
covered
entity
as
if
the
other
insureds
did
not
exist.
For 
example,
suppose
an
employee
of
the
named
insured
files
a
claim
against
an
additional
insured
for
an 
injury
sustained
as
a
result
of
the
additional
insured’s
negligence.
The
employers
liability
exclusion 
would
not
apply
in
that
case
because
the
claimant
is
not
an
employee
of
the
additional
insured.
The
fact 
that
the
claimant
is
an
employee
of
the
named
insured
is
irrelevant
with
regard
to
the
claim
against
the 
additional
insured. 
The
separation
of
insureds
provision
also
protects
insureds
from
the
acts
of
other
insureds.
For
example, 
if
one
insured
(an
employee)
intentionally
causes
a
loss
that
results
in
a
claim
against
another
insured
(the 
named
insured
contractor),
the
intentional
loss
exclusion
will
not
prevent
the
claim
against
the
innocent 
party
(the
contractor).
Likewise,
if
one
insured
refuses
to
cooperate
in
the
investigation
of
a
claim,
other 
insureds
named
in
that
suit
will
not
be
denied
coverage
based
on
the
actions
of
the
uncooperative
insured.
71Subrogation
Provision
Insurance
companies
routinely
pay
claims
on
behalf
of
their
insureds
that
someone
other
than
the
insured 
is
legally
responsible
to
pay.
For
example,
if
an
electrician’s
shoddy
work
causes
a
fire
in
a
building,
the 
owner’s
property
insurer
will
pay
the
cost
of
repairing
the
fire
damage.
When
such
a
payment
is
made, 
however,
the
insurer
receives
the
insured’s
legal
right
to
pursue
recovery
from
the
responsible
party.
This 
action
is
commonly
known
as
subrogation. 
The
CGL
policy’s
“Transfer
of
Recovery
Rights
Against
Others
to
Us”
provision
(commonly
referred
to 
as
the
“subrogation”
provision)
stipulates
that
when
the
insurer
makes
payment
under
the
policy,
it
is 
entitled
to
the
insured’s
rights
of
recovery
against
any
party
that
is
responsible
for
the
damages
paid
by 
the
insurer.
Without
some
type
of
exception,
this
provision
would
cause
a
problem
when
the
responsible 
party
is
someone
the
insured
has
promised
to
hold
harmless
from
any
loss.
For
example,
an
operator 
agrees
to
indemnify
a
drilling
contractor
and
hold
it
harmless
for
damages
arising
out
of
its
work
and
the 
work
of
its
Operator
Group
at
the
drilling
site.
A
visitor
to
the
drilling
rig
is
injured
while
the
operator’s 
equipment
service
contractor
was
performing
operations
and
files
a
suit
against
both
the
operator
and
the 
drilling
contractor.
The
operator’s
insurer
pays
the
claim
but
then
attempts
to
recover
a
portion
of
the 
amount
paid
from
the
drilling
contractor
on
the
grounds
that
the
drilling
contractor
was
partially 
responsible
for
the
loss.
This
violates
the
intended
transfer
of
risk
between
the
operator
and
the
drilling 
contractor. 
Fortunately,
the
policy
contains
a
provision
for
this
type
of
contractual
agreement.
Specifically,
it
requires 
the
insured
to
protect
the
insurer’s
right
to
recover
from
responsible
parties
and
to
“do
nothing
after
loss” 
to
impair
those
rights.
By
inference,
the
insured
does
have
the
right
to
waive
its
rights
of
recovery
and 
thus
the
insurer’s
ability
to
subrogate
based
on
those
rights,
before
a
loss
occurs.
Courts
have
largely 
upheld
this
interpretation
of
the
provision. 
There
is
no
requirement
that
the
wavier
be
in
writing,
although
that
is
useful
in
establishing
that
a
waiver 
did
in
fact
exist
before
the
loss
occurred.
(The
burden
of
proof
in
this
instance
is
on
the
insured.)
Nor
is 
the
insured
required
to
notify
the
insurer
that
it
has
waived
subrogation
rights
against
another
party. 
However,
operators
and
drilling
contractors
are
sometimes
required
to
provide
proof
that
the
insurer’s 
subrogation
rights
against
the
other
contracting
party
have
been
waived.
A
standard
endorsement
is 
available
for
this
purpose.
Some
insurers
may
want
to
charge
an
extra
premium
for
attaching
this 
endorsement
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
giving
up
a
right
they
would
otherwise
have.
If
the
policy 
includes
the
“do
nothing
after
a
loss”
language
described
above,
and
the
operator
and
drilling
contractor 
has
already
waived
its
rights
of
recovery
against
that
party
in
the
oil
or
gas
contract,
the
insurer’s 
argument
is
incorrect,
and
no
extra
premium
is
warranted.

CGL
Endorsements
The
standard
CGL
policy
is
designed
to
provide
some
core
coverages
that
are
commonly
needed
by
a 
cross
section
of
industries.
Tailoring
the
policy
to
meet
industry-specific
needs
of
energy
industry 
companies
commonly
requires
a
variety
of
modifications
to
the
policy.
Chapter

examines
many
of
the 
endorsements
commonly
used
to
modify
the
CGL
policies
of
companies
in
the
energy
industry. 
73Learning
Objectives
In
this
chapter,
you
will
learn
how
to…
1.
recognize
the
circumstances
under
which
it
may
become
necessary
or 
desirable
to
attach
an
endorsement
to
a
CGL
policy
and
recognize
the 
ways
in
which
endorsements
can
alter
a
policy’s
coverage
2.
assess
the
characteristics
of
the
oil
and
gas
industry
that
create
a
need
or 
desire
for
endorsements
that
modify
the
CGL
policy,
and
recognize
the 
desirable
and
undesirable
effects
of
these
endorsements.
Some
endorsements
are
inexpensive
and
easy
to
obtain,
while
others
are
available
only
at
significant
cost, 
if
at
all.
Some
expand
the
company’s
scope
of
coverage,
and
some
narrow
the
scope
of
coverage.
Others 
change
how
the
policy
operates,
such
as
how
the
limits
apply,
who
is
insured
under
the
policy,
or
other 
policy
conditions. 
Standard
endorsements
are
available
for
accomplishing
a
variety
of
policy
modifications,
but
in
many 
cases,
nonstandard
endorsements
are
required.
Individual
insurers
typically
have
their
own
endorsements 
they
routinely
use
for
certain
purposes.
(Insurers
use
their
own
endorsements
either
because
there
is
no 
standard
endorsement
or
because
they
want
to
modify
the
language
of
the
standard
endorsement.) 
Sometimes,
the
insurer
and
insured
will
draft
an
endorsement—from
scratch
or
by
modifying
an
existing 
endorsement—to
accomplish
a
specific
objective
on
a
given
policy.
These
negotiated
endorsements
are 
known
as
“manuscript”
endorsements. 
Endorsements
That
Expand
Coverage
Some
endorsements
expand
the
scope
of
coverage
by
deleting
exclusions,
modifying
how
various 
coverage
provisions
will
apply,
changing
policy
definitions,
etc.
The
following
endorsements
are 
commonly
needed
by
operators,
drilling
contractors,
other
contractors,
and
consultants
to
avoid
gaps 
between
their
CGL
coverage
and
their
risk
exposures. 
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment
Coverage
The
underground
resources
and
equipment
coverage
endorsement
(CG
22
62)
is
an
endorsement
that
is 
frequently
attached
to
CGL
policies
issued
to
companies
in
the
energy
industry.
The
endorsement
is 
intended
to
apply
to
a
large
range
of
oil
and
gas
operations,
unless
coverage
for
such
exposures
is 
provided
through
the
use
of
the
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment
exclusion
endorsement
(CG
22 
57).
CG
22
62
makes
three
components
of
the
CGL
"damage
to
property"
exclusion
inapplicable
to 
property
damage
claims
that
fall
within
the
endorsement's
scope,
thereby
broadening
the
CGL
policy’s 
definition
of
“property
damage”
to
include
loss
of
underground
resources.
To
that
end,
the
endorsement 
states
that
the
“damage
to
property”
exclusion
does
not
apply
to: 
•
Damage
to
real
property
in
the
insured’s
care,
custody,
or
control.
•
Damage
to
real
property
on
which
the
insured
or
any
contractors
or
subcontractors
working 
directly
or
indirectly
on
the
insured’s
behalf
are
performing
operations
if
the
“property
damage” 
arises
out
of
those
operations.
•
Damage
to
property
that
must
be
restored,
repaired
or
replaced
because
the
insured’s
work
was 
incorrectly
performed
on
it.
The
endorsement
defines
“underground
resources
and
equipment
hazard”
as
“property
damage”
to
the 
following: 
•
Oil,
gas,
water
or
other
mineral
substances
which
have
not
been
reduced
to
physical
possession 
above

Operators
should
make
sure
that
the
underground
resources
and
equipment
coverage
endorsement
is 
attached
to
their
policies.
However,
the
extension
of
coverage
under
the
endorsement
is
not
absolute.
In 
fact,
the
endorsement
modifies
Coverage
A
to
add
two
additional
exclusions
which
pertain
to
claims
or 
suits
by
co-owners
of
a
mineral
lease.
First,
the
CGL
policy
does
not
apply
to
any
costs
or
expenses 
incurred
by
the
insured
or
at
the
insured’s
request
or
at
the
request
of
any
“co-owner
of
the
working 
interest”
in
connection
with
bringing
a
well
under
control.
The
endorsement
defines
“co-owner
of
the 
working
interest”
as
any
person
or
organization
that
is
the
insured’s
co-owner,
joint
venturer,
or
mining 
partner
in
mineral
properties
who
participates
in
the
operating
expense
of
such
properties
or
has
the
right 
to
participate
in
the
control,
development,
or
operation
of
such
properties.
In
other
words,
the
insured’s 
costs
associated
with
bringing
a
well
under
control
are
excluded
from
coverage.
Furthermore,
the
CGL 
policy
does
not
apply
to
damages
claimed
by
any
“co-owner
of
the
working
interest.”
These
exclusions 
dovetail
with
an
additional
condition
imposed
by
the
endorsement
on
the
insured
which
requires
the 
insured,
at
the
insured’s
own
cost
and
expense,
“promptly
and
diligently”
take
whatever
steps
are 
necessary
or
legally
required
to
bring
a
well
under
control.
Operators
and
drilling
contractors
need
to
be 
aware
of
the
interplay
of
this
endorsement
with
the
rest
of
the
CGL
policy.
This
is
especially
true
with 
respect
to
underground
pollution
losses.
If
the
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment
Coverage 
endorsement
does
not
amend
the
pollution
coverage
afforded
under
the
CGL
policy,
and
there
is
a 
pollution
element
to
an
underground
loss,
a
situation
could
arise
where
the
pollution
portion
of
the
policy 
or
the
underground
resources
and
equipment
coverage
portion
of
the
policy
could
both
come
into
to
play. 
Operators
and
drilling
contractors
should
not
assume
that
the
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment 
Coverage
endorsement
will
result
in
coverage
for
underground
pollution
losses. 
Since
the
underground
resources
and
equipment
coverage
endorsement
modifies
the
CGL
policy
to 
exclude
coverage
for
control
of
well
activities,
operators
should
consider
purchasing
an
OEE/COW 
insurance
policy. 
Time
Element
Pollution
Exclusion
The
time
element
pollution
exclusion
endorsement
has
become
prevalent
in
CGL
policies
issued
to
the 
energy
industry.
This
endorsement
adds
back
a
very
narrow
coverage
grant
for
liability
arising
from
the 
release
of
pollutants,
provided
that
the
pollution
event
begins
during
the
policy
period,
is
discovered 
within
the
time
specified
in
the
endorsement,
and
is
reported
to
the
insurer
within
the
time
specified
in
the 
endorsement.
In
other
words,
coverage
for
the
release
of
pollutants
may
exist
if
the
pollution
event
is 
discovered
and
reported
to
the
insurer
within
a
specific
period
of
time.
The
wording
for
this
coverage 
grant
differs
from
insurer
to
insurer.
However,
most
time
element
pollution
exclusion
endorsements
are 
written
on
an
occurrence
basis
and
typically
require
the
release
of
pollutants
to
be
detected
by
the
insured 
within
a
set
time
period
(generally
30
days)
of
the
commencement
of
the
release,
and
reported
to
the 
insurer
within
a
set
time
period
(generally
60
or
90
days)
of
the
commencement
of
the
release.
The
time 
frame
during
which
the
release
of
pollution
must
be
detected
and
reported
varies
from
insurer
to
insurer,
a 
fact
that
should
be
noted
by
energy
industry
companies.
Some
endorsements
require
the
insured
to 
discover
the
pollution
event
within
7
days
of
its
commencement
and
report
it
to
the
insurer
within
21
days 
of
its
commencement.
If
the
time
period
of
discovering
and
reporting
the
release
of
pollution
is
too 
limited
in
duration,
meaningful
coverage
for
pollution
liability
exposures
will
not
exist
under
the
time 
element
pollution
exclusion
endorsement. 
Additionally,
certain
time
element
pollution
exclusion
endorsements
require
the
release
of
pollutants
to
be 
“sudden
and
accidental,”
whereas
others
merely
require
that
the
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising 
from
the
release
of
pollutants
commences
during
the
policy
period. 
It
is
important
to
remember
that
endorsement’s
timeframe
starts
when
the
pollution
event
commences,
not 
when
the
insured
discovers
the
pollution
event.
Although
the
time
element
pollution
exclusion
provides 
some
coverage
for
pollution
liability
exposures,
the
risk
of
undiscovered
release,
seepage,
or 
contamination
of
pollutants
at
onshore
and
offshore
drilling
sites
is
significant.
Therefore,
energy
industry
75companies
should
consider
purchasing
pollution
legal
liability,
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance, 
or
other
specialty
environmental
insurance. 
Designated
Pollutants
Coverage
As
discussed
previously,
the
Coverage
A
“pollution”
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
a
release
of
pollutants
at 
a
non-owned
site
if
the
insured
did
not
bring
the
pollutants
to
the
site.
(Other
conditions
also
apply,
but 
they
are
not
relevant
to
this
discussion.)
For
energy
industry
companies
whose
primary
business
involves 
the
use
of
chemicals
and
other
substances
that
could
be
harmful
to
persons
or
property,
such
as
ethylene 
glycol
in
drilling
mud
or
boric
acid
in
fracking
fluids,
this
exception
does
little
in
the
way
of
restoring 
coverage
for
the
company’s
off-site
operations. 
The
pollution
exclusion—limited
exception
for
designated
pollutant(s)
endorsement
CG
04
30
provides 
that
with
respect
to
a
pollutant
specifically
listed
in
the
endorsement’s
schedule,
the
insured
will
have 
coverage
for
an
accidental
release
of
such
substances
on
the
insured’s
own
premises
as
well
as
at
sites 
where
the
insured
is
conducting
operations.
However,
the
endorsement
contains
one
exclusion
of
its
own. 
Its
exception
to
the
pollution
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
any
scheduled
pollutant
while
that
pollutant
is 
being
transported
or
stored
for
others,
or
while
it
is
being
transported,
handled,
stored,
treated,
disposed 
of,
or
processed
as
waste.
Therefore,
oilfield
service
contractors
who
haul
waste
to
and
from
job
sites 
could
not
use
endorsement
CG
04
30
to
arrange
basic
liability
for
the
“pollutants”
specifically
involved
in 
business
operations.
However,
other
companies
whose
operations
require
them
to
bring
chemicals
and 
other
hazardous
substances
onto
a
site,
or
that
store
drums
of
fuel
and
lubricants
on
their
premises
for
use 
with
equipment
and
machinery,
can
obtain
coverage
for
an
accidental
release
of
such
substances
by 
attaching
this
endorsement. 
Limited
Exception
for
Short-Term
Pollution
Event
Two
endorsements
provide
broadened
coverage
of
pollution
losses
by
adding
exceptions
to
the
CGL 
pollution
exclusion. 
The
pollution
exclusion-named
peril
limited
exception
for
a
short-term
pollution
event
endorsement
(CG 
04
28)
provides
broadened
coverage
of
pollution
losses
by
adding
exceptions
to
the
Coverage
A
pollution 
exclusion
for
“short-term
pollution
events”
that
are
caused
by
a
“named
peril.”
The
endorsement
deletes 
the
pollution
exclusion
in
its
entirety
and
replaces
it
with
a
new
version
of
the
exclusion
that
contains
the 
“named
peril”
and
“short
term
pollution
event”
provisions.
These
provisions
affect
the
sections
of
the 
pollution
exclusion
pertaining
to
on-premises
pollution
events
and
to
pollutants
brought
to
an 
off-premises
job
site
by
the
insured.
When
CG
04
28
is
used,
those
sections
of
the
pollution
exclusion
do 
not
apply
if:
(1)
the
escape
or
release
of
pollutants
is
a
“short-term
pollution
event”
and
(2)
the
escape
or 
release
is
attributable
to
one
of
the
enumerated
“named
perils.” 
The
term
“short
term
pollution
event”
is
defined
in
the
endorsement
as
an
escape,
release,
discharge,
or 
dispersal
of
pollutants
that
begins
during
the
policy
period;
ends
completely
at
an
identified
time
no
later 
than
48
hours
after
it
begins;
must
be
reported
to
the
insurer
as
soon
as
practicable,
but
in
no
case
more 
than
14
days
after
it
ends;
and
must
not
originate
from
an
underground
storage
tank.
An
intermittent
(i.e., 
noncontinuous)
escape
of
the
same
pollutants
from
the
same
source
will
be
considered
a
single
pollution 
event
and
must
meet
the
48-hour
requirement
in
its
entirety
to
qualify
for
the
exception. 
The
term
“named
perils”
is
also
defined
by
the
endorsement
to
mean
lightning,
windstorm,
or
earthquake; 
explosion,
implosion,
collapse,
puncture,
bursting,
rupture,
collision,
or
overturn
of
a
tank,
vessel,
piece 
of
machinery
or
equipment,
or
similar
apparatus
or
device,
including
attached
pipes,
pumps,
or
valves;
or 
vandalism
or
malicious
mischief
by
someone
other
than
an
insured.
The
explosion,
rupture,
or
collision 
peril
does
not
apply
with
respect
to
"autos";
that
peril
is
covered
by
standard
auto
liability
insurance.
Nor 
does
it
apply
if
the
explosion,
collapse,
rupture,
etc.,
is
caused
by
deterioration
or
wear
and
tear. 
The
causation
requirement
under
this
endorsement
is
not
restrictive.
To
be
covered,
the
pollution
event 
must
be
one
that
would
not
have
occurred
“but
for”
the
named
peril.
Therefore,
the
named
peril
does
not 
need
to
be
the
sole
or
proximate
cause
of
the
pollution
event;
it
only
needs
to
be
a
necessary
link
in
the 
chain
of
events
causing
the
escape
or
release.
Consider
the
following
scenario.
A
system
of
storage
tanks
76for
the
insured’s
product,
a
hazardous
chemical
used
in
fracking
operations,
is
regulated
by
an
electronic 
monitoring
device
that
prevents
the
accidental
overflow
of
the
chemical
from
the
open
tanks.
Lightning 
strikes
the
insured's
facility,
disabling
the
electronic
monitor
and
allowing
the
chemical
in
one
of
the 
tanks
to
spill
out
for
a
period
of
several
hours
(but
fewer
than
48)
before
the
insured
becomes
aware
of
the 
spill
and
ends
it.
Lightning
did
not
directly
cause
this
pollution
event,
but
the
lightning
was
a
necessary 
causative
link.
The
overflow
would
not
have
occurred
but
for
the
lightning.
Therefore,
it
meets
the 
endorsement's
definition
of
a
short-term
pollution
event
from
a
named
peril. 
The
modified
exclusion
incorporates
exceptions
also
found
in
the
basic
CGL
pollution
exclusion:
fumes 
from
building
heating
equipment
and
water
heaters;
releases
at
or
from
an
additional
insured
project 
owner's
premises;
hostile
fire;
fumes
from
materials
used
in
connection
with
the
insured's
off-premises 
operations;
and
accidental
release
of
operating
fluids
from
mobile
equipment. 
A
second
endorsement,
the
pollution
exclusion—limited
exception
for
a
short
term
pollution
event,
(CG 
04
29)
provides
the
same
limited
exception
for
short
term
pollution
events
but
without
the
requirement 
that
the
pollution
event
be
caused
by
a
named
peril.
In
other
words,
“short
term
pollution
events”
may
be 
covered
regardless
of
the
circumstances
that
give
rise
to
those
events.
However,
this
endorsement
adds 
two
stipulations
to
the
definition
of
“short-term
pollution
event.”
First,
the
defined
term
does
not
include 
a
“repeat
or
resumption”
within
12
months
of
a
previous
pollution
event
involving
the
same
pollutants 
and
the
same
source.
Second,
the
defined
term
does
not
include
heat,
smoke,
or
fumes
from
a
hostile
fire. 
Coverage
in
connection
with
pollutants
of
this
kind
comes
by
way
of
the
separate
provision
regarding 
hostile
fire,
which
is
contained
in
the
basic
CGL
pollution
exclusion. 
Although
both
short-term
pollution
event
endorsements
provide
some
coverage
for
pollution
liability 
exposures,
most
pollution
events
associated
with
oil
and
gas
operations
would
not
end
within
48
hours 
after
they
begin.
Moreover,
the
14
day
reporting
requirement
is
stringent.
Consequently,
the
coverage 
afforded
under
these
endorsements
is
minimal,
at
best.
Energy
industry
companies
would
be
advised 
purchasing
pollution
legal
liability
insurance,
contractor’s
pollution
liability
insurance,
or
other
specialty 
environmental
insurance. 
Endorsements
That
Constrict
Coverage
Some
endorsements
constrict
the
scope
of
coverage
by
adding
new
exclusions,
modifying
how
various 
coverage
provisions
will
apply,
changing
policy
definitions,
etc.
Certain
exclusionary
endorsements
are 
routinely
attached
to
contractors’
policies
(or
certain
types
of
contractors’
policies)
to
restrict
coverage
for 
certain
types
of
claims.
Some
exclusionary
endorsements
are
less
commonly
used,
but
the
very
fact
that 
they
exist
is
something
contractors
should
be
alerted
to
watch
for
their
use.
The
following
discussion 
covers
some
endorsements
in
each
of
these
categories. 
Generally,
insurers
use
a
variety
of
endorsements
to
remove
coverage
for
risks
they
are
not
willing
to 
insure.
Sometimes
insurers’
unwillingness
to
cover
certain
risks
is
based
on
a
general
underwriting 
philosophy,
and
other
times
it
is
based
on
specific
characteristics
of
the
insured
contractor. 
Designated
Professional
Services
Exclusion
The
standard
CGL
policy
does
not
include
a
professional
liability
exclusion,
but
one
is
almost
always 
added
to
energy
industry
companies’
policies
by
endorsement.
Because
the
standards
of
care
and
damages 
sought
are
often
very
different
for
professional
liability
losses,
most
insurers
will
carve
these
claims
out 
of
the
CGL
policy
and
require
energy
firms
needing
this
coverage
to
purchase
separate
professional 
liability
insurance.
A
standard
endorsement
is
available
for
excluding
professional
liability
on
energy 
companies’
policies.
This
endorsement
is
a
virtually
total
exclusion
for
bodily
injury
and
property
damage 
arising
out
of
an
energy
industry
company’s
design
services.
The
Designated
Professional
Services 
exclusion
endorsement
(CG
21
16)
is
used
by
insurance
companies
when
underwriters
detect
exposures 
under
the
CGL
policy
that
should
be
excluded
and
for
which
no
special
professional
liability
exclusion
is 
available.
The
endorsement
contains
a
schedule
for
listing
a
description
of
the
professional
services
to 
which
the
exclusion
applies.
For
example,
if
an
operator
hires
an
oil
and
gas
consultant
to
create
a
drilling 
plan
for
an
oil
well
and
to
consult
and
assist
in
the
drilling
of
the
well,
an
endorsement
to
the
consultant’s 
CGL
might
specify
that
the
exclusion
applies
to
“Oil
and
Gas
Consultant
Operations.”
Suppose
that
the
77contract
between
the
operator
and
the
oil
and
gas
consultant
states
that
the
consultant
is
responsible
for 
ensuring
that
the
drill
pipe
does
not
fail
under
the
drilling
conditions,
and
also
requires
the
consultant
to 
indemnify
the
operator
for
any
claims,
losses,
damages,
or
expenses
arising
from
providing
or
failing
to 
provide
professional
services.
A
blowout
of
the
well
subsequently
occurs
after
the
consultant
fails
to 
instruct
the
mud
logger
to
check
for
metal
shavings
in
the
drilling
fluid.
The
operator
sues
the
consultant 
seeking
damages
associated
with
the
blowout.
Under
that
scenario,
the
designated
professional
services 
exclusion
would
bar
coverage
for
the
consultant
under
the
consultant’s
CGL
policy. 
The
Designated
Professional
Services
exclusion
is
significant
given
that
energy
industry
contracts, 
including
contracts
for
professional
services,
typically
contain
indemnity
provisions
in
which
risk
is 
allocated
to
one
party
to
the
contract.
To
the
extent
that
the
consultant
does
not
have
separate
professional 
liability
insurance,
the
designated
professional
services
exclusion
would
result
in
an
unanticipated 
exposure
under
the
CGL
policy.
The
risk
allocation
system
in
most
drilling
contracts
further
complicates 
matters.
Remember
that
most
drilling
contracts
have
broad,
reciprocal
indemnity
clauses
and
include
a 
pass-through
provision
where
a
party
such
as
the
operator
is
required
to
indemnify
the
drilling
contractor 
for
the
consultant’s
negligence
if
the
operator’s
group
includes
a
consultant
providing
professional 
services.
Consequently,
operators
should
resist
the
attachment
of
professional
services
exclusions
to
their 
CGL
policies
as
it
represents
a
significant
reduction
in
coverage. 
Finally,
it
is
important
to
note
that
coverage
for
professional
services
would
not
exist
under
the
exception 
to
the
contractual
liability
exclusion.
That
exclusion
carves
out
coverage
for
“liability
that
the
insured 
would
have
in
the
absence
of
the
contract
or
agreement”
and
“liability
assumed
in
an
‘insured
contract.’” 
The
first
exception
to
the
contractual
liability
exclusion
would
not
apply
if
the
consultant
incurs
liability 
because
it
breached
its
contract
with
the
operator.
Damages
for
breach
of
contract
would
not
be
covered 
by
the
CGL
policy.
The
second
exception
to
the
contractual
liability
is
just
as
problematic
since
the 
definition
of
“insured
contract”
specifically
requires
assumption
of
another’s
“tort”
liability.
To
the
extent 
a
consultant
agrees
to
assume
the
tort
liability
of
the
operator,
the
CGL
policy
will
respond
to
that 
liability,
provided
no
other
exclusions
or
conditions
apply.
However,
assumption
of
another
party’s 
contractual
liabilities
will
not
be
covered.
Additionally,
coverage
under
the
exceptions
to
the
contractual 
liability
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
direct
claims
made
by
the
indemnitee
(e.g.,
the
operator)
against
the 
indemnitor
(e.g.,
the
insured
contractor),
such
as
the
example
discussed
above
where
the
consultant
was 
contractually
obligated
to
ensure
the
drill
pipe
did
not
fail.
In
sum,
coverage
for
professional
services 
liability
may
not
be
covered
under
the
CGL
policy. 
Because
of
the
gaps
in
the
CGL
policy’s
professional
liability
coverage,
energy
industry
companies
with 
any
professional
liability
exposure
should
consider
the
purchase
of
oil
and
gas
professional
liability 
insurance.
Several
niche
markets
exist
for
this
coverage. 
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment
Exclusion
Many
CGL
policies
issued
to
operators,
drilling
contractors,
well
service
consultants,
and
other
energy 
industry
contractors
or
consultants
contain
an
underground
resources
and
equipment
exclusion 
endorsement
(CG
22
57)
that
excludes
liability
for
property
damage
included
within
the
underground 
resources
and
equipment
hazard.
The
definition
of
“underground
resources
and
equipment
hazard”
is 
identical
to
that
contained
in
the
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment
Coverage
endorsement
(CG
22 
62)
discussed
above. 
The
endorsement
is
intended
to
apply
to
a
large
range
of
oil
and
gas
operations,
unless
coverage
for
such 
exposures
is
provided
through
the
use
of
the
Underground
Resources
and
Equipment
Coverage 
endorsement
(CG
22
62).
For
example,
an
oil
well
servicer
may
be
hired
by
an
operator
to
service
a
well 
and
the
contract
may
require
the
oil
well
servicer
to
indemnify
the
operator.
While
servicing
the
well,
a 
cable
breaks
and
the
sinker
bar
gets
caught
in
the
hole.
The
operator
brings
a
claim
against
the
oil
well 
servicer
for
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
the
hole.
The
oil
well
servicer
seeks
coverage
for
this
claim
under
its 
CGL
policy.
The
cable
and
sinker
bar
would
likely
qualify
as
“any
casing,
pipe,
bit,
tool,
pump,
or
other 
drilling
or
well
servicing
machinery
or
equipment
located
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
any
such 
well
or
hole”
portion
of
the
definition
of
“underground
resources
and
equipment
hazard.”
Consequently, 
coverage
for
the
oil
well
servicer’s
claim
would
be
barred
if
the
oil
well
servicer’s
CGL
policy
contained
78the
underground
resources
and
equipment
exclusion. 
As
another
example,
an
operator
hires
a
contractor
to
perform
the
final
step
of
“swabbing”
the
well.
When 
the
swab
was
lowered
into
the
well,
the
swab
and
swab
line
were
lost
down
the
tubing
because
the
line 
was
not
attached
to
the
drilling
rig’s
spool.
The
contractor
was
able
to
retrieve
the
swab
and
swab
line
but 
damaged
the
well
during
the
retrieval
process.
The
damage
to
the
well
would
not
be
covered
under
the 
contractor’s
CGL
if
the
policy
was
endorsed
with
the
underground
resources
and
equipment
exclusion. 
Energy
industry
companies
with
any
underground
resources
and
equipment
exposures
should
resist
the 
attachment
of
an
underground
resources
and
equipment
exclusion
endorsement
and
should
consider 
having
the
CGL
policy
endorsed
to
provide
coverage
for
underground
resources
and
equipment 
exposures. 
Oil
or
Gas
Producing
Operations
Exclusion
The
oil
or
gas
producing
operations
exclusion
endorsement
(CG
22
73)
modifies
the
CGL’s
pollution 
exclusion
because
the
pollution
exclusion
does
not
reach
certain
off-premises
exposures
of
contractors 
when
the
work
contracted
for
does
not
involve
pollution
remediation
and
the
pollutants
in
question
were 
not
brought
on
site
by
the
contractor.
This
endorsement
bars
coverage
for
“bodily
injury”
or
“property 
damage”
arising
out
of
pollution
incidents
“at
or
from
any
premises,
site
or
location
on
which
any
insured 
or
any
contractors
or
subcontractors
working
directly
or
indirectly
on
any
insured’s
behalf
are
performing 
operations.”
This
endorsement
has
the
effect
of
removing
coverage
for
pollution
incidents
at
any
location 
where
an
insured
or
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
of
an
insured
is
performing
operations,
and,
as
a
result, 
the
pollution
exposure
to
operators,
drilling
contractors,
well
service
contractors,
and
other
contractors
is 
significant.
Parties
engaged
in
operation
of
oil
and
gas
drilling
equipment
must
typically
accept
this 
endorsement
as
part
of
their
CGL
policies.
Consequently,
energy
industry
professionals
who
are
involved 
with
the
operation
of
oil
and
gas
drilling
equipment
should
consider
the
purchase
of
pollution
liability 
insurance. 
Saline
Substances
Contamination
Exclusion
The
saline
substances
contamination
exclusion
(CG
22
47)
is
designed
to
exclude
property
damage
within 
the
“saline
substance
contamination
hazard.”
The
endorsement
defines
this
hazard
as
“property
damage” 
to
oil,
gas,
water,
or
other
mineral
substances
caused
directly
or
indirectly
by
a
saline
substance,
as
well 
as
damage
to
any
other
property
caused
by
a
saline
substance.
The
endorsement
does
not
define
“saline 
substance”;
however,
saline
substances
may
include
drilling
“mud”
or
fluid,
saltwater
pumped
into
a
well 
to
stimulate
oil
recovery,
or
saltwater
used
during
the
fracking
process.
For
example,
the
saline
substances 
contamination
exclusion
could
bar
coverage
for
expenses
incurred
by
an
operator
to
clean
up
a 
fresh-water
aquifer
if
the
aquifer
is
damaged
by
a
release
of
saltwater
into
the
aquifer
during
the
fracking 
process. 
The
saline
substances
contamination
exclusion
applies
to
oil
and
gas
lease
operations.
Its
use
is 
mandatory
for
the
two
classifications
listed
in
the
endorsement
schedule:
98150
and
98151,
oil
or
gas 
lease
operators—natural
gas. 
Failure
to
Supply
Exclusion
The
failure
to
supply
exclusion
endorsement
(CG
22
50)
is
typically
attached
to
CGL
policies
insuring 
several
classifications,
including
fuel
oil
or
biofuel
dealers
or
distributors,
gas
dealers
or
distributors,
and 
gas
companies.
When
this
endorsement
is
attached
to
a
CGL
policy,
no
coverage
is
intended
for
claim
or 
suit
involving
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising
out
of
the
failure
of
any
insured
to
adequately 
supply
any
gas,
oil,
water,
electricity,
steam,
or
biofuel.
However,
this
exclusion
does
not
apply
if
the 
failure
to
supply
results
from
the
sudden
and
accidental
injury
to
tangible
property
owned
or
used
by
any 
insured
to
procure,
produce,
process,
or
transmit
the
element
in
question. 
The
exception
is
significant
for
oil
and
gas
dealers
or
distributors.
For
example,
suppose
that
a
natural
gas 
supplier’s
natural
gas
transmission
line
is
connected
to
a
distributor’s
main
transmission
line,
and
the 
distributor’s
main
transmission
line
is
connected
to
the
service
lines
of
50,000
customers.
The
supplier’s 
mechanical
equipment
used
to
transmit
the
natural
gas
ruptures
without
warning,
resulting
in
an
79infiltration
of
air
in
the
supplier’s
transmission
line
and
the
distributor’s
main
transmission
line.
Due
to 
the
equipment
failure,
the
distributor
suffers
a
complete
loss
of
use
of
its
transmission
line
because
the
air 
infiltration
caused
a
dangerous
condition
which
required
the
distributor
to
cease
using
the
transmission 
line.
The
distributor
is
required
to
take
action
to
restore
the
line
to
use,
including
flushing
the
line,
and
the 
service
lines
of
its
50,000
customers,
over
a
period
of
several
days.
The
distributor
subsequently
seeks
to 
recover
the
expenses
it
incurred
from
the
supplier.
The
supplier’s
GCL
policy
contains
the
failure
to 
supply
exclusion
endorsement,
but
the
exclusion
might
not
bar
coverage
for
the
claim
to
the
extent
that 
the
interruption
in
the
gas
supply
to
the
distributor
and
its
customers
resulted
from
a
sudden
and 
accidental
injury
to
the
supplier’s
transmission
equipment. 
Sunset
Provisions
Some
insurance
policies
issued
to
energy
industry
companies
are
endorsed
with
a
“sunset”
provision.
A 
sunset
provision
imposes
a
time
limit
for
reporting
claims
under
the
policy.
These
provisions
essentially 
modify
the
CGL’s
“occurrence”
coverage
by
introducing
a
date
limitation
by
which
claims
must
be 
reported.
Under
a
traditional
occurrence
form,
there
is
no
time
limitation
on
when
a
claim
can
be
reported. 
Under
a
policy
with
a
sunset
provision,
the
insured
must
report
the
claim
within
the
applicable
time 
period
specified
in
the
provision
(typically
ranging
from
two
to
five
years
after
the
expiration
of
the 
policy
period).
If
the
insured
fails
to
report
the
claim
or
suit
to
the
insurer
within
the
time
period
specified 
in
the
sunset
provision,
the
policy
will
not
provide
coverage
for
the
claim
or
suit. 
This
endorsement
is
frequently
encountered
in
CGL
policies
issued
to
construction
companies,
but
it
is 
now
common
to
include
it
in
CGL
policies
issued
to
energy
industry
companies.
The
inclusion
of
such
an 
endorsement
can
leave
the
insured
with
significant
uninsured
exposures,
especially
with
respect
to 
pollution
or
other
long-tail
claims.
The
following
example
illustrates
the
effect
such
a
provision
can
have 
on
an
energy
company.
A
drilling
contractor
hires
an
equipment
contractor
to
install
new
crude
oil
storage 
tanks
on
an
onshore
drilling
rig.
The
equipment
contractor
completes
installation
of
the
storage
tanks
in 
May,
2009.
At
the
time
the
work
was
completed,
the
equipment
contractor
was
insured
under
a
CGL 
policy
with
a
policy
period
of
September
1,
2008
to
September
1,
2009.
The
CGL
has
a
sunset
clause 
requiring
the
contractor
to
report
all
claims
or
suits
to
the
insurer
within
three
years
after
the
expiration
of 
the
policy
(e.g.,
September
1,
2012).
The
equipment
contractor
negligently
installed
the
storage
tanks
and 
crude
oil
starts
being
gradually
released
into
the
soil
and
groundwater
in
June
2009.
However,
the 
pollution
is
not
detected
by
the
drilling
operator
until
October
1,
2012.
On
October
2,
2012,
the
drilling 
contractor
seeks
indemnity
from
the
equipment
contractor.
The
equipment
contractor
reports
the
claim
to 
its
insurer
that
same
day,
but
the
insurer
denies
coverage
for
the
claim
because
the
equipment
contractor 
did
not
report
the
claim
within
the
three-year
time
period
stated
in
the
sunset
clause.
Therefore,
the 
equipment
contractor
must
satisfy
its
indemnity
obligation
to
the
drilling
contractor
using
its
own
money.
Many
occurrences
involving
oil
and
gas
operations
may
not
be
visible
until
years
later,
especially 
pollution
events
that
are
gradual
in
nature.
Consequently,
energy
industry
companies
should
resist
the 
attachment
of
a
sunset
provision
endorsement
to
their
CGL
policies
as
it
represents
a
significant
reduction 
in
coverage. 
X,
C,
U
Exclusion
The
“X,
C,
U”
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
property
damage
liability
when
the
cause
of
loss
is
one
of 
the
three
designated
hazards—explosion
(X),
collapse
(C),
and
underground
property
damage
(U).
These 
hazards
may
be
excluded
individually
or
in
any
combination
by
indicating
on
the
endorsement
which
of 
the
three
hazards
is
to
be
excluded.
The
scope
of
the
exclusion
for
each
hazard
is
limited
to
property 
damage
arising
out
of
specified
causes
of
loss.
For
example,
collapse
caused
by
certain
types
of 
operations
may
be
excluded
while
collapse
caused
by
other
operations
is
not
excluded.
Under
no 
circumstances
does
the
exclusion
apply
to
liability
for
bodily
injury. 
The
X,
C,
U
hazards
exclusion
applies
only
to
property
damage
arising
out
of:
(1)
operations
in
progress 
and
(2)
operations
performed
by
the
insured.
Therefore,
the
exclusionary
endorsements
do
not
affect 
coverage
as
it
applies
to
the
products-completed
operations
hazard
or
to
the
independent
contractor 
exposure. 
80There
are
two
standard
X,
C,
U
endorsements,
which
are
identical
except
with
regard
to
the
projects
to 
which
they
apply.
The
exclusion—explosion,
collapse
and
underground
property
damage
hazard 
(specified
operations)
endorsement
(CG
21
42)
applies
the
exclusion
only
to
those
operations
(e.g., 
projects)
that
are
scheduled
in
the
endorsement.
The
other
endorsement—exclusion—explosio
n,
collapse 
and
underground
property
damage
hazard
(specified
operations
excepted)
(CG
21
43)—takes
the
opposite 
approach,
making
it
applicable
to
all
of
the
insured’s
operations
except
those
that
are
scheduled
in
the 
endorsement. 
The
explosion
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
property
damage
arising
from
blasting
operations
or
other 
explosions.
The
collapse
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
structural
property
damage
caused
by
the 
excavation
and
demolition
activities
specifically
listed
in
the
endorsement.
The
underground
property 
damage
exclusion
removes
coverage
for
property
damage
to
specifically
listed
types
of
property
(e.g., 
wires,
pipes,
tunnels,
and
sewers)
caused
by
mechanical
digging,
pile
driving,
excavating,
or
similar 
equipment. 
The
X,
C,
U
exposures
represent
significant
third-party
property
damage
exposures.
While
fairly 
substantial
premium
reductions
may
apply
when
the
exclusion
is
added
to
the
CGL
policy,
it
is
usually 
advisable
to
have
coverage
for
these
exposures.
If
an
exclusion
is
attached,
it
is
important
to
understand 
which
approach
is
used—exclusion
of
scheduled
operations
only
or
a
blanket
exclusion
with
scheduled 
exceptions. 
Total
Pollution
Exclusion
Despite
its
“absolute
pollution
exclusion”
(as
it
is
commonly
referred
to),
the
standard
CGL
policy
retains 
some
important
pollution
coverage
with
respect
to
insureds’
off-premises
operations.
First,
insureds
have 
coverage
for
third-party
bodily
injury
or
property
damage
arising
out
of
non-remedial
operations 
(operations
for
purposes
other
than
cleaning
up
pollutants)
on
property
not
owned,
rented,
or
occupied
by 
the
insured.
Second,
because
the
exclusion
only
applies
to
property
on
which
you
(the
named
insured 
operator,
drilling
contractor,
or
other
energy
industry
company)
“are
performing”
operations,
it
does
not 
reach
injury
or
damage
that
arises
out
of
the
insured’s
completed
work.
And
third,
insureds
have
coverage 
for
injury
or
damage
caused
by
smoke
or
fumes
from
a
“hostile
fire”
(one
that
has
escaped
its
intended 
boundaries)
and
emissions
from
equipment
used
to
heat
or
cool
the
contractor’s
premises. 
Insurers
can
remove
all
coverage
for
pollution
damages
from
the
CGL
by
attaching
the
standard
total 
pollution
exclusion
endorsement
to
the
policy.
Three
versions
of
this
endorsement
exist.
The
broadest
of 
the
three—CG
21
49—is
virtually
total,
with
no
exceptions.
A
second
version—CG
21
55—includes
a 
hostile
fire
exception,
and
a
third
version—CG
21
65—makes
exceptions
for
both
a
hostile
fire
and
an 
escape
of
fumes
or
other
emissions
from
equipment
used
to
heat,
cool,
or
dehumidify
the
insured’s
own 
building
premises,
or
from
a
water
heater.
All
three
versions
take
away
coverage
that
the
standard
CGL 
pollution
exclusion
left
in
place.
The
latter
two
versions
retain
coverage
for
two
categories
of
substances 
that
are
not
intended
to
be
excluded
“pollutants”
under
the
basic
CGL
policy.
The
standard
CGL
pollution 
exclusion
also
affords
coverage
for
these
substances. 
Energy
industry
companies
whose
operations
entail
direct
involvement
with
pollutants—hazardous
waste 
contractors;
contractors
working
on
an
oil
rig,
in
an
oil
refinery,
or
oil
refinery
construction;
installers
of 
underground
storage
tanks,
etc.—are
most
likely
to
have
a
total
pollution
exclusion
added
to
their 
policies,
but
some
insurers
automatically
attach
it
to
all
insureds’
policies.
Energy
industry
companies 
whose
operations
entail
direct
involvement
with
pollutants
should
resist
the
attachment
of
a
total
pollution 
exclusion,
but
if
one
cannot
be
avoided,
they
should
attempt
to
obtain
the
hostile
fire
and
heating/cooling 
equipment
exceptions. 
Contractually
Assumed
Liabilities
The
standard
CGL
policy
does
not
include
any
limitation
on
the
insured’s
contractual
liability
coverage 
with
respect
to
the
indemnitee’s
negligence.
That
is,
although
many
states
forbid
the
transfer
of
certain 
types
of
liability
in
oil
and
gas
contracts,
the
CGL
policy
does
not
differentiate.
Rather,
the
policy
will 
cover
whatever
the
law
allows.
As
long
as
the
loss
falls
within
the
indemnity
clause
and
the
indemnity 
clause
is
valid
and
enforceable,
coverage
applies
whether
the
claim
is
based
on
the
insured’s
negligence,
81joint
negligence
of
the
insured
and
the
indemnitee,
or
even
the
sole
negligence
of
the
indemnitee. 
However,
the
amendment
of
insured
contract
definition
endorsement—CG
24
26—adds
an
additional 
condition
to
the
portion
of
the
definition
of
“insured
contract”
(those
that
qualify
for
coverage
of 
contractually
assumed
liabilities)
that
applies
to
indemnity
agreements,
which
is
where
energy
industry 
companies
obtain
coverage
for
tort
liabilities
assumed
in
contracts,
equipment
leases,
and
such.
Under 
this
revised
definition,
the
injury
or
damage
that
is
the
basis
of
the
claim
must
be
“caused
in
whole
or
in 
part”
by
the
named
insured
or
those
acting
on
its
behalf.
This
change
effectively
eliminates
coverage
for 
the
insured’s
assumption
of
liability
arising
out
of
the
other
party’s
(indemnitee’s)
sole
negligence.
Where 
the
transfer
of
liability
for
one’s
sole
negligence
is
allowed,
this
restriction
could
result
in
a
coverage
gap 
for
some
companies.
Furthermore,
the
indemnitee
should
be
concerned
if
this
endorsement
is
attached
to 
the
CGL
policy
because
insurance
is
the
most
common
means
to
make
sure
an
indemnitor
is
able
to
meet 
its
contractual
indemnity
obligations.
An
indemnitor
may
have
a
contractual
obligation
to
indemnify
the 
indemnitee
but
may
not
have
the
insurance
to
fund
such
an
obligation.
Under
that
scenario,
the 
indemnitee
would
be
relying
on
the
indemnitor’s
solvency
to
honor
its
indemnity
obligations.
Operators 
and
contractors
entering
into
drilling
contracts
should
be
aware
of
the
amended
definition
of
“insured 
contract”
under
CG
24
26
and
should
take
steps
to
mitigate
the
endorsement’s
effects. 
One
good
approach
that
operators
and
drilling
contractors
can
take
is
to
obtain
a
specific
contractual 
liability
endorsement
(or,
at
a
minimum,
a
specialized
oil
and
gas
insurance
form)
that
is
crystal
clear
that 
whatever
liability
that
party
traditionally
undertakes
in
a
drilling
contract
is
covered
under
the
contractual 
liability
provision.
The
contractual
liability
endorsement
should
provide
broad
and
unambiguous
coverage 
for
the
contractual
obligations
that
the
party
typically
assumes
in
a
drilling
contract,
such
as
the
operator's 
potential
liability
for
damage
to
the
rig,
certain
pollution
liabilities,
down-hole
tools,
etc.
Therefore, 
instead
of
relying
on
the
basic
language
provided
in
an
ISO
form,
with
its
potential
pitfalls,
the
most 
prudent
step
to
take
is
to
seek
a
manuscript
endorsement
that
squarely
covers
such
typical
liabilities 
attached
to
the
CGL
policy.
Whether
an
insurer
will
provide
such
a
manuscript
contractual
liability 
endorsement
will
vary,
depending
on
such
things
as
account
size
and
insurance
market
conditions. 
Oil
Industry
Limitation
Endorsement
CGL
policies
issued
to
oil
and
gas
companies
specifically
exclude
liability
for
drilling-related
damages 
using
an
endorsement
called
an
“oil
industry
limitation
endorsement.”
There
is
no
“standard
form” 
endorsement,
and
the
wording
can
differ
from
policy
to
policy.
The
endorsement
clarifies
the
type
of 
drilling-related
damages
that
are
not
covered
under
the
policy.
For
example,
the
endorsement
might 
exclude
coverage
for: 
•
Loss
of
hole,
reservoir,
formation,
or
strata,
and
any
in-hole
equipment,
including
fishing
costs;
•
Loss
or
damage
to,
or
loss
of
use
of
property
directly
or
indirectly
resulting
from
subsidence 
caused
by
subsurface
operations
of
the
insured;
•
Removal
of
wreck
or
debris;
•
Removal
of
or
loss
to
subsurface
oil,
gas
or
any
other
substance,
or
to
the
property
of
others;
•
Property
damage
to
drilling
rigs,
drilling
or
production
platforms,
workover
rigs,
servicing
rigs, 
drilling
tools,
pipes,
supplies,
collars,
machinery,
and
equipment
leased
by
or
rented
to,
or
in
the 
care,
custody
or
control
of
any
insured;
•
Damages
claimed
by
any
co-owner
of
the
working
interest;
•
Any
professional
services
performed
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
insured,
including
but
not
limited
to
the 
preparation
or
approval
of
maps,
plans,
opinions,
report
surveys,
designs,
or
specifications,
and
any 
supervisory,
inspection,
or
engineering
services;
and
•
Pollution
liability.
The
endorsement
typically
excludes
coverage
for
damages
that
are
deemed
to
be
first-party
in
nature.
This 
makes
some
sense
because
CGL
policies
were
not
designed
to
respond
to
first
party
losses.
However,
the
82risk
allocation
system
present
in
oil
and
gas
contracts
does
not
always
follow
ownership.
Under
certain 
circumstances,
the
operator
takes
direct
responsibility
for
damage
to
the
drilling
contractor’s
property 
(third-party
property).
Damage
to
that
property
may
not
be
covered
under
the
operator’s
first-party 
property
policy.
For
example,
the
operator
could
be
contractually
liable
for
removing
the
drilling 
contractor’s
wreck
or
debris.
The
oil
industry
limitation
endorsement
would
remove
coverage
for
this
loss 
from
the
operator’s
CGL
policy
and
the
operator’s
first
party
property
policy
or
the
OEE/COW
insurance 
policy
might
not
cover
this
specific
type
of
third-party
property
damage. 
Endorsements
That
Change
the
Policy
Conditions
A
variety
of
endorsements
are
used
to
modify
policy
conditions,
such
as
how
the
limits
apply,
who
is 
insured
under
the
policy,
or
other
“non-coverage”
provisions.
While
these
endorsements
do
not
broaden 
the
scope
of
coverage
as
outlined
in
Section
I
of
the
policy,
they
can
provide
significant
extra
benefits 
under
the
policy.
Some
of
the
more
commonly
needed
changes
of
this
type
are
discussed
below. 
Designated
Location(s)
General
Aggregate
Limit
Operators
typically
have
a
single
CGL
policy
covering
liability
in
connection
with
all
of
their
wells.
To 
ensure
that
the
CGL’s
aggregate
limits
are
not
used
up
for
a
claim
in
connection
with
a
well
in
which
the 
non-operating
working
interest
owners
have
no
interest,
some
safeguard
is
required.
This
is
typically 
accomplished
by
attaching
a
designated
location(s)
general
aggregate
limit
endorsement
(CG
25
04)
to
the 
CGL
policy.
This
endorsement
structures
the
method
of
assigning
separate
general
aggregate
limits
to 
individual
insured
locations.
Endorsement
CG
25
04
provides
for
a
schedule
of
“designated
locations,”
to 
each
of
which
a
separate
“designated
location
general
aggregate
limit”
applies.
Another
policy
general 
aggregate
limit
applies
to
losses
not
associated
exclusively
with
a
scheduled
location. 
Unintentional
Failure
To
Disclose
Hazards
When
applying
for
coverage,
insureds
are
required
to
provide
a
detailed
account
of
their
operations. 
Insurers
rely
on
the
accuracy
of
this
information
in
determining
whether
to
offer
coverage
and,
if
so,
at 
what
price.
Intentional
failure
to
give
the
insurer
information
it
needs
for
these
purposes
may
jeopardize 
coverage
if
the
failure
amounts
to
a
material
misrepresentation. 
However,
sometimes
the
failure
to
disclose
is
unintentional,
as
opposed
to
an
attempt
at
fraud.
For 
example,
the
person
filling
out
the
application
may
be
unaware
of
the
insured’s
involvement
in
certain 
types
of
operations.
An
unintentional
failure
to
disclose
hazards
endorsement
ensures
that
coverage
is 
provided
for
operations
that
existed
at
the
inception
date
of
the
policy
but
were
unintentionally
not 
reported
to
the
insurer.
There
is
no
standard
endorsement
of
this
type,
but
many
insurers
have
their
own 
nonstandard
endorsement
that
will
accomplish
this
purpose. 
Waiver
of
Subrogation
The
CGL
coverage
form
contains
a
condition
that
transfers
to
the
insurer
any
insured’s
right
to
recover 
from
another
party
(i.e.,
a
third
party
legally
responsible
for
the
covered
loss)
the
amount
of
payment 
made
under
the
policy.
This
right
of
subrogation
on
the
part
of
the
insurer
must
not
be
impaired
by
any 
action
of
the
insured
after
the
loss
has
taken
place.
However,
before
a
loss,
the
insured
may
waive
its
right 
of
recovery
against
a
third
party,
and,
by
doing
so,
the
insured
automatically
waives
the
insurer’s
right 
with
respect
to
payments
made
under
the
policy
which
the
insurer
could
otherwise
recover
in
subrogation 
from
that
third
party. 
A
waiver
of
subrogation
provision
is
a
crucial
component
of
risk
allocation
in
oil
and
gas
contracts.
The 
waiver
of
subrogation
provision
prevents
the
indemnitor’s
insurer
claiming
against
the
indemnified
party 
for
its
share
of
a
loss.
Absent
a
waiver
of
subrogation
(and
putting
aside
for
the
moment
that
the 
indemnitee
should
have
additional
insured
status),
an
insurer
that
pays
a
loss
is
entitled
to
subrogate 
against
the
party
at
fault
to
the
extent
of
its
negligence
or
responsibility.
Although
an
insurance
company 
generally
cannot
subrogate
against
its
own
insured
or
even
its
additional
insured,
a
waiver
of
subrogation 
provision
in
the
CGL
policy
is
still
necessary
for
a
few
reasons.
First,
one
or
both
parties
to
the
drilling 
contract
might
have
a
nonstandard
CGL
policy
that
does
not
allow
pre-loss
waivers
of
recovery
rights
by
83the
insured.
Any
uncertainty
on
this
issue
can
be
avoided
by
attaching
a
waiver
of
subrogation 
endorsement
in
which
the
insurer
expressly
waives
any
rights
of
subrogation
against
the
other
party
to
the 
oil
and
gas
contract.
A
standard
endorsement
(CG
24
04)
exists
for
this
purpose. 
Furthermore,
it
is
not
unheard
of
for
an
administrative
error
or
misunderstanding
to
result
in
a
lack
of 
additional
insured
protection,
even
when
required
by
contract.
The
waiver
of
subrogation
serves,
to
a 
certain
extent,
as
a
backup
to
additional
insured
status.
In
fact,
sometimes
a
waiver
of
subrogation 
provides
more
protection
than
being
named
as
an
additional
insured.
An
example
might
be
helpful
to 
illustrate
how
this
could
be
possible.
Assume
that
the
operator
is
named
as
an
additional
insured
under
a 
vessel
owner’s
CGL
policy
and
a
waiver
of
subrogation
endorsement
is
attached
to
the
policy.
An
injured 
independent
contractor’s
employee
sues
both
the
operator
and
the
vessel
owner
and
the
vessel
owner’s 
insurance
pays
the
full
amount
of
the
judgment
awarded
to
the
employee.
However,
the
operator’s 
additional
insured
status
is
limited
to
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
claims
arising
solely
from
the 
charter
or
operation
of
the
vessel
itself
as
opposed
to
claims
arising
from
the
operator’s
other
activities
on 
the
vessel
(such
as
hiring
a
contractor
to
operate
a
crane
on
a
fixed
platform
of
the
vessel).
It
is
ultimately 
determined
the
operator
was
only
covered
for
a
portion
of
the
judgment
because
the
employee’s
injuries 
were
due,
in
part,
to
the
crane
operator’s
negligence
while
using
the
crane
on
the
fixed
platform
(e.g.,
an 
activity
not
related
to
the
charter
or
operation
of
the
vessel).
Since
the
vessel
owner’s
insurer
waived
its 
right
of
subrogation
against
the
operator,
the
insurer
cannot
recover
the
uninsured
portion
of
the
judgment 
from
the
operator.
Absent
such
a
waiver,
the
insurer
would
be
permitted
to
pursue
recovery
of
the 
uninsured
portion
of
the
judgment
from
the
operator. 
A
waiver
of
subrogation
in
the
context
of
a
drilling
contract
is
particularly
prudent
because
the
magnitude 
of
property
risk
is
high.
Additionally,
operators
should
seek
a
waiver
of
subrogation,
especially
as 
respects
the
contractor’s
equipment,
because
the
operator
may
not
have
coverage
for
such
equipment 
under
the
CGL
policy.
Finally,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
this
insurance
protection
should
be 
matched
to
the
indemnity
obligation.
Therefore,
the
waiver
of
subrogation
should
be
extended
to
all
of
the 
indemnified
parties
(e.g.,
the
Operator
Group
or
Contractor
Group). 
Notice
Requirements
The
CGL
policy
imposes
certain
obligations
on
each
party—the
insurer
and
the
insured—to
notify
the 
other
party
of
certain
events.
For
example,
the
insured
is
required
to
provide
timely
notice
to
the
insurer 
of
any
suit
for
damages
as
well
as
for
any
“occurrence”
that
might
give
rise
to
a
claim.
To
delay
notice 
may
prejudice
the
insurer’s
ability
to
properly
investigate,
settle,
or
defend
the
claim.
The
insurer,
on
the 
other
hand,
must
provide
sufficient
notice
to
the
insured
of
its
intent
to
cancel
the
policy.
In
that
way,
the 
insured
has
the
opportunity
to
seek
replacement
coverage
before
the
policy
expires.
Typically,
the
notice 
of
cancellation
is
30
days
or,
in
the
case
of
cancellation
for
nonpayment
of
premiums,
10
days. 
At
least
two
changes
are
routinely
needed
on
operators,
drilling
contractors,
and
other
energy
industry 
companies’
CGL
policies
with
respect
to
notice
requirements.
First,
the
policy
should
clarify
when
the 
insured
will
be
considered
“aware”
of
a
claim
or
an
occurrence.
This
type
of
modification
was
discussed 
previously
with
respect
to
the
policy’s
notice
condition.
Second,
when
an
operator’s
or
drilling 
contractor’s
insurance
is
canceled
or
not
renewed,
it
will
almost
certainly
take
longer
than
30
days
to 
arrange
satisfactory
replacement
coverage.
Energy
industry
companies
should
negotiate
a
longer
notice 
period
of
60,
90,
or
even
120
days.
In
most
instances,
endorsements
will
be
required
to
effect
these 
changes,
as
discussed
below. 
Extended
Notice
of
Cancellation,
Nonrenewal,
or
Policy
Change
The
standard
CGL
conditions
state
that
the
insurer
must
provide
30
days’
written
notice
of
cancellation, 
except
in
the
case
of
nonpayment
of
premiums,
in
which
case
only
10
days’
notice
is
required.
No 
advance
notice
is
required
of
the
insurer’s
intent
to
materially
alter
or
to
not
renew
the
policy.
In
today’s 
insurance
market,
30
days
is
simply
not
adequate
time
to
conduct
a
proper
search
for
replacement 
coverage.
Specifications
and
loss
data
may
need
to
be
prepared
for
underwriters,
site
inspections
may
be 
required,
and
questions
will
inevitably
need
to
be
answered.
Thirty
days
is
not
enough
time
to
do
all
this.
Most
states
have
notice
of
cancellation
requirements
that
supersede
the
basic
policy
requirements.
Many
84states
require
longer
notice
of
cancellation
or
nonrenewal,
and
some
states
place
limitations
on
insurers’ 
ability
to
cancel
a
policy
that
is
already
in
force.
Insurers
doing
business
in
these
states
must
attach 
mandatory
endorsements
that
bring
the
policy
into
compliance
with
the
statute.
However,
even
the
state 
requirements
may
not
offer
insureds
sufficient
protection. 
Operators,
drilling
contractors,
and
other
energy
industry
companies
should
take
this
issue
up
with
the 
underwriter
and
negotiate
reasonable
notice
of
cancellation.
Ideally,
it
would
provide
equal
notice
of 
nonrenewal
and
material
changes
in
coverage.
At
a
minimum,
operators
and
drilling
contractors
should 
negotiate
60
days’
notice,
and
90
days
is
preferable.
Negotiation
of
an
even
longer
period
of
time (e.g., 
120
days)
is
possible
in
some
situations.
ISO
publishes
the
earlier
notice
of
cancellation
endorsement
(CG 
02
24)
that
modifies
the
required
notice
of
cancellation
to
the
number
of
days
stated
in
the
endorsement 
schedule.
However,
this
endorsement
does
not
require
notice
of
nonrenewal
or
material
policy
change. 
Some
insurers’
nonstandard
endorsements
also
require
extended
notice
of
nonrenewal,
but
a
manuscript 
endorsement
is
often
required
to
obtain
a
required
notice
of
material
policy
change. 
Modified
Notice
of
Occurrence
The
CGL
policy
conditions
state
that
in
the
event
of
an
occurrence,
notice
shall
be
given
to
the
insurer
“as 
soon
as
practicable.”
Failure
to
comply
with
this
provision
may
void
coverage.
However,
the
notice 
requirements
in
the
standard
CGL
policy
may
not
provide
adequate
protection
to
the
insured.
For 
example,
the
policy
does
not
qualify
what
it
means
to
provide
“timely”
notice
upon
becoming
aware
of
a 
claim
or
an
occurrence.
If
a
worker
on
a
drilling
site
witnesses
something
that
could
result
in
a
claim
but 
does
not
report
it
to
someone
with
authority
to
give
notice,
or
even
to
the
worker’s
supervisor
or
a
project 
supervisor
(who
has
the
responsibility
to
report
such
incidents),
is
the
company
in
violation
of
its 
obligation
to
provide
timely
notice? 
A
modified
notice
of
occurrence
endorsement,
which
must
be
worded
on
a
nonstandard
or
manuscript 
basis,
specifies
when
exactly
the
insured
is
considered
to
have
knowledge
of
an
occurrence.
Specifically, 
the
insured
will
be
deemed
to
have
knowledge
of
a
claim
when
the
individual
specified
in
the 
endorsement
schedule
receives
information
pertaining
to
the
loss.
The
most
favorable
modification
would 
be
to
name
the
highest-ranking
position
in
the
organization
(e.g.,
president/CEO);
the
least
favorable 
would
be
to
name
the
drilling
site
supervisor,
because
he
or
she
will
probably
be
one
of
the
first
people
to 
know.
A
reasonable
compromise
is
to
name
the
position
of
risk
manager
or,
in
some
cases,
the
vice 
president
of
finance
as
the
person
responsible
for
reporting
claims
in
a
timely
manner.
This
modification 
is
particularly
important
in
large
organizations
where
employees
may
have
knowledge
of
a
loss
and
not 
report
it
to
management. 
“Who
Is
an
Insured”
Endorsements
Various
changes
can
or
should
be
made
to
the
“who
is
an
insured”
provision
of
the
CGL
policy.
One 
often-overlooked
modification
ensures
that
all
of
the
insured’s
related
entities
are
covered
under
the 
policy.
Likewise,
operators
that
engage
in
joint
ventures
may
need
to
modify
their
policies
to
ensure 
adequate
protection,
even
if
the
joint
venture
is
separately
insured.
And
virtually
all
operators,
drilling 
contractors,
well
service
contractors,
and
other
energy
industry
companies
will
need
to
occasionally
add 
other
parties
to
their
policies
as
additional
insureds,
and
most
do
so
quite
frequently.
Operators,
drilling 
contractors,
and
other
energy
industry
companies
need
to
understand
the
scope
of
coverage
that
both 
standard
and
nonstandard
endorsements
provide
to
additional
insureds
to
ensure
the
adequacy
of
the 
coverage.
A
number
of
key
endorsements
that
modify
the
“who
is
an
insured”
provision
to
include 
additional
parties
are
discussed
below. 
Broad
Form
Named
Insured
Endorsement
Recall
that
the
named
insured
in
the
CGL
policy
is
defined
as
the
person
or
entity
specified
as
such
in
the 
policy
declarations.
Subsidiaries
of
a
named
insured
are
not
automatically
covered
under
the
standard 
policy
form.
Each
related
entity
must
be
specifically
listed
to
ensure
coverage
for
that
entity.
Similarly, 
joint
ventures
are
not
automatically
covered
under
the
CGL
policy.
In
fact,
they
are
specifically
excluded 
unless
they
are
listed
on
the
policy
declarations
as
insureds.
Two
endorsements
used
to
address
joint
85venture
coverage
are
discussed
in
more
detail
below. 
A
broad
form
named
insured
endorsement
provides
automatic
coverage
for
all
subsidiary,
affiliated, 
associated,
controlled,
or
allied
companies,
or
corporations
of
the
named
insured
company.
There
is
no 
standard
endorsement
for
this
purpose,
but
most
insurers
have
their
own
nonstandard
versions.
The 
individual
entities
do
not
have
to
be
listed
on
the
endorsement
to
be
covered.
This
type
of
endorsement 
avoids
oversights
in
adding
new
acquisitions
or
newly
formed
organizations
to
the
policy,
as
well
as 
simple
errors
in
listing
related
entities. 
Injury
to
a
Fellow
Employee
Under
the
workers
compensation
laws
of
most
states,
the
benefits
provided
under
the
law
are
intended
to 
be
the
“exclusive
remedy”
available
to
an
injured
employee.
However,
methods
of
getting
around
this 
concept
of
exclusive
remedy
have
developed
over
the
years.
One
such
technique
is
that
of
suing
a
fellow 
employee
whose
negligence
somehow
contributed
to
or
caused
the
loss.
Supervisors
and
safety
directors 
are
among
the
most
likely
targets
of
suits
alleging
failure
to
maintain
a
safe
working
environment
or 
similar
allegations. 
As
previously
discussed,
even
though
employees
are
insureds
under
the
CGL,
they
are
not
insureds
with 
respect
to
suits
brought
by
another
employee.
(Suits
brought
by
employees
against
“executive
officers” 
are
covered.)
An
injury
to
a
fellow
employee
endorsement
modifies
the
“who
is
an
insured”
provision
to 
provide
insured
status
for
specified
employees
with
regard
to
a
suit
brought
by
a
coworker.
The 
endorsement,
always
written
on
a
nonstandard
or
manuscript
basis,
will
normally
specify
the
employees 
to
which
it
applies
either
by
name
or
by
position
or
function.
Using
broad
classes
of
employees
such
as 
“all
of
operator’s
supervisors
and
loss
prevention
personnel”
is
generally
a
better
approach
than
naming 
individuals
as
it
prevents
unintended
gaps
when
a
new
employee
is
hired
but
not
added
to
the 
endorsement. 
Additional
Insured
Endorsements
As
previously
discussed,
contracts
play
a
key
role
in
the
energy
industry,
and
one
of
the
major
insurance 
protections
that
is
commonly
required
by
indemnified
parties
is
being
named
as
an
additional
insured.
For 
example,
an
operator
typically
requires
that
it
and
the
Operator
Group
be
named
as
additional
insureds 
under
the
drilling
contractor’s
insurance
policies.
Likewise,
the
drilling
contractor
typically
requires
that 
it
and
the
Contractor
Group
be
named
as
additional
insureds
under
the
operator’s
insurance
policies.
In 
the
context
of
service
contracts,
an
operator
may
require
that
its
subcontractors
name
it
as
an
additional 
insured
under
the
subcontractors’
insurance
policies.
Drilling
contractors
typically
require
the
same
from 
their
subcontractors. 
Just
as
with
waivers
of
subrogation
and
primary
and
non-contributory
endorsements,
it
is
important
to 
remember
that
additional
insured
status
should
be
matched
to
the
indemnity
obligation
under
the 
particular
contract.
This
means
additional
insured
status
should
be
extended
to
all
of
the
indemnified 
parties
(e.g.,
the
Operator
Group
or
Contractor
Group). 
In
the
energy
industry,
an
additional
insured’s
coverage
typically
mirrors
the
obligation
assumed
in
the 
indemnity
agreement
in
the
particular
contract.
Since
many
energy
contracts
require
mutual
or
reciprocal 
indemnity,
each
party
to
the
contract
should
be
named
as
an
additional
insured
on
the
other
party’s 
insurance.
Furthermore,
the
additional
insured
endorsement,
should
spell
out
the
scope
of
the
additional 
insured’s
coverage.
For
example,
coverage
for
each
party
should
be
limited
“to
the
extent
of
the
risks
and 
liabilities
assumed”
by
the
other
party
under
the
contract’s
indemnity
provision.
Otherwise,
the
additional 
insured
would
have
coverage
for
liability
in
connection
with
its
independent
business
activities
that
have 
no
connection
to
the
oil
and
gas
operations
specified
in
the
contract. 
To
accomplish
the
appropriate
limitations,
ISO
publishes
a
variety
of
standard
additional
insured 
endorsements
for
naming
various
types
of
entities
as
additional
insureds.
The
scope
of
coverage
provided 
under
each
endorsement
will
reflect
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
named
insured
and
the 
additional
insured,
including
any
limitations
on
coverage.
For
example,
the
additional
insured 
endorsement
for
entities
that
have
a
nonoperating
working
interest
in
an
oil
or
gas
lease
provides
86additional
insured
coverage
for
nonoperators,
but
limits
the
coverage
to
the
nonoperators’
liability
arising 
out
of
their
working
interest.
Similarly,
the
additional
insured
endorsements
for
owners,
lessees,
and 
contractors
will
explicitly
exclude
coverage
for
the
named
insured’s
completed
operations.
In
some
cases, 
however,
a
manuscript
approach—involving
modification
of
standard
endorsement
language
or
the 
drafting
of
an
entirely
new,
nonstandard
endorsement—becomes
necessary
to
address
unique
coverage 
needs. 
The
unique
risk
allocation
system
in
oil
and
gas
contracts
has
an
impact
on
the
appropriate
scope
of 
coverage
for
additional
insureds.
As
previously
noted,
the
additional
insured’s
coverage
should
mirror
the 
obligations
under
the
indemnity
agreement.
Under
this
approach,
the
coverage
provided
to
the
additional 
insured
would,
in
many
instances,
include
liability
arising
out
of
the
contributory
negligence
of
the 
additional
insured
(intermediate
form
indemnity).
The
scope
of
additional
insured
coverage
should
not
be 
limited
to
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
insured
or
those
acting
on
the
insured’s
behalf.
Since
risk
is 
typically
allocated
without
regard
to
fault,
additional
insured
coverage
is
needed
for
the
acts
or
omissions 
of
the
additional
insured
and
the
additional
insured’s
group
(Operator
Group
or
Contractor
Group).
For 
the
very
same
reason,
the
scope
of
additional
insured
coverage
should
not
be
limited
to
ongoing 
operations.
Additional
insured
coverage
for
completed
operations
is
needed.
Similarly,
the
scope
of 
additional
insured
coverage
should
not
be
limited
to
a
party’s
vicarious
liability
for
the
actions
of
its 
group
and
should
not
specifically
exclude
a
party’s
sole
negligence.
One
way
to
address
this
issue
is
to 
use
alternative
wording
in
an
additional
insured
endorsement
which
states
that
coverage
under
the 
endorsement,
“…shall
not
specifically
exclude
sole
negligence.”
The
scope
of
coverage
provided
to 
additional
insureds
has
been
gradually
eroded
in
the
past
several
years.
The
evolution
of
this
coverage
is 
examined
at
length
in
the
“Contractual
Risk
Transfer
in
the
Energy
Industry”
course.
The
scope
of 
coverage
provided
under
the
current
editions
of
the
standard
additional
insured
endorsements
(effective
in 
April
2013
in
most
jurisdictions)
is
examined
below.
Also
examined
below
are
some
manuscript
and 
nonstandard
approaches
to
tailor
the
provisions
of
additional
insured
coverage
to
suit
the
needs
of 
contractual
relationships
in
the
energy
industry.

Oil
and
Gas
Operations—Non-Operating,
Working
Interests
As
previously
noted,
a
nonoperating
working
interest
in
an
oil
or
gas
drilling
operation
refers
to
an 
investor
in
the
venture
who
does
not
participate
in
the
management
of
the
project.
A
nonoperating 
working
interest
owner
is
a
partner
and
is
usually
added
as
an
additional
insured
on
the
CGL
policy
of
the 
operator
who
has
control
of
the
project.
The
Oil
and
Gas
Operations—Non-Operating
Working
Interests 
endorsement
(CG
20
30)
is
used
for
that
purpose. 
The
endorsement
adds
as
an
insured
any
owner,
co-owner,
joint
venturer,
mining
partner,
or
limited 
liability
company
having
a
nonoperating
working
interest
in
any
oil
or
gas
lease
operated
by
the
named 
insured,
but
only
with
respect
to
their
liability
arising
out
of
such
interest.
The
extension
of
insured
status 
to
a
partner
or
joint
venturer
in
a
partnership
or
joint
venture
that
is
not
listed
as
a
named
insured
under 
the
policy
could
conflict
with
one
provision
of
the
CGL
"Who
Is
an
Insured"
section,
which
stipulates
that 
no
person
or
organization
is
an
insured
for
the
conduct
of
any
current
or
past
partnership,
joint
venture,
or 
limited
liability
company
that
is
not
shown
in
the
policy
declarations
as
a
named
insured.
To
avoid
any 
such
conflict,
endorsement
CG
20
30
specifies
that
the
"Who
Is
an
Insured"
limitation
with
respect
to
any
88partnership,
joint
venture,
or
limited
liability
not
shown
as
a
named
insured
in
the
policy
declarations 
does
not
apply
to
the
extent
coverage
would
be
afforded
under
this
endorsement. 
The
current
edition
of
CG
20
30
contains
significant
limitations
to
the
scope
of
additional
insured 
coverage.
First,
additional
insured
coverage
only
applies
“to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.”
Second,
if 
coverage
provided
to
the
additional
insured
is
required
by
a
contract
or
agreement,
coverage
will
not
be 
broader
than
required
in
the
contract,
and
the
most
the
insurer
will
pay
on
behalf
of
the
additional
insured 
is
the
lesser
of:
(a)
the
amount
required
in
the
contract
or
agreement
or
(b)
the
amount
available
under
the 
applicable
limit
of
insurance
that
appears
in
the
policy
declarations.
These
limitations
are
prevalent
in
the 
other
standard
additional
insured
endorsements
discussed
in
below. 
Designated
Person
or
Organization
Most
standard
additional
insured
endorsements
are
written
to
address
one
of
two
sets
of
loss 
exposures—those
that
arise
from
the
named
insured's
services
or
operations,
and
those
that
arise
in 
connection
with
the
named
insured's
premises.
These
endorsements
are
tailored
specifically
to
each
loss 
exposure
and
usually
contain
conditions
and
exclusions
specific
to
either
business
operations
or
business 
premises.
The
Additional
Insured—Designated
Person
or
Organization
endorsement
(CG
20
26), 
however,
is
designed
to
address
in
a
more
generic
way
either
set
of
loss
exposures.
It
covers
injury
or 
damage
caused
by
the
named
insured's
acts
or
omissions
in
performance
of
the
named
insured's
ongoing 
operations,
in
connection
with
the
named
insured's
premises,
or
both.
It
is
used,
in
effect,
as
an
"all
other" 
endorsement
when
no
endorsement
more
specific
to
the
relationship
between
the
named
and
additional 
insureds
is
available.
For
example,
CG
20
26
might
be
used
in
connection
with
additional
insured 
coverage
required
by
mineral
leases
and
farmout
agreements,
since
there
is
no
standard
endorsement 
covering
such
relationships.
It
provides
coverage
for
the
additional
insured
with
respect
to
the
named 
insured’s
operations
and
in
connection
with
premises
owned
by
or
rented
by
the
named
insured. 
Therefore,
the
endorsement
could
be
used
in
situations
where
CG
20
10
would
be
more
customarily
used 
to
provide
insured
status
to
an
upstream
party
under
one
of
its
subcontractors’
policies
or
when
a
lessor’s 
interest
endorsement
is
used
to
make
a
property
owner
an
insured
under
the
policy
of
a
tenant. 
Note
that
CG
20
26
is
similar
to
other
standard
additional
insured
endorsements,
particularly
in
the
way
in 
which
insured
status
for
the
designated
person
or
organization
is
triggered:
injury
or
damage
must
be 
caused
at
least
in
part
by
an
act
or
omission
of
the
named
insured
or
someone
acting
on
the
named 
insured's
behalf.
Recall
that
the
scope
of
additional
insured
coverage
should
not
be
limited
to
the
acts
or 
omissions
of
the
insured
or
those
acting
on
the
insured’s
behalf.
Instead,
additional
insured
coverage
is 
needed
for
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
additional
insured
and
the
additional
insured’s
group.
Therefore, 
operators
and
drilling
contractors
should
seek
to
have
the
language
of
CG
20
26
modified
to
encompass 
their
respective
groups
or
should
use
a
manuscript
endorsement
to
accomplish
this
purpose. 
The
current
edition
of
CG
20
26
contains
the
same
“ongoing
operations”
limitations
as
other
similar 
endorsements.
Coverage
for
completed
operations
is
excluded
under
the
endorsement.
A
different 
endorsement,
CG
20
37
(discussed
in
greater
detail
below),
is
now
the
only
standard
form
that 
unequivocally
provides
additional
insureds
with
completed
operations
coverage.
Since
the
scope
of 
additional
insured
coverage
should
not
be
limited
to
“ongoing
operations,”
operators
and
drilling 
contractors
should
seek
to
have
endorsement
CG
20
37
attached
to
their
policies
or
should
use
a 
manuscript
endorsement
that
does
not
impose
the
“ongoing
operations”
limitations

Owners,
Lessees,
or

The
ISO
portfolio
of
additional
insured
endorsements
includes
two
endorsements
for
making
individual 
project
owners,
lessees,
or
contractors
additional
insureds
under
the
policy.
CG
20
10
provides
the
89additional
insured
with
coverage
during
the
performance
of
the
named
insured’s
ongoing
operations
and 
CG
20
37
provides
additional
insured
status
with
respect
to
the
products-completed
operations
hazard
in 
connection
with
the
named
insured's
work. 
The
“Additional
Insured—Owners,
Lessees
or
Contractors—Scheduled
Person
or
Organization” 
endorsement,
commonly
referred
to
by
its
form
number,
CG
20
10,
is
frequently
used
to
create
insured 
status
under
a
service
provider's
CGL
policy
for
the
person
or
organization
for
which
the
service
is
being 
provided,
and
is
generally
associated
with
construction-related
contracts
where
the
upstream
party
is 
seeking
additional
insured
coverage
under
a
downstream
party’s
insurance
policy.
It
provides
additional 
insured
coverage
on
a
scheduled
basis,
to
the
person
or
organization
named
in
the
endorsement
with 
respect
to
bodily
injury,
property
damage,
or
personal/advertising
injury
liability
arising
from
the
named 
insured’s
acts
or
omissions
or
those
acting
on
the
named
insured’s
behalf
in
the
performance
of
the
named 
insured’s
ongoing
operations
at
the
scheduled
job
sites.
There
are
some
significant
restrictions
on
the 
coverage
provided
under
the
endorsement
that
are
problematic
for
energy
industry
companies.
First,
it 
covers
the
additional
insured
only
for
premises-operations
liability.
This
is
accomplished
not
only
by 
limiting
the
additional
insured’s
coverage
to
liability
sustained
in
connection
with
the
named
insured’s 
“ongoing
operations”
for
the
additional
insured
but
also
by
a
specific
statement
that
coverage
does
not 
apply
to
liability
included
within
the
completed
operations
hazard.
Further,
coverage
applies
only
with 
respect
to
losses
caused,
in
whole
or
in
part,
by
an
act
or
omission
of
the
named
insured
contractor
or 
someone
acting
on
its
behalf
(no
coverage
for
the
additional
insured’s
sole
negligence).
As
previously 
discussed,
restricting
the
scope
of
additional
insured
coverage
to
“ongoing
operations”
is
not 
recommended.
Operators
and
drilling
contractors
should
seek
to
have
the
completed
operations
coverage 
endorsement
(CG
20
37)
attached
to
their
policies
or
should
use
a
manuscript
endorsement
that
does
not 
impose
the
“ongoing
operations”
limitations
on
additional
insured
coverage.
Moreover,
limiting
the
scope 
of
additional
insured
coverage
to
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
named
insured
or
those
acting
on
the
named 
insured’s
behalf
is
not
recommended.
Operators
and
drilling
contractors
should
seek
to
have
the
language 
of
CG
20
10
modified
to
encompass
their
respective
groups
or
should
use
a
manuscript
endorsement
to 
accomplish
this
purpose. 
Coverage
under
the
current
edition
of
CG
20
10
is
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
regarding
state
law, 
coverage
not
being
broader
than
the
underlying
contract
requirements
between
the
named
insured
and 
additional
insured,
and
the
dollar
amount
the
insurer
will
pay
on
behalf
of
the
additional
insured
that
are 
discussed
in

The
Additional
Insured
–
Owners,
Lessees

Contractors
–
Completed
Operation
endorsement 
(CG
20
37)
is
used
to
provide
the
additional
insured
status
with
respect
to
the
products-completed 
operations
hazard
in
connection
with
the
named
insured's
work.
Both
the
additional
insured
person
or 
organization
and
the
location
and
description
of
the
completed
operations
must
be
scheduled
in
the 
endorsement.
This
endorsement
is
designed
to
be
complementary
to
those
that
provide
ongoing 
operations
coverage
(such
as
CG
20
26
and
CG
20
10),
picking
up
where
those
endorsements
leave
off. 
Under
CG
20
37,
no
coverage
is
afforded
while
operations
are
still
in
progress.
Rather,
coverage
applies 
only
to
liability
arising
out
of
the
named
insured’s
operations
that
fall
within
the
policy’s 
“products-completed
operations
hazard.”
An
operation
is
defined
as
completed
at
the
earliest
of
the 
following
events. 
•
All
work
called
for
in
the
contract
has
been
completed.
•
All
work
to
be
done
at
a
specific
job
site
has
been
completed
(if
the
contract
calls
for
work
at
more 
than
one
site).
•
That
part
of
the
work
done
at
a
job
site
has
been
put
to
its
intended
use
by
anyone
other
than 
another
contractor
or
subcontractor
working
on
the
same
project.
90Using
a
separate
endorsement
to
provide
completed
operations
coverage
to
additional
insureds
allows 
insurers
to
underwrite
and
price
the
exposure
separately
based
on
the
nature
of
the
specific
risk.
However, 
insurers
are
not
required
to
provide
the
completed
operations
endorsement
just
because
they
provided
the 
ongoing
operations
endorsement;
it
is
provided
at
their
discretion.
As
with
the
other
standard 
endorsements,
coverage
applies
only
with
respect
to
losses
caused,
in
whole
or
in
part,
by
an
act
or 
omission
of
the
named
insured
or
someone
acting
on
its
behalf
(no
coverage
for
the
additional
insured’s 
sole
negligence).
As
previously
discussed,
this
limitation
is
problematic.
Operators
and
drilling 
contractors
should
seek
to
have
the
language
of
CG
20
37
modified
to

their

or
should

a

Automatic
(“Blanket”)
Additional
Insured
Endorsements
An
additional
insured
requirement
in
the
energy
industry
contract
does
not
automatically
translate
into 
additional
insured
status
on
the
applicable
insurance
policy.
Companies
must
follow
through
to
make
this 
happen
by
instructing
their
agent
or
broker
to
add
the
designated
party
as
an
additional
insured,
and
the 
agent
or
broker
must
follow
through
by
submitting
the
request
to
the
insurance
company.
Because
people 
make
errors,
there
are
times
when
a
request
for
additional
insured
status
does
not
reach
the
insurance 
company.
In
that
case,
the
company
is
in
breach
of
its
contractual
obligation,
and
to
the
extent
the
other 
party
suffers
an
uninsured
loss
due
to
this
error,
the
company
may
have
to
pay
the
difference
out
of
its 
own
pocket.
(If
there
is
an
indemnity
agreement,
some
of
the
loss
may
be
covered
as
contractual
liability.)
Automatic
additional
insured
endorsements,
commonly
referred
to
as
“blanket”
endorsements,
provide
a 
way
to
avoid
the
risk
of
oversight
in
executing
a
request
for
additional
insured
status.
ISO
publishes
two 
automatic
additional
insured
endorsements
which
are
primarily
used
in
conjunction
with
construction 
contracts
and
equipment
leases.
However,
a
standard
endorsement
may
not
always
suit
the
coverage 
needs
of
the
additional
insureds
or
those
providing
the
additional
insured
status.
In
such
cases,
manuscript 
language
must
be
drafted
to
define
the
scope
of
additional
insured
coverage. 
There
is
a
danger
in
crafting
automatic
additional
insured
endorsements
that
are
too
broad
in
the
scope
of 
contractual
obligations
they
address.
A
blanket
endorsement
addressing
the
named
insured's
obligations 
under
"all
written
contracts,"
for
example,
could
provide
broader
coverage
than
necessary—or
less 
coverage
than
required.
Consequently,
endorsements
providing
automatic
additional
insured
status
should 
be
very
specific
as
to
the
types
of
contracts
to
which
they
relate
in
order
to
assure
that
appropriate 
coverage
terms
and
limitations
will
apply.
Given
the
unique
nature
of
risk
allocation
in
the
oil
and
gas 
industry,
and
the
multiple
parties
involved
in
oil
and
gas
operations,
blanket
automatic
additional
insured 
endorsements
should
be
used
with
caution. 
Additional
Insured
Coverage
Matching
Indemnity
Obligation
91As
previously
discussed,
the
scope
of
an
additional
insured’s
coverage
should
mirror
the
indemnity 
obligation
in
the
energy
contract.
One
way
to
achieve
such
additional
insured
status
is
to
use
a 
nonstandard
additional
insured
endorsement
in
which
the
additional
insured
coverage
may
be
shaped
by 
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
named
and
additional
insureds.
Such
an
endorsement
would 
extend
insured
status
to
the
named
insured’s
indemnitees
listed
in
the
endorsement
schedule.
Coverage 
would
apply
to
the
additional
insured’s
liability
to
the
extent
that
the
person
or
organization
is 
indemnified
by
the
named
insured’s
written
contract
or
agreement
with
the
additional
insured.
In
other 
words,
coverage
applies
to
the
additional
insured's
liability
only
to
the
extent
to
which
the
additional 
insured
has
also
been
indemnified
by
the
named
insured
and
not
beyond
the
coverage
scope
of
the
CGL 
policy
itself. 
92Chapter 9
Umbrella Liability Insurance
93Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn how to…
1. explain the functions of umbrella liability insurance and contrast the
coverage available under a typical umbrella policy with that of the
standard CGL policy and
2. illustrate the major ways in which an oil industry limitation endorsement
alters the coverage of an umbrella policy.
An umbrella  liability policy provides excess limits of coverage,  over and above the limits provided in 
various basic liability policies. Specifically,  most umbrella liability policies provide excess coverage over 
the firm’s general liability, auto liability, and employers  liability insurance.  However,  umbrella liability 
policies can also sit in excess of other energy industry-specific  underlying  coverage such as maritime 
employers  liability, non-owned  and chartered vessel liability, and aviation liability insurance.  The 
umbrella policy is a crucial element of an energy industry company’s  insurance  program as it provides 
protection  for catastrophic  losses. In addition  to its high limits of liability,  the umbrella policy may afford 
a broader scope of coverage  than do the primary liability policies.Scope of Coverage
Unlike primary (underlying)  liability policies, umbrella liability forms are not standardized,  which means 
each insurer develops its own form.  Although  similarities  exist, substantial  differences  also exist. Many 
insurance  professionals  mistakenly  believe that if a particular  coverage is provided in an underlying  
policy, then it is automatically  provided in the umbrella policy. This is not true. The only way to know for 
sure what a particular  umbrella form covers is to read it in its entirety.
Insuring  Agreement
The insuring agreement  of virtually  all umbrella policies provides coverage for “personal  injury,”
“property  damage,”  and “advertising  liability.”  Personal injury has a different meaning in the umbrella 
than it does in the CGL policy. In the CGL policy, personal injury refers to non-bodily  injuries (offenses)  
such as false arrest, libel, and slander. In the umbrella,  “personal  injury” encompasses  both bodily injury 
and non-bodily  injury. The umbrella definition  of “personal  injury” usually includes perils such as shock, 
mental anguish, mental injury, and, in some policies, humiliation  and discrimination.  “Property  damage” 
usually includes liability for actual  damage to or destruction  of tangible  property as well as loss of use of 
property.
The insuring agreement  can be written on either an “indemnify”  or “pay on behalf of” basis. The 
difference  between these two obligations  is significant.  A promise  to “indemnify”  the insured allows the 
insurer to wait for an award of damages  to be paid and then reimburse  the insured for the covered costs. A 
promise to “pay on behalf of the insured,” however, obligates the insurer to pay covered damages and 
defense costs as they are incurred. The insured, in other words, does  not have to front the money and wait 
for reimbursement  from the insurer.
Umbrella  coverage is written on an “occurrence”  basis, and the definition  of “occurrence”  is typically 
similar to that found in the CGL policy. That is, it applies to an “accident,”  including  continuous  or 
repeated exposure to harmful conditions.  However,  because the CGL policy also provides excess 
coverage for personal and advertising  injury, as well as employers  liability and auto liability claims, the 
umbrella definition  should also include broader terms that will trigger coverage,  such as “happenings  or 
events.”
In general, the scope of umbrella  coverage is worldwide.  In other words, the  policy affords coverage 
anywhere  in the world. Certain policies, however, require that suits be brought in the United States or 
Canada.
Many umbrellas  contain a separate defense insuring agreement  that identifies the defense obligations  of 
the insurer. Some umbrellas  cover defense costs in addition to the policy limits, while others cover

liability
on
the
part
of
the
insured
but
this
coverage
might
be
absent
in
an
umbrella
policy.
Furthermore, 
certain
CGL
policies
provide
coverage
for
cleanup
of
underground
pollutants
but
coverage
for
such 
pollution
does
not
exist
in
the
umbrella
policy. 
Moreover,
the
type
of
pollution
exclusion
can
differ
from
umbrella
policy
to
umbrella
policy,
if
the 
exclusion
does
not
follow
form
to
the
underlying
liability
policy.
Certain
umbrella
policies
might
have
an 
absolute
pollution
exclusion
whereas
other
umbrella
policies
might
contain
a
sudden
and
accidental 
pollution
exclusion
or
a
named
perils
pollution
exclusion.
In
sum,
one
should
not
assume
that
the 
pollution
coverage
afforded
by
the
umbrella
policy
is
identical
to
that
provided
by
the
primary
liability 
policy,
and
an
umbrella
policy’s
pollution
exclusion
should
be
carefully
reviewed
to
avoid
possible 
coverage
deficiencies. 
Oil
Industry
Limitation
Endorsement
Like
CGL
policies,
umbrella
policies
issued
to
oil
and
gas
companies
typically
include
the
“oil
industry 
limitation
endorsement.”
Like
the
endorsement
attached
to
the
CGL
policy,
this
endorsement
clarifies
the 
type
of
drilling-related
damages
that
are
not
covered
under
the
umbrella
policy. 
The
endorsement
typically
excepts
coverage
for
damages
that
are
deemed
to
be
first-party
in
nature.
This 
makes
some
sense
because
primary
and
umbrella
liability
policies
were
not
designed
to
respond
to
first 
party
losses.
However,
the
risk
allocation
system
present
in
oil
and
gas
contracts
does
not
always
follow 
ownership.
Under
certain
circumstances,
the
operator
takes
direct
responsibility
for
damage
to
the
drilling 
contractor’s
property
(third-party
property).
Damage
to
that
property
may
not
be
covered
under
the 
operator’s
first-party
property
policy.
For
example,
the
operator
could
be
contractually
liable
for 
removing
the
drilling
contractor’s
wreck
or
debris.
The
oil
industry
limitation
endorsement
would
remove 
coverage
for
this
loss
from
the
operator’s
umbrella
policy
and
the
operator’s
first
party
property
policy
or 
the
OEE/COW
insurance
policy
might
not
cover
this
specific
type
of
third-party
property
damage. 
Therefore,
attaching
this
endorsement
to
an
operator’s
umbrella
policy
could
result
in
a
significant 
uninsured
exposure. 
Consider
the
following
example.
An
operator
has
an
OEE/COW
policy
which
provides
for
$5
million
in 
coverage
for
costs
incurred
because
of
a
well
failure.
A
blowout
occurs
in
April
2012.
At
the
time
of
the 
blowout,
the
OEE/COW
policy
is
in
effect
and
the
operator
is
also
insured
under
a
CGL
and
umbrella 
policy;
however,
the
CGL
policy
does
not
cover
expenses
associated
with
control
of
wells.
The
operator’s 
expenses
for
controlling
the
well,
removing
debris
and
wreckage,
and
remediating
pollution
exceed
$20 
million,
well
above
the
$5
million
limit
of
the
OEE/COW
policy.
The
operator
seeks
coverage
for
the 
expenses
under
the
umbrella
policy.
The
umbrellainsurer
denies
coverage,
because
the
oil
industry 
limitation
endorsement
is
attached,
and
it
specifically
excludes
coverage
for
costs
and
expenses
incurred 
in
bringing
a
well
under
control.
Consequently,
the
operator
has
a
$15
million
coverage
deficiency
with 
respect
to
the
expenses
it
incurred
in
connection
with
the
blowout. 
Like
the
endorsement
to
the
CGL
policy,
there
is
no
“standard
form”
oil
industry
limitation
endorsement. 
The
wording
of
the
endorsement
can
differ
from
policy
to
policy.
Oil
industry
limitation
endorsements
in 
umbrella
policies
should
be
carefully
reviewed
because
some
forms
of
the
endorsement
contain 
limitations
that
create
coverage
deficiencies
as
well
as
limitations
that
are
more
restrictive
than
the 
exclusions
contained
in
the
CGL
policy. 
Professional
Services
Liability
Exclusion
Umbrella
policies
may
contain
a
designated
professional
services
exclusion
or
may
follow
form
to
the 
designated
professional
services
exclusion
in
the
CGL
policy.
Professional
services
exclusions
are
broad 
and
can
result
in
unanticipated
exposures,
especially
since
one
party
to
energy
industry
contracts
(e.g.,
the 
operator)
may
be
required
to
indemnify
another
party
(e.g.,
the
drilling
contractor)
for
the
consultant’s 
negligence
if
the
operator’s
group
includes
a
consultant
providing
professional
services.
Operators
and 
drilling
contractors
need
to
be
aware
of
the
reduction
in
coverage
that
this
exclusion
creates.
Energy 
industry
companies
with
any
professional
liability
exposure
should
consider
the
purchase
of
oil
and
gas 
professional
liability
insurance.
96“Property
Damage”
Exclusions
Umbrellas
typically
contain
a
number
of
“property
damage”
exclusions.
The
impact
of
the
“property 
damage”
exclusions
will
differ
depending
on
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties.
For 
example,
a
master
service
agreement
might
require
an
operator
to
be
responsible
for
damage
to
the 
drilling
rig
or
the
drilling
contractor’s
tools
even
though
the
damage
occurred
when
the
drilling
contractor 
was
using
the
tools.
Under
a
different
scenario,
an
operator
or
drilling
contractor
might
enter
into 
contracts
where
work
other
than
oil
or
gas
exploration
activities
is
to
be
performed
(such
as
construction 
of
a
new
drilling
platform
or
construction
of
a
pipeline
or
installation
of
drilling
equipment)
and
the
risk 
allocation
scheme
under
those
contracts
may
require
the
downstream
party
to
be
responsible
for
property 
damage.
Either
way,
the
umbrella
policy’s
property
damage
exclusions
could
be
applicable,
and, 
therefore,
it
is
important
to
understand
the
coverage
implications
presented
by
these
exclusions.
The 
property
damage
exclusions
with
the
most
important
coverage
implications
for
energy
industry
companies 
include
property
in
the
insured’s
care,
custody,
or
control;
damage
to
“your
work”;
and
damage
to 
property
on
which
the
company
is
performing
operations
.
The
impact
of
these
exclusions
is
summarized 
in
Exhibit
9.1.
Most
of
these
exclusions
compare
closely
to
their
CGL
counterparts.
Not
all
umbrellas 
contain
all
of
these
exclusions,
but
most
forms
contain
some
combination
of
these
exclusions.

Alienated
Premises
To
the
extent
this
exclusion
is
applicable
to
oil
and
gas
operations,
it 
is
important
to
ensure
the
alienated
premises
exclusion
does
not 
apply
to
“your
work”
(defined
to
be
the
named
insured’s
completed 
operations
including
work
performed
by
subcontractors)
so
that
the 
exclusion
does
not
apply
if
the
premises
in
question
are
the
named 
insured’s
work
and
were
never
occupied,
rented,
or
held
for
rental
by 
the
named
insured.
This
approach
matches
that
of
the
standard
CGL 
policy’s
alienated
premises
exclusion.
Property
in
the
Insured’s 
Care,
Custody,
or
Control
The
umbrella
policy
may
exclude
coverage
for
nonowned
property
in 
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
the
insured.
Unlike
in
the
CGL
policy, 
some
umbrella
policies
apply
the
exclusion
to
all
property,
as 
opposed
to
just
personal
property.
This
substantially
restricts
the 
insured’s
coverage
with
respect
to
real
property
and
can
result
in 
messy
coverage
disputes
regarding
what
constitutes
“care,
custody, 
or
control”
of
real
property.
Companies
should
attempt
to
have
such 
exclusions
modified
to
match
the
underlying
CGL
policy. 
Furthermore,
the
Oil
Industry
Limitation
Endorsement
may
exclude 
coverage
for
damage
to
equipment
that
is
in
any
insured’s
“care, 
custody,
or
control.”
Therefore,
operators
should
make
sure
to 
secure
adequate
coverage
for
drilling
equipment
and
other
third 
party
property
damage
excluded
by
the
Oil
Industry
Limitation 
Endorsement.
Damage
to
“Your
Product” 
and
“Your
Work”
Like
the
CGL,
umbrella
policies
routinely
exclude
damage
to
the 
company’s
completed
work.
However,
unlike
in
the
CGL
policy, 
many
umbrella
policies
do
not
contain
an
exception
for
damage
to, 
or
arising
out
of,
work
performed
by
subcontractors.
This
represents 
a
significant
loss
of
coverage
for
many
insureds;
therefore,
a 
vigorous
attempt
should
be
made
to
match
the
damage
to
“your 
work”
exclusion
to
that
of
the
underlying
CGL
policy.

additional
insured—
A
person
or

not
automatically
included
as
an
insured
under
an 
insurance
policy,
but
for
which
insured
status
is
arranged,
usually
by
endorsement.
A
named
insured’s 
impetus
for
providing
additional
insured
status
to
others
may
be
a
desire
to
protect
the
other
party
because 
of
a
close
relationship
with
that
party
(e.g.,
employees
or
members
of
an

or
to
comply
with
a 
contractual

to
do
so
(e.g.,

aggregate—
A
limit
in
an
insurance
policy
stipulating
the
most
it
will
pay
for
all
covered
losses
sustained 
during
a
specified
period
of
time,
usually
a

Aggregate
limits
are
commonly
included
in
liability 
policies.
While
not
often
used
in
property
insurance,
aggregates
are
sometimes
included
with
respect
to 
certain
catastrophic
exposures—for
example,
earthquake
and
flood. 
alienated
premises—
Premises
that
have
been
sold
or
given
away
to
another
or
abandoned.
An
exclusion 
in
the
standard
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy
states
that
coverage
does
not
apply
to
property 
damage
(PD)
to
such
premises
arising
out
of
those
premises.
An
exception
to
this
exclusion
clearly
leaves 
coverage
intact
for
insureds’
completed
operations
as
long
as
the
premises
were
never
occupied,
rented, 
or
held
out
for

valve
located
at
the
top
of
a
well
that
may
be
closed
if
the

the
well.
BOPs
are
safety
devices
designed
to
prevent
the
uncontrolled
flow
of 
liquids
and
gasses
during
drilling
operations
and
prevent
a
blowout
from
occurring.
When
the
driller 
closes
the
valve,
a
pressure-tight
seal
is
formed
at
the
top

describing
an
insurance
policy
that
covers
claims
first
made
(reported

that
occur
that
year
or
during
any
previous
period 
during
which
the

Drilling
rigs
can
be
mobile
equipment
mounted
on

drilling
riser—
A
large
pipe
or
conduit
that
provides
a
temporary
extension
of
an
oil
well
to
a
surface 
drilling
facility.
There
are
two
types
of
drilling
risers.
Marine
drilling
risers
are
generally
used
by
floating 
drilling
vessels
and
tie-back
drilling
risers
are
typically
deployed
from
fixed
platforms
or
very
stable 
floating
platforms.
Both
types
of
risers
use
a
blowout
preventer. 
duty
to
defend—
A
term
used
to
describe
an
insurer’s
obligation
to
provide
an
insured
with
defense
to 
claims
made
under
a
liability
insurance
policy.
As
a
general
rule,
an
insured
need
only
establish
that
there 
is
potential
for
coverage
under
a
policy
to
give
rise
to
the
insurer’s
duty
to
defend.
Therefore,
the
duty
to 
defend
may
exist
even
where
coverage
is
in
doubt
and
ultimately
does
not
apply.
Implicit
in
this
rule
is 
the
principle
that
an
insurer’s
duty
to
defend
an
insured
is
broader
than
its
duty
to
indemnify.
Moreover, 
an
insurer
may
owe
a
duty
to
defend
its
insured
against
a
claim
in
which
ultimately
no
damages
are 
awarded,
and
any
doubt
as
to
whether
the
facts
support
a
duty
to
defend
is
usually
resolved
in
the 
insured’s
favor. 
endorsement—
An
addendum
to
an
insurance
policy
that
changes
the
original
policy
provisions. 
Endorsements
may
serve
any
number
of
functions,
including
broadening
the
scope
of
coverage, 
restricting
or
limiting
the
scope
of
coverage,
clarifying
the
application
of
coverage
to
some
unique 
exposure,
adding
other
parties
as
insureds,
or
adding
locations
to
the
policy. 
exclusion—
A

are
injected
rather
than
produced,
the
primary 
purpose
typically
being
to
maintain
reservoir
pressure.
Separated
gas
from
production
wells
or
possibly 
imported
gas
may
be
reinjected
into
the
upper
gas
section
of
the
reservoir.
Water-injection
wells
are 
common
offshore,
where
filtered
and
treated
seawater
is
injected
into

a
mineral
lease.
The
JOA
serves
several
purposes, 
including
identifying
the
property
interests
of
the
parties
in
the
mineral
lease,
designating
the
party
who
is 
to
act
as
operator,
and
setting
forth
the
method
for
sharing
expenses

tank
batteries—
A
group
of
tanks
that
are
connected
to
receive
crude
oil
from
a
well.
In
the
tank
battery, 
the
oil
volume
is
measured
and

system. 
that
particular
part—
A
key
phrase
in
the
property
damage
(PD)
exclusion
of
general
liability
and
some 
umbrella
coverage
forms
that
eliminates
coverage
for
damage
to
work
performed
by
(or
on
behalf
of)
an 
insured
contractor
that
arises
from
that
work.
The
language
precludes
coverage
for
“that
particular
part
of 
real
property”
on
which
the
work
is
performed.
The
intent
is
to
exclude
the
faulty
work
itself
and
yet 
cover
resulting
damage
to
work
already
in
place.
The
phrase
has
been
defined
by
the
courts
as
“a
single 
item
of
property
which,
though
composed
of
many
parts,
is
clearly
a
unit
of
property
within
itself, 
self-contained
and
a
single
item.” 
third-party-over
action—
A
type
of
action
in
which
an
injured
employee,
after
collecting
workers 
compensation
(WC)
benefits
from
the
employer,
sues
a
third
party
for
contributing
to
the
employee’s 
injury.
Then,
because
of
some
type
of
contractual
relationship
between
the
third
party
and
the
employer, 
the
liability
is
passed
back
to
the
employer
by
prior
agreement.
Additionally,
there
are
instances
in
which 
the
third
party
can
circumvent
the
exclusive
remedy
doctrine
of
WC
and
enjoin
the
employer
in
the 
action.
Depending
on
the
nature
and
allegations
of
the
action,
coverage
may
be
afforded
under
the 
contractual
liability
section
of
the
employer’s
commercial
liability
policy
or
the
employers
liability 
section
of
the
employer’s
WC
policy.

umbrella
liability
policy—
A
policy
designed
to
provide
protection
against
catastrophic
losses.
It 
generally
is
written
over
various
primary
liability
policies,
such
as
the
business
auto
policy
(BAP), 
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
policy,

liability
policies,
and

coverage.
The
umbrella
policy
serves
three
purposes:
it
provides
excess
limits
when
the
limits
of
105underlying
liability
policies
are
exhausted
by
the
payment
of
claims;
it
drops
down
and
picks
up
where 
the
underlying
policy
leaves
off
when
the
aggregate
limit
of
the
underlying
policy
in
question
is 
exhausted
by
the
payment
of
claims;
and
it
provides
protection
against
some
claims
not
covered
by
the 
underlying
policies,
subject
to
the
assumption,
by
the
named
insured,
of
a

underground
resources
and
equipment
hazard—
One
of
the
categories
of
hazards
that
is
typically 
excluded
from
coverage
under
general
liability
policies
issued
to
energy
industry
companies.
The
hazard 
is
defined
as
“property
damage”
to:
oil,
gas,
water,
or
other
mineral
resources
not
yet
pumped
or
mined; 
wells,
holes,
formations,
strata,
or
areas
in

which
exploration
or

is
carried
on;
and

above
or
beneath
the
surface
of
any
body
of
water. 
Coverage
for
this
hazard
can
accomplished
by
attaching

underlying
coverage—
With
respect
to
any
given
policy
of
excess
insurance,
the
coverage
in
place
on
the 
same
risk
that
will
respond
to
loss
before
the
excess

is
called
on
to
pay
any
portion
of
the
claim.
waiver
of
subrogation—
An
agreement
between
two
parties
in
which
one
party
agrees
to
waive 
subrogation
rights
against
another
in
the
event
of
a
loss.
The
intent
of
the
waiver
is
to
prevent
one
party's 
insurer
from
pursuing
subrogation
against
the
other
party.
Generally,
insurance
policies
do
not
bar 
coverage
if
an
insured
waives
subrogation
against
a
third
party
before
a
loss.
However,
coverage
is 
excluded
from
many
policies
if
subrogation
is
waived
after
a
loss
because
to
do
so
would
violate
the 
principle
of
indemnity.

The
process
of

and
other
fluid
from
the
wellbore
in
an

on
its
own.
Swabbing
is
necessary
when
