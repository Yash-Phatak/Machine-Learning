This
course
has
two
major
objectives. 
The
first
objective
of
the
course
is
to
provide
an
overview
of
the
kinds
of
situations
that
can
give
rise
to 
both
property
and
liability
losses
when
a
business
engages
in
various
cyber
activities.
More
specifically, 
companies
that
use
email,
operate
a
website,
take
orders
online
(and
collect
customer
data
in
the
process), 
participate
in
social
media
activities,
or
engage
the
services
of
a
cloud
provider
(just
to
name
a
few 
examples)
are
exposed
to
significant
potential
first-party
property
and
third-party
liability
claims.
The 
first
half
of
the
course—Chapters
2
through
12—examines
these
exposures
in
depth. 
The
second
objective
of
this
course
is
to
offer
a
detailed
look
at
the
kinds
of
policy
forms
that
have
been 
designed
to
cover
these
exposures.
Thus,
the
second
half
of
the
course—Chapters
8
through
13—begins 
by
analyzing
the
policies’
insuring
agreements
and
continues
by
discussing
other
key
provisions,
such
as 
insured
persons,
insured
organizations,
defense/settlement,
coverage
limits,
and
retentions.
This
second 
section
of
the
course
concludes
by
examining
the
most
common
exclusions
found
within
cyber
and 
privacy
policy
forms,
focusing
on
the
manner
in
which
such
wordings
vary
from
insurer-to-insurer,
and 
explaining
how
these
variations
exert
significant
impact
on
the
scope
of
coverage
that
cyber
and
privacy 
policies
provide. 
A
Glossary
following
the
final
chapter
defines
key
terms
and
concepts
used
in
this
course.

dependent
business
interruption,
(3)
extra
expense,
(4)
data
asset

many
of
the
property
and
liability 
exposures
noted
above.
•
Identify
various
loss
control
measures
that
can
be
applied
to
eliminate,
or
at

business
can
be
financially
impacted
by
these
loss
exposures.
•
Recognize
how
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
rated
by
insurers
and
identify
the
key
factors
that 
underwriters
consider
in

the
coverage.
1•
Recognize
the
effect
of
the
key
first-party
property
and
third-party
liability
insuring
agreements 
found
within
the
policies.
•

how
the
following
types
of
provisions
operate
within

the
most
important
exclusions
found
within
cyber

privacy
forms,
recognize
how 
different
insurers’
versions
of
these
same
exclusions
vary,
and
recognize
how
such
differences 
impact
the
scope
of
coverage
the
policies
provide.

Demystifying
Cyber
and
Privacy
Loss 
Exposures
and
Insurance
Coverage
Overview
The
purpose
of
this
chapter
is
to
introduce
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
coverage
and
to
clarify
an
often 
confusing
coverage.
In
light
of
the
fact
that
what
we
may
call
“traditional”
insurance
(e.g.,
general 
liability,
property,
and
so
on)
continues
to
distance
itself
from
offering
coverage
for
cyber-related 
exposures,
it
is
all
the
more
important
for
purchasers
and
providers
of
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
to 
understand
its
nuances
and
distinctions
from
so-called
traditional
insurance. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Recognize
various
names
by
which
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
referred
to.
•
Differentiate
between
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
and
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O) 
insurance.
•
Identify
the
basic
types
of
property
and
liability
exposures
covered
by
cyber
and
privacy
insurance 
policies.
•
Recognize
the
decisions
that
purchasers
of
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
must
make
when 
selecting
insuring
agreements,
limits,
and
retentions.
•
Recognize
some
of
the
important
overlaps
in
coverage
between
cyber
and
privacy
policies
and
the 
following
types
of
insurance:
commercial
general
liability
(CGL),
property
insurance,
and
media 
liability
insurance.
•
Identify
several
unusual
coverage
elements
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies.
3Confusing
Aspects
of
Cyber
and
Privacy
Insurance
Virtually
no
organizations
are
immune
to
the
risks
associated
with
the
Internet
and
electronic
commerce. 
Nearly
all
businesses—regardless
of
industry
or
size—now,
at
a
minimum,
have
access
to
the
Internet, 
operate
an
internal
email
system,
and
maintain
their
own
websites.
In
addition,
a
vast
amount
of 
businesses
are
also
in
a
position
to
solicit
and
process
orders
for
their
products
using
“e-commerce.” 
Moreover,
such
firms
are
also
engaging
in
social
media
and
cloud
computing.
In
combination,
these 
diverse
types
of
cyber
activities
give
rise
to
a
variety
of
liability
and
property
loss
exposures,
along
with 
the
need
for
insurance
policies
that
cover
these
exposures. 
There
are
at
least
10
reasons
why
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
considered
one
of
the
more
confusing,
if 
not
outright
mystifying,
lines
of
coverage
available
in
today’s
market.

Confusing
Aspects
of
Cyber
and
Privacy
Insurance
Coverage
•
The
coverage
is
referred
to
by
various
names.
•
It
is
often
confused
with
technology
E&O
coverage.
•
Both
cyber
and
privacy
and
technology
E&O
policies
cover
many
of
the
same
risks.
•
Both
property
and
liability
exposures
are
covered
under
cyber
and
privacy
insurance.
•
The
nature
of
the
coverage
varies
considerably
from
insurer
to
insurer.
•
The
menu-driven
nature
of
the
policies
creates
special
problems.
•
The
cyber
and
privacy
exposure
is
rapidly
evolving.
•
Cyber
and
privacy
policies
are
also
rapidly
evolving.
•
Cyber
and
privacy
coverage
aspects
overlap
with
commercial

Any
time
a
line
of
insurance
is
referred
to
by
a
wide
variety
of
names
or
terms,
it
is
an
invitation
to 
misunderstanding.
More
specifically,
here
are
some
examples
of
the
titles
of
various
cyber
and
privacy 
policies
offered
by
a
number
of
leading
insurers.
Furthermore,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
one
insurance 
company
to
have
numerous
cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms,
each
named
differently.

For
the
purposes
of
this
course,
we
will
use
the
term
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
to
discuss
and
analyze 
the
various
policies
that
cover
the
aforementioned
types
of
exposures. 
6Confusion
with
Technology
E&O
Coverage
Cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
often
confused
with
technology
E&O
insurance
coverage.
Although
the 
terms
“cyber
and
privacy
insurance”
and
“technology
errors
and
omissions
insurance”
are
sometimes 
used
interchangeably,
there
is
indeed
a
clear
distinction
between
the
types
of
risks
that
each
of
these
two 
types
of
policies
seeks
to
address. 
In
a
nutshell,
technology
E&O
coverage
is
intended
to
cover
providers
of
technology
services
and 
products.
In
contrast,
cyber
and
privacy
coverage
is
intended
for
users
of
technology
services
and 
products,
encompassing
a
much
broader
range
of
business
types. 
Technology
E&O:
Coverage
for
Providers
of
Technology
Services
and
Products
Two
types
of
businesses
require
technology
E&O
insurance—providers
of
technology
services
and 
providers
of
technology
products. 
Providers
of
Technology
Services
Data
storage
companies
that
store
customer
data
on
an
offsite
basis
and
businesses
that
offer
website 
design,
maintenance,
and
hosting
services
for
a
fee
are
examples
of
firms
that
are
in
the
business
of 
providing
technology
services
.
For
example,
companies
like
this
could
face
(and
have
faced)
errors
and 
omissions
liability
for
failing
to
properly
secure
a
website
that
they
design,
ultimately
leading
to
the
site 
being
compromised. 
Providers
of
Technology
Products
Computer
software
manufacturers
(such
as
those
that
write
various
types
of
applications
and
programs) 
and
computer
manufacturers
(that
actually
make
computer
hardware)
are
examples
of
companies
that 
provide
technology
products.
Manufacturing
insecure
or
faulty
products
could
lead
to
errors
and 
omissions
liability
for
these
technology
companies. 
Cyber
and
Privacy
Coverage:
Coverage
for
Users
of
Technology
Services
and
Products
Conversely,
firms
that
use
technology
products
and
services
in
their
business
require
cyber
and
privacy 
coverage.
Although
such
services
and
products
are
an
integral
part
of
their
businesses,
they
do
not
make 
money
selling
those
services
or
products
to
customers.
Rather,
they
merely
use
technology
products
to
do 
so. 
Examples
Banks
are
obvious
users
(although
they
can
certainly
also
be
providers
in
various
ways)
of
technology 
services
since
the
vast
majority
of
transactions
are
recorded
electronically.
Similarly,
any
company
that 
takes
orders
over
the
Internet
must
avail
itself
of
technology
services
and
products.
Healthcare
institutions 
and
law
firms
also
regularly
use
electronic
records
to
track
sensitive
and
critical
patient
and
client
7information.
Lastly,
publishing
companies
that
provide
online
content
are
also
users
of
technology 
services
and
products. 
These
are
just
a
few
examples
of
exposures
applicable
to
cyber
and
privacy
coverage.
In
reality, 
essentially
every
type
of
organization
faces
this
risk
now. 
Both
Cyber
and
Privacy
Policies
and
Technology
E&O
Policies
Cover
Many
of
the 
Same
Risks
Adding
to
the
confusion
between
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
and
technology
E&O
insurance
is
that
both 
types
of
policies
may
cover
many
of
the
same
exposures.
Specifically,
both
cyber
and
privacy
and 
technology
E&O
policies
may
have
some
degree
of
coverage
for
liability
arising
out
of
a
breach
of 
customer
data
(also
known
as
personally
identifiable
information,
or
“PII”). 
Coverage
of
Property
and
Liability
Exposures
under
the
Same
Policy
Form
Adding
to
the
enigmatic
nature
of
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
the
fact
that
some
policies
cover
both 
property
and
liability
exposures.
In
contrast,
commercial
insurance
policies
almost
always
cover
either 
property
or
liability
exposures,
but
generally
not
both.
(Businessowners
policies,
which
cover
both,
are 
one
of
the
few
exceptions.) 
Therefore,
unlike
nearly
every
other
type
of
professional
and
E&O
policy
form,
cyber
and
privacy 
policies
also
may
include
coverage
of
items
such
as
business
interruption,
loss
of
data,
and
loss
of
money, 
as
well
as
tangible
property—areas
addressed
under
property
insurance
forms. 
8Lack
of
Coverage
Standardization—Especially
as
to
Property
Coverage
Although
most
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
provide
at
least
some
level
of
property
insurance 
(business
interruption,
extra
expense,
dependent
business
interruption),
the
forms
vary
considerably
as
to 
the
actual
extent
of
property
coverage
they
provide. 
On
one
hand,
some
insurers
philosophically
view
cyber
and
privacy
coverage
as
essentially
a
type
of 
liability
insurance.
Accordingly,
such
insurers
offer
only
a
relatively
bare-bones
package
of
property 
coverage—and
some
do
so
only
by
means
of
an
endorsement
(rather
than
including
property
coverage
in 
their
standard
form). 
At
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
other
insurers
afford
a
more
comprehensive
cyber
and
privacy
policy 
that
includes
a
robust
set
of
property
coverages,
like
business
interruption
and
extra
expense. 
Menu-Driven
Nature
of
the
Coverage
Unlike
most
types
of
professional/E&O
policy
forms,
cyber
and
privacy
policies
contain
as
many
as
10 
separate
insuring
agreements—a
fact
that,
in
some
instances,
requires
the
insured
to
select
up
to
10 
separate
individual
coverage
limits,
as
well
as
10
individual
deductible
amounts
(i.e.,
one
for
each
type
of 
coverage
selected). 
Yet
Another
Problem:
The
Policy
Aggregate
Limit
As
if
choosing
10
separate
coverage
limits
and
deductibles
weren’t
an
already
challenging
task,
the 
policies
are
also
written
with
an
annual
aggregate
limit
that
applies
across
all
coverages
the
insured
has 
selected—a
fact
that
creates
the
need
for
the
insured
to
make
yet
another
limit-related
decision. 
Emerging
Nature
of
the
Exposure
The
cyber
and
privacy
exposure
has
evolved
much
more
rapidly
in
more
recent
years
than,
for
example, 
the
liability
exposures
facing
fiduciaries,
insurance
professionals,
or
real
estate
agents.
Cloud
computing, 
social
media,
evolving
forms
of
cyber
attacks,
and
shifting
regulatory
environments
are
just
a
few
of
the 
factors
that
impact
the
rapid
evolution
of
cyber
exposures. 
Not
only
is
the
exposure
evolving
in
type
and
frequency,
but
the
average
cost
of
resolving
data
breaches 
has
become
more
costly
over
the
years. 
Emerging
Nature
of
the
Coverage
Just
as
the
cyber
and
privacy
exposure
has
advanced
at
breakneck
pace,
so
too
has
the
nature
of
the
policy 
forms
written
to
address
the
exposure.
Consider
that
in
years
past,
the
vast
majority
of
policies
focused
on 
providing
coverage
for
liability
arising
out
of
a
data
breach
but
not
on
affording
coverage
for
data
breach 
response
costs
(e.g.,
notification,
credit
monitoring,
public
relations
expenses)
to
the
extent
that
the
more 
recent
policies
do. 
Overlap
with
CGL,
Professional
Liability,
and
Property
Insurance
Policies
Another
confusing
aspect
of
cyber
and
privacy
policies
is
that
some
coverage
for
several
of
the
same 
exposures
provided
by
cyber
and
privacy
forms
is
also
made
available
under
CGL,
management
liability, 
and
property
insurance
policy
forms. 
CGL
Coverage
Overlaps
Occasionally,
there
may
be
coverage
for
advertising
injury
liability
under
both
the
CGL
and
the
content 
liability
coverage
section
offered
under
cyber
and
privacy
liability
policies.
However,
it
should
be 
recognized
that
CGL
advertising
injury
liability
does
not
apply
to
(1)
media
firms
and
(2)
advertising
of
9any
but
an
insured’s
own
products. 
Management
Liability
Coverage
Overlaps
A
number
of
management
liability
policies
cover
some
of
the
exposures
addressed
by
cyber
and
privacy 
forms,
albeit
on
a
restrictive,
sublimited,
and
third-party-only
basis.
Case-in-point:
most
(although
not
all) 
employment
practices
liability
insurance
(EPLI)
policies
cover
claims
alleging
breach
of
privacy,
such
as 
when
an
employee’s
personnel
file
is
accessed
by
unauthorized
persons
within
the
insured
company. 
Although
these
forms
likely
intend
to
cover
physical,
in-person
“breaches,”
evolving
methods
of
cyber 
breaches
may
blur
the
line
between
what
is
an
EPLI
exposure
and
what
is
strictly
a
cyber
and
privacy 
exposure.
Furthermore,
a
“breach”
in
this
case
would
likely
need
to
come
from
an
employee
(rather
than 
an
outside
actor)
in
order
for
coverage
to
apply. 
Property
Insurance
Coverage
Overlaps
Property
insurance
policies
vary
widely
as
to
the
nature
of
coverage
they
afford
when
an
insured
suffers
a 
loss
involving
electronic
data
and
the
systems
used
to
process
such
data.
For
example,
the
broadest 
property
insurers’
forms
will
cover
business
interruption
loss
due
to
a
company’s
e-commerce
system 
being
rendered
inoperable
as
the
result
of
a
cyber
incident.
In
contrast,
other
property
insurers’
forms 
require
actual
physical
damage
to
these
systems
(such
as
from
fire,
vandalism,
windstorm,
or
flood)
as
a 
condition
precedent
to
providing
coverage. 
Miscellaneous
Idiosyncratic
Coverage
Provisions
Lastly,
a
number
of
coverage
provisions
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies
are
unique
to
this 
particular
area
of
insurance.
Following
are
three
notable
examples. 
Fines
and
Penalties
Cyber
and
privacy
policies
almost
universally
cover
fines
and
penalties.
As
an
example,
coverage
is
often 
provided
when
a
state
or
local
authority
levies
a
fine
or
penalty
against
an
insured
for
failing
to
prevent
a 
breach
of
customer
data
or
for
failing
to
notify
the
customer
that
such
a
breach
has
occurred.
This 
approach
represents
a
distinct
departure
from
other
lines
of
professional/E&O
insurance,
which
almost 
universally
exclude
coverage
for
fines
and
penalties. 
Content
Liability
Another
example
of
an
idiosyncratic
coverage
approach
(albeit
more
specifically
related
to
media
firms) 
is
that
some
insurers
will
not
cover
a
media
firm’s
content
risks
under
a
cyber
and
privacy
form.
Their 
philosophy
is
that
such
businesses
require
more
robust—and
thus
separate—policies
to
cover
more 
significant
content
risks
such
as
plagiarism,
copyright
infringement,
defamation,
and
trademark 
violations,
to
which
media
firms
like
publishers,
advertising
agencies,
and
radio
and
television 
broadcasters
are
subject.
It
should
be
noted
that
as
more
and
more
companies
delve
deeper
into
online 
publishing
(e.g.,
detailed
social
media
posts
and/or
professional-level
blog
posts),
this
coverage
nuance
is 
becoming
all
the
more
applicable
to
a
broader
range
of
companies
offering
different
products
and 
services. 
Dual
Coverage
Triggers
Since
both
liability
and
property
exposures
are
often
times
addressed
by
cyber
and
privacy
policies,
the 
forms
are
often
written
with
two
different
types
of
coverage
triggers—claims-made
triggers
applying
to 
the
liability
insuring
agreements
and
occurrence
triggers
(possibly
including
time
element
deductibles)
to 
the
property
sections.
As
a
consequence,
various
foreseeable
complications
can
result
in
the
event
that
a 
single
loss
involves
both
liability
and
property
insuring
agreements
and,
therefore,
claims-made
and 
occurrence
coverage
triggers. 
Summary
Cyber
and
privacy
insurance
coverage
can
be
confusing

a
number
of
reasons,
including
the
following.

to
which
businesses
are

when 
they
engage
in

activities.

This

addresses
the
nature
of
information

exposures,
which
refer
to
the
liabilities 
that
result
from
breaches
of
an
electronic
network. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Identify
three
types
of
information
security
liability
exposures.
•
Recognize
the
loss
exposures
existing
in
a
given
scenario.
12What
Is
Information
Security
Liability?
Information
security
liability
refers
to
the
liabilities
that
result
from
sensitive
information
being
exposed 
after
(or
during)
breaches
of
an
electronic
network. 
A
network
breach
occurs
when
someone 
•
gains
access
to
a
computer
network
despite
not
being
authorized
to
do
so,
•
transmits
malicious
code
(e.g.,
a
virus)
or
otherwise
attacks
a
computer
network,
or
•
prevents
a
third
party
who
is
authorized
to
do
so
from
gaining
access
to
a
computer
network
(i.e.,
a 
denial
of
service
attack).
“Computer
network,”
as
used
in
the
points
above,
should
be
understood
to
include
not
only
servers
and 
Web
applications
regularly
accessed
by
desktop
and
mobile
device
users
but
also
credit
card
processors, 
mobile
apps,
and
other
devices
connected
to
the
Internet
in
some
capacity
(commonly
referred
to
as
“The 
Internet
of
Things”). 
The
following
scenario,
which
involves
a
hospital,
illustrates
the
various
types
of
liability
that
each
of 
these
three
kinds
of
network
breaches
can
produce.
Hospitals
are
an
excellent
example
to
examine
from
a 
cyber
and
privacy
liability
perspective
due
to
the
sensitive,
private
information
they
store
as
well
as
the 
serious
harm
that
can
be
done
if
this
information
is
not
readily
accessible
during
and
after
a
breach. 
Liability
for
Failure
To
Prevent
Unauthorized
Access
to
a
Computer
System
Assume
that
a
hacker
gains
access
to
a
hospital’s
database
that
contains
the
personal
health
records
of
the 
200,000
patients
it
has
treated
during
the
past
decade.
As
a
result
of
this
unauthorized
intrusion
into
its 
computer
system,
the
hospital
has
incurred
what
is
known
as
privacy
liability,
a
type
of
liability
that
will 
be
discussed
in
more
detail
within
the
pages
that
follow.
This
liability
could
be
especially
applicable
in 
the
event
that
a
company
failed
to
adequately
encrypt
its
data
or
take
other
security
measures
a
company 
in
its
position
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
take. 
It
should
not
be
assumed
that
a
hacker
like
the
one
alluded
to
above
is
an
individual
or
group
that
has
no 
previous
affiliation
with
the
affected
organization
itself.
Exposure
from
frustrated
employees
that
feel
like 
they
have
been
wronged
by
the
organization
can
also
be
significant.
This
is
especially
true
given
the
fact 
that
these
employees
may
already
possess
the
credentials
or
security
clearance
necessary
to
breach
a 
network,
which
an
outsider
may
have
greater
difficulty
obtaining. 
Liability
for
Transmission
of
Malicious
Code
In
the
scenario
above,
assume
that
the
hacker
has
also
found
a
way
to
infect
the
hospital’s
database
with
a 
virus
that
renders
some
of
its
patients’
health
records
unusable.
More
specifically,
malicious
code
means 
any
virus,
Trojan
horse,
malware,
worm,
or
any
other
similar
software
program,
code,
or
script 
intentionally
designed
to
insert
itself
into
computer
memory
or
onto
a
computer
disk
and
spread
itself 
from
one
computer
or
network
to
another.
This
transmission
could
very
likely
have
the
effect
of 
compromising
the
quality
of
care
delivered
by
the
hospital,
which
could
potentially
give
rise
to
liability 
claims
against
it. 
13Computer
Virus
Deletes
Files:
A
Non-Hospital
Claim
Scenario
Customers
and
suppliers
routinely
communicate
via
email,
and
it
is
becoming
more
common
to
even 
allow
customers
access
to
company
intranets
(i.e.,
a
company’s
internal
Internet
system).
Computer 
viruses
can
be
spread
from
the
supplier
to
the
customer,
resulting
in
the
deletion
of
files
in
the
customers’ 
systems.
Such
an
event
can
cause
a
customer
to
incur
substantial
costs
in
repairing
its
purchasing
system 
as
well
as
lost
revenue
from
its
inability
to
purchase
raw
material
in
a
timely
fashion
to
meet
delivery 
requirements.
The
customer
may
sue
the
supplier
for
the
expenses
of
repairing
the
damage
caused
by
the 
virus
as
well
as
for
lost
revenue.
Viruses
can
enter
computer
systems
through
a
variety
of
means. 
Nevertheless,
the
supplier
may
still
be
found
liable
to
the
customer
for
the
damage
caused
by
the
virus 
from
the
supplier’s
system. 
Liability
for
Preventing
an
Authorized
Third
Party
from
Gaining
Access
to
a 
Computer
System:
Denial
of
Service
Attacks
Continuing
with
this
hospital
claim
scenario
(above),
also
assume
that
a
number
of
physicians
working 
outside
of
the
hospital
are
authorized
to
access
the
hospital’s
computer
system.
Such
access
facilitates 
treatment
of
former
hospital
patients
who
are
now
being
treated
at
the
individual
physicians’
offices. 
However,
as
a
result
of
the
hacking,
these
physicians
are
unable
to
access
their
patients’
records,
a 
situation
that
compromises
the
quality
of
the
patients’
care
and
ultimately
generates
liability
for
the 
physicians
when
this
occurs.
The
physicians,
in
turn,
could
then
sue
the
hospital,
based
on
the
hospital’s 
negligence
in
not
preventing
the
initial
breach
of
its
computer
system. 
Liability
for
Network
Breaches
Affects
All
Industries
This
hospital
scenario
notwithstanding,
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
types
of
liability
incurred 
above
are
in
no
sense
limited
to
the
healthcare
industry.
For
example,
as
a
result
of
a
network
breach,
a 
credit
card
processing
company
would
incur
liability
if
a
hacker
gained
access
to
the
personal
data 
belonging
to
its
cardholders.
A
clothing
retailer
that
operates
an
online
order
system
would
incur
liability 
if
that
same
hacker
transmitted
a
virus
to
its
computer
network
and
the
virus
infected
the
computer 
systems
or
stole
the
personal
information
of
all
of
its
customers
who
placed
orders
on
the
clothing 
retailer’s
network.
Lastly,
a
company
operating
a
website
offering
a
subscription
service
that
provided 
stock
market
data
could
be
held
liable
if
the
hacker
also
found
a
way
to
block
access
to
the
website
when 
the
company’s
subscribers
attempted
to
log
on. 
Summary
Information
security
liability
results
from
the
breach
of
a
computer
network
and
occurs
when
(1)
an 
unauthorized
person
gains
access
to
that
network,
(2)
an
unauthorized
person
injects
or
transmits
a
virus 
or
other
kind
of
malicious
code
into
the
network,
or
(3)
an
unauthorized
breach
prevents
an
authorized 
third
party
from
gaining
access
to
the
network.

Privacy
Liability
Exposures
Overview
Privacy
liability
is
incurred
by
a
company
when
its
computer
system
is
breached
by
a
hacker
or
other
bad 
actor
and,
as
a
consequence,
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
is
obtained
and/or
released
to 
unauthorized
persons. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Recognize
instances
of
privacy
liability.
•
Recognize
the
meaning
of
the
all-important
term
PII.
•
Recognize
the
special
privacy
exposures
of
healthcare
companies.
•
Identify
various
laws
relating
to
privacy
liability.
•
Identify
the
frequency,
costs,
and
causes
of
privacy
breaches.
15What
Is
Privacy
Liability?
Privacy
liability,
defined
above,
is
closely
tied
in
with
PII. 
16Exhibit
3.1
 
What
Is
Personally
Identifiable
Information
(PII)?
PII
is
information
that
can
be
used
to
uniquely
identify,
contact,
or
locate
a
single
person
or
can
be 
used
in
conjunction
with
other
sources
to
uniquely
identify
a
single
individual.
The
following
data,
often
used
for
the
express
purpose
of
distinguishing
individual
identity,
are 
typically
considered
PII.
•
Full
name
(if
not
common)
•
National
identification
number
(i.e.,
Social
Security
number)
•
Internet

Privacy
Breaches
Are
Not
Always
Electronic
It
is
critical
to
note
that
privacy
breaches
are
not
confined
to
breaches
of
computer
networks
or
electronic 
systems.
Small
businesses
are
especially
vulnerable
to
privacy
breaches
that
occur
by
nonelectronic 
means. 
Specifically,
privacy
breaches
can
occur
from
loss,
theft,
improper
disposal
of,
or
misplacement
of
the 
following. 
•
Laptop/notebook
computers
•
Paper
files
•
Customer
lists
•
Human
resources
records
•
Mobile
phones
and
tablets
•
Flash
drives
According
to
one
security
survey,
about
15
percent
of
breaches
are
due
to
lost
or
stolen
devices.
1
Even 
today,
there
are
still
a
frightening
number
of
incidents
in
which
security
personnel
responsible
for 
valuable,
high-risk
operations
(for
example,
those
working
at
nuclear
power
plants)
have
had
mobile 
phones
or
identity
cards
compromised.
Clearly,
despite
the
electronic
origins
of
many
privacy
breaches, 
the
simple
threat
of
lost
or
stolen
devices
is
still
a
significant
exposure,
even
in
high-value/risk
areas
such 
as
these
examples. 
17Types
of
Costs
Incurred
in
Responding
to
a
Privacy
Breach
Consider
the
following
hospital
privacy
breach
scenario.
A
hacker
breaches
the
computer
system
of
a 
major
hospital
and,
in
the
process,
obtains
the
complete
health
records
of
50,000
patients.
The
hospital 
must
expend
a
total
of
$15
million
to
respond
to
this
breach. 
Among
the
costs
incurred
by
the
hospital,
which
now
faces
a
multitude
of
privacy
liability
claims
from 
patients
whose
records
have
been
exposed,
are
the
following. 
•
Set
up
a
call
center
following
the
breach.
•
Notify
each
of
the
patients
affected.
•
Monitor
the
credit
of
the
affected
patients
(usually
for
1
year).
•
Incur
identity
theft
insurance
costs
for
the
affected
patients.
•
Pay
the
costs
required
to
restore
stolen
identities
resulting
from
the
breach.
•
Pay
actual
losses
sustained
from
the
theft
of
the
patients’
identities
(e.g.,
the
loss
resulting
when
a 
thief
gains
access
to
and
withdraws
the
proceeds
of
a
victim’s
entire
stock
brokerage
account).
•
Hire
a
computer
security/forensics
company
to
investigate
the
source
of
the
breach
and
recommend 
measures
to
prevent
further
disclosures
of
records
from
similar
vulnerabilities.
•
Engage
the
services
of
a
public
relations
firm.
•
Defend
a
class
action
suit
brought
against
the
hospital
by
patients
whose
records
were 
compromised.
•
Pay
various
fines
levied
by
regulators.
•
Hire
a
so-called
breach
coach,
typically
an
attorney,
who
will
walk
the
insured
through
the
entire 
process
of
responding
to
the
situation,
including
many
of
the
steps
above.
18The
Special
Privacy
Exposures
of
Healthcare-Related
Companies
The
healthcare
and
social
assistance
industry
is
routinely
considered
the
largest
single-industry
employer 
in
the
country.
Because
they
frequently
handle
sensitive
patient
financial
and
health
information,
hospitals 
are
data-rich
targets
for
hackers.
This
is
especially
true
with
the
continual
increase
in
the
use
of
electronic 
medical
records
(EMRs),
which
are
electronic
versions
of
a
patient’s
detailed
medical
history. 
As
required
by
the
American
Recovery
and
Reinvestment
Act
of
2009,
also
known
as
the
Health 
Information
Technology
for
Economic
and
Clinical
Health
Act
(the
HITECH
Act),
the
Office
of
Civil 
Rights’
website
posts
a
list
of
the
covered
entities
that
have
reported
breaches
of
unsecured
protected 
health
information
affecting
more
than
500
individuals. 
On
March
12,
2012,
the
Office
of
Civil
Rights
reached
its
first
settlement
under
the
HITECH
Act,
settling 
with
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
of
Tennessee
for
$1.5
million
due
to
a
data
breach
occurring
in
2009.
In
this 
case,
57
unencrypted
hard
drives
were
stolen
from
a
closet
in
a
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
facility.
On
these 
hard
drives
were
the
medical
records
of
approximately
1
million
patients.
On
top
of
the
$1.5
million 
settlement,
it
was
estimated
that
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
spent
$17
million
in
additional
costs
responding 
to
the
breach.
2 
Other
Office
of
Civil
Rights
settlements
include
the
following.

•
Premera
Blue
Cross:
$6.85
million
settlement,
September
25,
2020.
Hackers
used
a
phishing 
email
to
install
malware
and
obtain
information
of
10.4
million
individuals.
•
CHSPSC
LLC:
$2.3
million
settlement
and
corrective
action
plan,
September
23,
2020. 
Hackers
gained
access
using
compromised
administrative
credentials
and
obtained
information
of 
over
6
million
individuals.
•
Athens
Orthopedic
Clinic,
PA:
$1.5
million
settlement,
September
21,
2020.
Hackers
used
a 
vendor’s
credentials
to
obtain
patient
records
for
200,000
individuals.
Privacy
Loss
Scenarios
Now
consider
the
following
privacy
claim
scenario
not
involving
a
hospital.
A
company
sets
up
and 
operates
a
website
for
the
online
trading
of
securities.
To
trade
using
the
site,
customers
must
supply 
personal
and
financial
information
to
the
company,
and
they
are
assured
the
information
will
be
secure. 
However,
a
glitch
in
the
encryption
software
allows
unauthorized
persons
to
access
information 
transmitted
to
and
from
the
site.
Customers
may
sue
the
Web
services
provider
for
any
losses
incurred
as 
a
result
of
the
glitch
that
permitted
others
to
access
their
confidential
information.
At
a
minimum,
such 
losses
may
include
the
costs
of
changing
accounts
and
account
numbers
at
banks
and
brokerage
firms
and 
might
even
include
lost
investment
income
during
the
changeover
periods. 
The
following
real-world
loss
scenario
illustrates
a
privacy
claim
not
involving
a
computer
network.
4
A
19vehicle
being
used
by
an
employee
of
CBR
Systems,
a
stem
cell
storage
company,
was
broken
into. 
Included
in
the
stolen
items
was
a
backpack
containing
a
laptop
and
other
portable
devices.
These
devices 
contained
unencrypted
PII,
including
names,
addresses,
Social
Security
numbers,
medical
histories,
and 
payment
details
for
approximately
300,000
clients
of
CBR.
Although
no
computer
network
was
breached 
per
se,
CBR
was
still
penalized
with
a
20-year
consent
order
from
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
(FTC), 
requiring
the
company
to
maintain
information
security
programs,
allowing
an
independent
auditor
to 
monitor
their
operations,
and
reporting
back
to
the
FTC
on
a
periodic
basis.
Furthermore,
the
company 
was
forced
to
settle
a
class
action
lawsuit
brought
by
its
clients,
resulting
in
a
total
settlement
amount
of 
about
$112
million,
including
identity
theft-related
losses,
credit
monitoring,
and
attorneys’
fees. 
20Privacy
Liability
Laws
The
liability
incurred
by
the
hospital
in
the
scenario
noted
above
results
from
a
patchwork
of
privacy
laws 
that
have
been
enacted
in
various
states.
Such
laws
indicate
that
responsibility
for
a
breach
lies
with
the 
company
or
business
that
collected
and
stored
the
affected
data.
Additionally,
attorneys
general
in
the 
various
states
have
broad
enforcement
powers
(similar
to
the
FTC).
Under
such
laws,
they
have
the
power 
to
investigate
breaches
and
file
lawsuits
against
the
offending
companies,
levy
fines/penalties,
and 
enforce
federal
laws
against
the
company
responsible
for
the
breach
(such
as
the
Health
Insurance 
Portability
and
Accountability
Act,
known
as
HIPAA). 
Lack
of
an
Overriding
Federal
Law
for
Privacy
Breaches
Importantly,
there
is
no
overarching
US
federal
law
that
sets
standards
mandating
either
(1)
specific
data 
protection
requirements
or
(2)
definitive
loss
notification
benchmarks
to
regulators
or
to
individuals 
affected
by
a
breach.
Rather,
as
noted
above,
the
individual
state
laws,
as
well
as
federal
law
and 
consumer
privacy
laws
that
are
industry-based,
often
apply
simultaneously
and
may
contradict
one 
another
in
some
cases. 
The
Varying
Nature
of
State
Breach
Notification
Laws
All
states
in
the
United
States
of
America
have
enacted
some
form
of
legislation
requiring
notification
of 
breaches
or
potential
breaches
of
PII
for
private,
governmental,
or
educational
entities.
Unfortunately, 
each
state
varies
in
exactly
what
is
required,
and
this
hodgepodge
system
of
regulations
makes
it
difficult 
for
most
businesses
to
comply
with
this
maze
of
laws,
particularly
for
those
that
do
business
in
multiple 
states. 
Which
State’s
Law
Applies
in
the
Event
of
a
Breach?
The
specific
state
law
that
applies
to
any
given
breach
is
typically
based
on
two
factors:
(1)
the 
consumer’s
state
of
residence,
and
(2)
the
state
in
which
the
business
is
incorporated.
Compliance, 
especially
for
firms
in
highly
regulated
industries
such
as
health
care,
legal,
educational,
and
financial 
services,
is
therefore
no
easy
task. 
How,
Whom,
and
When
To
Notify:
The
“Safe
Harbor”
Owing
to
the
inherently
confusing
nature
of
the
compliance
process,
the
data
breach
notification
laws 
applicable
in
many
states
provide
a
“safe
harbor,”
which
requires
companies
to
notify
only
when
sensitive 
information
was
exposed
in
unencrypted
form
or
if
the
information
was
misused,
despite
encryption. 
States
laws
vary
as
to
how
,
whom
,
and
when
to
notify.
Some
states
may
require
information
security 
action
plans
following
a
breach;
enforce
fines
in
the
thousands
of
dollars
per
individual
violation;
require 
regular
monitoring
and
reviews;
have
overly
broad
definitions
of
“affected
individuals,”
thereby 
broadening
the
scope
of
notification
requirements;
and/or
have
specific
data
disposal
laws
that
go
along 
with
notification
requirements. 
Companies
should
be
in
consultation
with
cyber
and
privacy
legal
experts
in
order
to
fully
understand 
their
notification
obligations
from
state
to
state
in
the
event
of
a
major
breach.
Until
a
federal
law
is
21enacted
to
set
consistent
cyber-related
enforcement
expectations,
companies
will
be
faced
with
this 
ongoing
challenge
of
navigating
a
patchwork
legal
environment. 
22Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
(SEC)
Breach
Notification
Requirements
The
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
(SEC)
has
issued
guidance
that
encourages
companies
to 
disclose
privacy
breaches
in
an
effective
manner.
5
The
guidance
was
aimed
at
instructing
businesses
on 
what
it
terms
a
“material
cyber
attack,”
notice
of
which
should
be
included
within
the
SEC’s
already 
required
annual/quarterly
disclosures
and
filings. 
Under
the
SEC
guidance,
the
following
information
should
be
included
within
a
disclosure. 
•
Remediation
costs
that
were
incurred,
which
include
the
costs
of
credit
monitoring
for
affected 
individuals
and
the
costs
of
providing
data
breach
notifications
to
affected
individuals
•
Plans
for
and
anticipated
costs
of
the
company’s
enhanced
cyber
security
program,
aimed
at 
preventing
future
data
breach
incidents
•
Estimates
of
the
potential
loss
in
sales
caused
by
damage
to
the
company’s
reputation
resulting 
from
the
data
breach
•
Anticipated
legal
costs
based
on
potential
litigation
that
could
be
filed
against
the
company
Moreover,
if
the
company
believes
that
there
is
a
relatively
high
risk
of
future
cyber
security/data
breach 
incidents
because
its
systems
are
not
effectively
securing
its
data,
the
business
should
disclose
such 
conditions
if
they
make
“…
investment
in
the
company
speculative
or
risky....” 
International
Laws
With
data
breaches
becoming
more
common,
specific
privacy
and
breach-related
requirements
are 
increasingly
being
enacted.
For
example,
the
European
Union
has
enacted
the
General
Data
Protection 
Regulation
(GDPR).
As
detailed
on
the
regulation’s
own
information
website,
the
regulation
is
aimed
at 
improving
security
for
all
companies
processing
personal
data
for
subjects
in
the
European
Union, 
regardless
of
the
company’s
location.
GDPR
states
that
organizations
can
be
fined
“up
to
4
percent
of 
annual
global
turnover
or
€20
million
(whichever
is
greater)”
for
the
most
serious
violations. 
Specifically
in
regard
to
breach
notification
requirements,
GDPR
makes
notification
mandatory
in
all 
member
states
when
a
breach
is
likely
to
result
in
a
substantial
risk
to
affected
individuals.
This 
notification
must
take
place
within
72
hours
of
the
company
becoming
aware
of
the
breach. 
Frequency
and
Costs
of
Electronic
Privacy
Breaches
The
number
of
new
malware
strains
is
growing
year-over-year
by
upwards
of
70
percent
according
to 
some
reports.
6
In
other
words,
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
strains
and
cyber
exposures
to 
contend
with
each
year
on
top
of
all
of
the
existing
threats. 
Accompanying
the
rapid
increase
in
malware
strains
is
the
fact
that
cyber
attacks
may
be
subject
to 
underreporting—although
this
trend
may
improve
over
time
as
reporting
obligations
continue
to
be
laid
23out
more
concretely
by
state
and
national
requirements. 
The
average
organizational
cost
of
a
data
breach
has
been
reported
around
$4.24
million,
trending 
upwards
from
previous
years.
The
estimated
cost
of
a
data
breach
on
a
per-record
basis
is
around
$160 
and
is
also
trending
upwards.
7 
Costs
associated
with
breaches
can
be
substantial
and,
in
some
cases,
astronomical.
For
instance,
in
what 
is
still
cited
as
one
of
the
most
extreme
cases
on
record,
a
2011
breach
of
the
marketing
firm
Epsilon
had 
some
analysts
predicting
the
costs
of
the
breach
could
reach
$4
billion. 
Effective
response
to
breaches
can
significantly
decrease
costs.
Utilizing
an
incident
response
team,
in 
combination
with
extensive
encryption,
has
been
shown
to
decrease
the
cost
of
a
data
breach
on
a 
per-record
basis
(potentially
by
around
10
percent). 
Smaller
Companies
Are
Not
Immune
to
Cyber
and
Privacy
Breaches
Many
small
businesses
believe
that
their
information
would
not
attract
cyber
thieves.
Unfortunately,
this 
belief
is
a
misperception.
Small
businesses
are
targeted
by
cyber
thieves
because
sensitive
information 
kept
by
small
businesses
is
often
much
easier
to
obtain
due
to
the
lack
of
sophisticated
security
measures, 
as
compared
with
larger
firms. 
In
addition,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
information
stolen
from
small
businesses
often
is
the 
owners’
personal
information.
Business
owners
that
use
their
personal
accounts
information
for
business 
transactions
face
a
higher
risk
of
identity
fraud. 
In
fact,
some
statistics
have
shown
that:
8 
•
More
than
60
percent
of
small
and
midsize
businesses
(SMBs)
may
experience
a
data
breach
in 
any
given
year.
•
SMBs
spend
an
average
of
more
than
$1
million
addressing
theft
of
IT
assets
and
other 
infrastructure
costs.
•
SMBs
face
an
average
of
nearly
$2
million
in
costs
related
to
disruption
of
operations
after
a
cyber 
incident.
•
Most
SMBs
are
reporting
that
the
time
required
to
respond
to
a
cyber
incident
has
either
remained 
unchanged
or
increased
over
time.
•
SMBs
often
feel
that
IT
leadership
is
lacking
at
their
organization,
and
compliance
efforts
are
a 
burden.
According
to
one
report,
around
56
percent
of
all
data
breaches
were
at
companies
with
less
than
1,000 
employees.
Among
this
size
of
employers,
system
intrusions
and
basic
Web
application
attacks
made
up 
the
vast
majority
of
incidents,
with
a
fairly
close
to
even
split
between
external
and
internal
bad
actors.
In 
many
ways,
small
businesses
were
exposed
to
the
same
types
of
incidents
that
their
larger
counterparts 
have
faced.
9 
24Key
Causes
of
Network
and
Privacy
Breaches
Causes
of
network
and
privacy
breaches
fall
under
two
categories:
(1)
human
error,
and
(2)
computer 
hacking/viruses.
The
latter
category
is
the
result
of
intentional
acts,
whereas
the
former
results
largely 
from
(1)
lost/stolen/compromised
laptops,
media,
smartphones,
and
tablets—all
of
which
were
left 
unattended,
were
poorly
secured,
or
lacked
encryption/strong
password
protection,
(2)
improper
disposal 
of
computer
data/devices,
(3)
employee
misuse
of
data/media,
or
(4)
vendor
negligence. 
Summary
Privacy
liability
is
often
incurred
by
a
company
when
its
computer
system
is
breached
by
a
hacker
and,
as 
a
consequence,
PII
is
released
to
unauthorized
persons.
However,
privacy
breaches
are
not
confined
to 
breaches
of
computer
networks
or
electronic
systems.
In
fact,
small
businesses
are
especially
vulnerable 
to
privacy
breaches
that
occur
by
nonelectronic
means. 
The
liability
incurred
by
businesses
results
from
a
patchwork
of
privacy
laws
that
have
been
enacted
in 
various
states.
Such
laws
indicate
that
responsibility
for
a
breach
lies
with
the
company
or
business
that 
collected
and
stored
the
affected
data.
Importantly,
as
of
the
time
of
writing
there
is
no
overarching
US 
federal
law
that
sets
standards
mandating
either
(1)
specific
data
protection
requirements,
or
(2)
definitive 
loss
notification
benchmarks
to
regulators
or
to
individuals
affected
by
a
breach.
However,
entities
like 
the
SEC
have
issued
guidance
that
encourages
companies
to
adequately
and
responsibly
disclose
privacy 
breaches. 
The
average
organizational
cost
of
a
data
breach
has
been
reported
upwards
of
$4
million
and
is
trending 
higher
compared
to
prior
years. 
Firms
of
all
types
and
sizes,
and
even
governmental
organizations,
have
reported
that
they
have
been
the 
victim
of
cyber-security
incidents
or
information
breaches.

First-Party
Property
Loss
Exposures
Overview
Cyber
activity
exposes
businesses
to
a
number
of
first-party
property
loss
exposures,
which
include
the 
following. 
•
Business
interruption
•
Dependent
business
interruption
•
Extra
expense
•
Data
asset
loss
•
Cyber
extortion
•
Computer
fraud
(or
“computer
crime”)
•
Funds
transfer
fraud
•
Miscellaneous
crime
losses
These
exposures
will
be
examined
in
the
pages
that
follow. 
Chapter
Objectives
This
chapter
addresses
the
eight
types
of
first-party
property
loss
exposures
to
which
businesses
are 
exposed
as
a
result
of
cyber
activities.
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the 
following. 
•
Recognize
the
nature
of
the
exposures.
•
Identify
the
specific
types
of
losses
that
can
happen
as
a
result
of
these
exposures.
26Business
Interruption
Business
interruption
losses
result
when
a
breach
of
or
malfunction
of
a
business’s
computer
systems 
causes
a
loss
of
income.
For
example,
a
business
interruption
loss
occurs
when
an
online
retailer
suffers
a 
loss
of
revenue
during
the
time
in
which
its
website
cannot
process
orders
because
it
has
been 
compromised
by
a
cyber
attack. 
Business
Interruption
Loss
Scenarios
The
following
are
examples
of
when
other
types
of
business
interruption
losses
can
arise. 
•
A
fast
food
restaurant
that
takes
online
orders
has
its
server
fail.
The
malfunction
causes
the 
restaurant
to
lose
sales
during
the
time
it
takes
to
get
operations
up
and
running
again.
•
An
electronic
order
system
must
be
shut
down
as
a
result
of
a
planned
upgrade
(performed
during 
off-hours)
that
is
required
by
a
rapidly
growing
Web-based
retailer.
The
additional
capacity
and
an 
upgrade
are
installed
incorrectly.
As
a
consequence,
the
upgrade
malfunctions
and
causes
several 
hours
of
downtime,
unfortunately
during
a
peak
period
for
receiving
orders.
The
company
suffers 
loss
of
revenue
when
customers
are
denied
access
to
the
system
during
the
busiest
part
of
the 
business
day.
•
Instead
of
developing
and
maintaining
its
own
website,
a
company
has
decided
to
outsource
all
of 
its
Web-related
activities.
As
part
of
the
arrangement,
it
allows
a
third
party
access
to
some
of
the 
company’s
internal
systems
to
keep
the
website
current.
During
routine
maintenance,
negligence 
by
the
third-party
website
operator
results
in
downtime
and
consequent
loss
of
revenue
for
the 
client.
(Recognize
that
the
third-party
operator
will/should
ultimately
be
held
liable
for
the
loss. 
However,
in
the
absence
of
the
third
party’s
ability
to
indemnify
its
client
for
the
loss,
the
client’s 
first-party
business
interruption
coverage
is
likely
to
be
the
sole
source
of
indemnification.)
Dependent
Business
Interruption
A
dependent
business
interruption
loss,
as
defined
by
those
insurers
whom
offer
this
coverage
within
their 
cyber
and
privacy
forms,
typically
results
from
the
failure
of
service
providers’
computer
systems
(rather 
than
the
insured’s
systems).
This
failure,
in
turn,
leads
to
an
interruption
in
the
insured’s
business
and
a 
subsequent
loss
of
revenue. 
More
specifically,
the
coverage
usually
applies
to
technology
service
providers.
These
technology
service 
providers
typically
perform
the
following
services
for
insureds. 
•
Maintaining,
managing,
or
controlling
computer
systems
•
Hosting
or
facilitating
the
insured’s
website
27•
Handling,
managing,
storing,
or
destroying
the
company’s
nonpublic
personal
information
and 
confidential
corporate
information
•
Other
information
technology
services
While
these
technology-related
services
are
representative
of
what
can
be
found
in
the
“service
provider” 
definition
in
many
insurers’
forms,
some
policies
also
state
that
“service
providers”
may
include
those 
that
perform
administrative,
human
resources,
marketing,
and
other
similar
services
for
insureds. 
A
Dependent
Business
Interruption
Loss
Scenario
Company
A,
a
midsize
retailer,
utilizes
its
website
for
the
vast
majority
of
its
customers’
purchase
orders 
(rather
than
maintaining
a
large
quantity
of
physical
storefronts).
Given
the
complexity
and
importance
of 
keeping
the
website
fully
functioning,
Company
A
hires
an
outside
technology
service
provider
to
host 
and
facilitate
the
website.
However,
the
service
provider
becomes
unable
to
maintain
Company
A’s 
website
for
a
period
of
several
days
during
the
holiday
season
due
to
an
internal
systems
failure
caused
by 
a
hacker
compromising
the
provider’s
computer
system.
This
causes
Company
A’s
online
shopping
cart 
to
be
unusable,
which
prevents
customers
from
placing
online
orders
and
results
in
a
substantial
loss
of 
revenue
for
Company
A
during
the
several
days
in
which
the
service
provider’s
system
is
rendered 
inoperable. 
Extra
Expense
An
extra
expense
loss
occurs
when
extraordinary
costs
must
be
incurred
to
minimize
the
time
during 
which
a
business’
electronic
network
is
rendered
inoperative. 
An
Extra
Expense
Loss
Scenario
A
major
credit
card
processor
suffers
a
data
breach,
which
requires
the
company
to
shut
down
its 
processing
systems.
However,
were
the
company
to
suspend
its
operations
for
any
significant
period
of 
time,
it
would
likely
lose
some
of
its
major
accounts
and
would
sustain
a
loss
from
which
it
may
never
be 
able
to
recover.
Accordingly,
the
credit
card
processor
must
expend
substantial
monies
to
first
ascertain 
the
source
of
the
breach,
then
address
and
remove
the
vulnerability,
and
then
take
steps
to
secure
its 
systems
to
prevent
a
subsequent
incursion.
Accomplishing
all
of
this
in
a
brief
period
of
time
(e.g.,
24 
hours
or
less)
may
necessitate
that
the
company
incurs
enormous
costs,
such
as
hiring
top-tier
experts; 
paying
double
or
triple
overtime
labor
charges;
and
purchasing
expensive,
state-of-the-art
data
protection 
systems. 
28Data
Asset
Loss
Just
as
malware
can
shut
down
a
company’s
operating
system,
so
too
can
it
destroy
valuable
data
assets. 
For
example,
a
virus
may
corrupt
and
make
a
company’s
customer
lists
unreadable
and
inaccessible. 
Similarly,
it
could
destroy
a
company’s
proprietary
software
programs. 
Data
Asset
Loss
Scenarios
An
online
retailer
suffers
a
cyber
attack,
rendering
its
customer
lists
no
longer
readable
or
usable. 
A
Wall
Street
brokerage
has
developed
a
proprietary
software
program
for
analyzing
the
financial 
statements
of
publicly
traded
businesses.
The
firm
uses
the
software
to
make
its
trading
decisions. 
Imposition
of
a
virus
by
a
hacker
damages
the
software
so
that
it
is
inoperable. 
In
both
instances,
the
affected
companies
maintain
backups
of
their
customer
lists
and
financial
analysis 
software,
respectively.
However,
properly
recovering
with
these
backups
requires
hiring
consultants
to 
assist
the
organizations—in
both
cases,
at
a
substantial
cost.
Note
also
that
both
companies
would
sustain 
business
interruption
losses
during
the
periods
of
time
in
which
they
could
not
operate
(i.e.,
during
the 
backup
recovery
period) 
29Cyber
Extortion
Cyber
extortion
occurs
when
a
criminal
threatens
to
damage
or
shut
down
a
company’s
electronic
systems 
unless
the
company
pays
the
criminal
a
specific
ransom
amount.
In
addition,
criminals
could
threaten
to 
expose
electronic
data
or
information
belonging
to
a
victim
if
the
target
does
not
pay
the
ransom 
demanded. 
Two
Cyber
Extortion
Loss
Scenarios
A
bank
receives
a
ransom
message
from
a
hacker
threatening
to
penetrate
its
customer
database
and 
disclose
all
of
its
individual
account
holders’
PII
if
the
bank
does
not
pay
$5
million. 
An
online
gaming
website
receives
a
message
from
a
hacker
demanding
that
$1
million
be
transferred
to
a 
bank
account
in
the
Cayman
Islands.
If
the
money
is
not
transferred
within
12
hours,
the
hacker
promises 
to
shut
down
the
website
and
disclose
sensitive
information. 
In
both
situations,
the
affected
businesses
might
choose
to
pay
the
respective
ransom
demands
and
suffer 
the
loss
of
$5
million
and
$1
million,
respectively.
Or,
alternatively,
they
could
ignore
the
demands
and 
potentially
suffer
losses
resulting
in
privacy
liability
(the
bank)
and
business
interruption
(the
gaming 
site). 
Ransomware
Yet
another
means
of
electronic
extortion
is
use
of
what
has
become
known
as
ransomware
.
In
using
this 
technique,
hackers
typically
compromise
an
organization’s
network
and
make
it
inaccessible
and/or
steal 
sensitive
data
to
“hold
hostage.”
Then,
a
ransom
demand
is
made,
to
be
paid
by
the
organization
in 
exchange
for
a
promise
that
the
hacker
will
restore
the
network
to
functionality
and/or
unencrypt
any 
stolen
data
(for
example,
an
organization
may
pay
a
ransom
in
the
hopes
that
a
hacker
will
stay
true
to
a 
promise
to
provide
an
unencryption
key
to
regain
access
to
data).
These
ransom
demands
are
often
made 
in
cryptocurrencies
so
as
to
be
harder
for
authorities
to
track
the
bad
actors. 
Ransomware
attacks
have
frequently
targeted
the
medical
industry,
largely
due
to
the
massive
quantity
of 
detailed
patient
records
with
sensitive
and
valuable
information.
However,
this
is
far
from
the
only 
impacted
industry.
As
hackers
have
learned
how
potentially
lucrative
this
attack
vector
is,
ransomware,
in 
general,
has
skyrocketed
in
prevalence.
This
rise
has
also
been
fueled
by
an
increase
in
remote
work
in 
the
aftermath
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic,
as
workers
use
potentially
less
secure
devices
in
their
home 
environment.
Now,
companies
of
virtually
every
size,
industry,
location,
and
so
on
are
exposed
to
serious 
threats
of
ransomware.
In
fact,
some
statistics
show
that
a
ransomware
incident
occurs
every
11 
seconds—and
average
downtime
while
recovering
from
a
ransomware
attack
can
be
about
3
weeks.
10
Payouts
have
been
made
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
to
regain
access
to
networks
and
data,
and 
average
ransomware
demands
have
ballooned
to
around
$200,000. 
As
incidents
of
this
type
become
more
sophisticated
and
difficult
to
defend,
potentially
resulting
in
more 
ransoms
actually
being
paid
out,
it
is
important
for
businesses
to
ensure
that
any
existing
cyber-extortion 
coverage
they
may
have
in
place
provides
sufficient
levels
of
protection
against
ransomware
scenarios. 
30Computer
Fraud
(or
“Computer
Crime”)
In
a
computer
fraud
situation,
after
gaining
access
to
a
company’s
network,
the
criminal
uses
such
access 
to
obtain
valuable
data
or
information.
This
is
frequently
in
contrast
to
a
cyber-extortion
scenario,
in 
which
the
actual
data
or
information
is
restored
if
the
company
gives
in
to
the
criminal’s
demands.
In
the 
extortion
scenario,
it
would
be
“bad
for
business”
if
hackers
were
to
develop
a
reputation
of
refusing
to 
relinquish
control
of
sensitive
information
even
after
a
company
paid
up.
Due
to
this,
companies
that
have 
been
breached
and
extorted
have
generally
found
that
hackers
follow
through
on
their
word
upon 
receiving
payment. 
Computer

who

crime
organization
accesses
a
retailer’s
online
ordering
system
and
steals
credit
card 
numbers
with
the
hopes
of
selling
the
information
on
the
dark
web. 
A
hacker
gains
access
to
an
online
stock
brokerage
account
that
contains
$50,000
in
cash.
Before
being 
blocked
from
making
further
transactions,
the
thief
uses
the
account’s
proceeds
to
pay
$25,000
in 
personal
bills. 
In
each
of
the
above
scenarios,
the
criminal
gains
access
to
a
business’
electronic
systems
and
then
uses 
such
access
to
obtain
something
of
value
(i.e.,
trade
secrets
and
cash,
in
these
respective
examples). 
Phishing
Phishing
constitutes
one
of
the
classic
computer
fraud
loss
scenarios.
Phishing
begins
by
sending
an
email 
message
falsely
claiming
to
be
from
a
lawful
business
or
“legitimate”
individual
and
then
directing
the 
recipient
to
visit
an
illegitimate
website
or
supply
sensitive
information
that
can
be
used
nefariously.
The 
recipient
is
often
asked
to
provide
personal
information,
such
as
Social
Security,
credit
card,
and
bank 
account
numbers.
Such
information
will
later
be
used
to
commit
identity
theft
or
another
kind
of
cyber 
wrongdoing. 
While
regular
phishing
uses
a
more
“shotgun”
targeting
approach,
“spear
phishing”
is
aimed
at
specific 
individuals
and/or
companies,
relying
on
the
use
of
personal
information
to
make
emails
appear 
convincing
and
trustworthy. 
31Funds
Transfer
Fraud
Funds
transfer
fraud
occurs
when
a
cyber
criminal
accesses
a
computer
network
and
then
uses
such
access 
to
fraudulently
transfer
monies
from
one
account
to
another. 
Funds
Transfer
Fraud
Loss
Scenario
A
credit
union
received
an
email
that
appeared
to
be
from
a
stock
brokerage
firm
but
was
not.
The
credit 
union’s
employee
opened
the
email,
which
activated
a
computer
virus
that
was
able
to
read
keystrokes 
entered
from
the
employee’s
computer.
The
criminal
used
this
information
to
access
the
account
number 
and
password
information
of
one
of
the
credit
union’s
customers
and
then
initiate
a
fraudulent
wire 
transfer
from
the
customer’s
credit
union
account
to
the
criminal’s
account
with
a
bank
in
Costa
Rica.
Computer
Fraud
versus
Funds
Transfer
Fraud
The
key
difference
between
computer
fraud
and
funds
transfer
fraud
is
that
the
latter
involves
the
transfer 
of
monies
from
one
financial
institution
to
another,
whereas
the
former
does
not
involve
a
two-way 
transfer
of
this
kind. 
Miscellaneous
Crime
Losses
A
number
of
crime
loss
types
do
not
fit
neatly
into
any
of
the
aforementioned
categories. 
32Exhibit
4.1
 
Miscellaneous
Cyber
Crime
Loss
Scenarios
•
Defacing
Web
pages.
Hackers
access
a
firm’s
website
and
change
pieces
of
information 
found
within
it,
wreaking
havoc
with
the
company’s
business.
However,
they
do
so
without 
actually
stealing
any
information,
merchandise,
or
funds.
•
Intercepting
emails
of
a
proprietary
nature.
A
competitor
gains
access
to
a
company’s 
email
system
and
learns
the
date
on
which
the
company
will
introduce
a
new
product.
This 
allows
the
competitor
to
accelerate
the
introduction
of
its
own
competing
product
before
its 
competitor’s
version
is
released.
•
Posting
embarrassing
material.
A
hacker
posts
pornographic
material
on
a
newspaper’s 
website.
The
newspaper
incurs
expenses
and
downtime
to
remove
the
hacked-in
material.
•
Posting
source
codes.
A
hacker
penetrates
the
internal
system
of
a
software
company
and 
posts
the
details
of
its
software
product
source
codes
on
a
website.
The
software
company 
incurs
costs
to
restore
its
system,
as
well
as
to
find
and
bring
a
lawsuit
against
the 
responsible
hacker.
•
Sabotage
by
employees.
A
programmer
for
a
publisher
is
terminated
from
employment. 
During
the
evening
of
the
day
he
is
terminated,
the
employee
logs
onto
the
employer’s 
internal
network.
The
former
employee
then
deletes
an
entire
issue
of
the
magazine,
along 
with
any
backups,
and
the
publisher
incurs
substantial
expenses
to
recreate
it.
•
Spamming.
Spam
is
unwanted
and
unsolicited
communications
or
traffic
sent
to
another’s 
website,
computer
systems,
or
networks.
A
massive
spam
attack
on
a
telephone
company 
takes
up
so
much
space
on
the
company’s
server
that
it
produces
a
degradation
in
service, 
causing
the
system
to
crash.
Summary
This
chapter
examined
the
eight
types
of
first-party

Emerging
Cyber
and
Privacy
Exposures
Overview
This
section
will
discuss
the
Internet
of
Things,
social
media,
and
cloud
computing
,
three
constantly 
evolving
cyber
exposures,
each
of
which
has
the
potential
to
generate
both
first-party
property
and 
third-party
liability
losses. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Recognize
exposures
associated
with
the
IoT,
social
media,
and
cloud
computing.
•
Identify
the
types
of
devices
that
make
up
the
IoT
and
the
unique
exposures
associated
with
each.
34The
Internet
of
Things
The
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
is
a
term
that
collectively
refers
to
the
everyday
devices
that
are
connected 
in
some
way
to
the
Internet.
Many
of
these
devices
are
referred
to
as
“smart”
devices:
smartphones,
smart 
homes
(Internet-capable
thermostats,
appliances,
and
so
on),
smart
televisions,
and
many
more
devices. 
Through
Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi,
and
other
wireless
communication,
users
of
smart
devices
are
able
to
control 
them
and
often
times
connect
them
functionally
with
other
smart
devices.
Connections
to
the
Internet 
allow
these
devices
to
track
usage
habits,
provide
useful
recommendations,
and
generally
offer
users
a 
more
interactive
and
feature-rich
experience. 
The
amount
of
IoT
devices
is
expected
to
continue
its
massive
growth.
With
this
growth
will
come
the 
continued
expansion
of
cyber
and
privacy
liability
exposures
due
to
security
challenges
inherent
in
these 
devices. 
The
range
of
IoT
cyber
attacks
that
have
made
the
news
covers
the
spectrum
from
absurd
(hacking
and 
speaking
through
baby
monitors
installed
near
cribs)
to
potentially
serious
(remotely
hacking
into
moving 
automobiles).
Part
of
the
widespread
nature
of
the
exposure
at
the
time
of
this
writing
seems
to
be
the 
“hacking
for
sport”
nature
of
some
of
these
acts;
often
times
there
is
no
apparent
end
goal
for
hackers 
outside
of
demonstrating
their
ability
to
gain
access
to
these
devices.
This
is
somewhat
contrary
to 
breaches
of
personally
identifiable
information
(PII),
for
example,
which
possess
financial
value
and 
thereby
serve
a
clear
purpose
for
financially
driven
hackers. 
Unfortunately,
the
more
troubling
exposures,
such
as
the
remote
override
of
moving
vehicles
alluded
to 
above,
have
serious
liability
implications
for
product
manufacturers.
In
the
event
of
a
serious
accident 
causing
damage,
injury,
or
death
that
is
traced
back
to
the
actions
of
a
hacker,
manufacturers
of
IoT 
devices
could
face
liability
for
failing
to
take
appropriate
measures
to
safeguard
such
devices
from 
unwanted
access.
In
the
event
that
a
smart
device
contains
personal,
potentially
embarrassing
information, 
cyber
and
privacy
liability
exposure
could
also
exist
for
the
manufacturer
in
the
event
that
such 
information
is
made
public. 
One
method
that
makers
of
IoT
devices
have
utilized
more
frequently
over
time
in
order
to
detect 
vulnerabilities
is
the
usage
of
“white
hat”
hackers,
or
hackers
tasked
with
finding
“holes”
in
security
and 
informing
the
company
so
that
it
may
take
action
to
resolve
them.
While
many
white
hat
hackers
have 
informed
companies
of
such
vulnerabilities
without
any
expectation
of
monetary
reward,
other
companies 
have
even
taken
the
step
of
offering
money
or
other
“prizes”
for
those
that
are
able
to
detect
and
report 
previously
unknown
security
issues. 
35Social
Media
Social
media
includes
Web-based
and
mobile-based
technologies
that
are
used
to
turn
communication 
into
interactive
dialogue
between
organizations,
communities,
and
individuals.
In
the
Business
Horizons 
article
“Users
of
the
World,
Unite!
The
Challenges
and
Opportunities
of
Social
Media,”
authors
Andreas 
Kaplan
and
Michael
Haenlein
define
social
media
as
“a
group
of
Internet-based
applications
that
build
on 
the
ideological
and
technological
foundations
of
Web
2.0,
and
that
allow
the
creation
and
exchange
of 
user-generated
content.” 
Social
media
technologies
take
on
many
different
forms
and
mediums,
including
feeds,
forums,
blogs, 
wikis,
podcasts,
photographs
or
pictures,
video,
product
rating,
and
dedicated
social
media
apps. 
According
to
Kaplan
and
Haenlein,
there
are
six
different
types
of
social
media. 
•
Collaborative
projects
(e.g.,
Wikipedia)
•
Blogs
and
microblogs
(e.g.,
Twitter)
•
Content
communities
(e.g.,
YouTube)
•
Social
networking
sites
(e.g.,
Facebook)
•
Virtual
game
worlds
(e.g.,
massively
multiplayer
online
games)
•
Virtual
social
worlds
(e.g.,
metaverse
projects)
Social
media
technologies
include
blogs,
picture-sharing,
vlogs,
“wall”
postings,
feeds,
email,
instant 
messaging,
music-sharing,
crowdsourcing,
and
voice
over
IP,
to
name
a
few.
Many
of
these
social
media 
services
can
be
integrated
via
social
network
aggregation
platforms.
Social
media
sites
include
Facebook, 
Twitter,
Instagram,
LinkedIn,
Reddit,
TikTok,
and
many
more. 
The
following
are
statistics
regarding
social
media
usage.
11 
•
There
are
nearly
4.5
billion
social
media
users
worldwide.
•
Average
users
engage
with
more
than
6
social
media
platforms.
•
Around
61
percent
of
the
global
population
uses
social
media.
•
93
percent
of
Internet
users
are
on
some
form
of
social
media.
•
The
average
person
spends
nearly
2.5
hours
per
day
on
social
media.
Social
Media
Legal
Liability
Exposures
Social
media
websites
have
users
numbering
in
the
billions,
including,
of
course,
employees.
Social 
media
has
exploded
on
the
scene
because
it
(1)
is
free,
(2)
is
accessible
to
all,
(3)
is
easy
to
use,
(4)
has
a 
broad
reach,
and
(5)
allows
for
instant
feedback. 
The
following
types
of
allegations
can
emanate
from
the
use
of
the
various
kinds
of
social
media.
36Privacy
Violations
A
company
that
digs
too
deeply
into
someone’s
personal
social
media
activities
can
expose
itself
to 
privacy
violation
claims—almost
a
kind
of
cyber
stalking!
These
claims
may
relate
to
the
disclosure
of 
medical
information
or
a
disability
(thereby
invoking
the
Americans
with
Disabilities
Act,
HIPAA,
and
a 
host
of
other
laws).
Such
disclosures
have
the
potential
to
generate
claims
involving
discrimination
on
the 
basis
of
marital
status,
sexual
orientation,
and
national
origin,
among
other
bases.
Clearly,
a
company
that 
improperly
relies
on
information
obtained
from
social
media
sites
to
make
discriminatory
decisions
in
the 
hiring
process,
or
uses
it
to
improperly
manage
its
employees
on
a
post-hire
basis,
can
set
itself
up
for 
breach
of
privacy
and
possibly
discrimination
claims. 
Most
employers
feel
they
have
the
right
to
access
any
information
that
is
publicly
displayed
on
their 
employees’
social
media
pages.
Conversely,
most
employees
felt
that
access
to
such
information
was 
none
of
their
employer’s
business. 
In
fact,
one
study
offered
the
following
insights.
12 
•
92
percent
of
recruiters
use
or
plan
to
use
social
media.
•
For
many
recruiters,
social
recruiting
ranks
ahead
of
ads,
employee
referrals,
and
job
boards.
•
2
million
small
businesses
are
using
LinkedIn
to
hire
employees.
•
86
percent
of
job
seekers
are
using
social
media
in
their
searches.
•
78
percent
of
recruiters
expect
the
use
of
social
media
in
recruiting
to
increase
from
current
levels.
Sexual
Harassment
and
Discrimination
Claims
As
is
the
case
with
many
forms
of
cyber
activity,
social
media
has
a
never-ending
shelf
life.
Once 
sexually
harassing
or
discriminatory
material
is
posted,
it’s
very
difficult
to
ever
be
truly
and
completely 
eradicated.
In
fact,
companies
that
actually
try
to
alter
and
remove
unfavorable
information
or
erase 
negative
comments
will
be
identified
and
harshly
criticized
by
online
communities,
a
number
of
which 
carefully
monitor
instances
of
Web
and
social
media
manipulation. 
Wrongful
Termination
Employees
who
are
disciplined
or
even
terminated
for
their
social
media-based
activities
can
claim
that 
the
termination
constituted
a
violation
of
public
policy
(i.e.,
infringement
on
privacy
rights)
or
First 
Amendment
rights,
or
make
a
claim
on
some
other
grounds.
In
City
of
Ontario
v.
Quon
,
560
U.S.
746 
(U.S.
2010),
a
police
officer
in
Ontario,
California,
sued
(although
his
wrongful
termination
claim
was 
eventually
rejected
by
the
US
Supreme
Court)
because
he
was
fired
for
using
the
cell
phone
issued
to
him 
(supposedly
for
professional
use)
for
excessive
texting
to
a
girlfriend.
The
officer
argued
that
simply 
because
he
was
given
a
phone
for
business
purposes
didn’t
mean
he
couldn’t
also
use
it
for
other
things, 
nor
was
he
warned
against
such
personal
use. 
In
August
2016,
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board
(NLRB)
confirmed
an
earlier
administrative
law 
judge’s
decision
that
Chipotle
had
erred
in
terminating
an
employee
that
had
been
critical
of
the
company 
on
social
media,
as
well
as
trying
to
limit
his
social
media
posts.
A
significant
aspect
of
the
ruling
was 
focused
on
whether
the
wording
and
requirements
of
Chipotle’s
employee
social
media
policy
were 
lawful.
As
reported
by
Kwabena
Appenteng
and
Philip
Gordon
in
the
August
30,
2016,
article
“NLRB 
Ruling
in
Social
Media
Case
Provides
Useful
Guidance
for
Employers,”
appearing
in
JD
Supra
Business 
Advisor
,
Chipotle’s
restrictions
on
false
and
disparaging
social
media
statements
were
“overbroad.” 
Specifically,
the
article
notes
that
the
ruling
“equated
‘disparaging’
statements
with
those
that
are 
derogatory
and
ruled
that
employees
have
a
protected
right
to
make
derogatory
statements
about
the
terms 
and
conditions
of
employment.”
As
a
result
of
the
ruling,
Chipotle
was
ordered
to
make
corresponding 
changes
to
its
social
media
policies
and
re-hire
the
affected
employee
(with
back
pay). 
The
Impact
of
Disgruntled
Employees
37Unhappy
employees
can
cause
considerable
damage
to
former
employers
using
social
media
postings. 
Their
derogatory
social
media
postings
can
cause
possible
new-hire
applicants
to
think
twice
about 
joining
the
firm,
and
sour
clients
and
competitors
on
the
organization.
Disgruntled
workers
can
also 
disclose
confidential
or
proprietary
information.
Just
as
an
employee
who
“says
too
much”
at
a
trade 
show
can
undermine
a
company’s
efforts
to
maintain
trade
secrets,
so
too
can
an
employee
who
does 
likewise
on
their
personal
or
company
social
networks. 
Third-Party
Lawsuits
Employees
who
inappropriately
make
comments
in
social
media
that
relate
to
clients,
customers,
other 
employees,
competitors,
or
other
third
parties
can
also
provoke
lawsuits
against
the
organization.
For 
example,
the
worker
who
talks
about
a
client
they
hated
or
an
employee
who
betrayed
them,
or
tries
to 
denigrate
the
company’s
products,
may
invite
lawsuits
for
libel
and/or
interference
with
business 
relationships
against
the
employer.
Employee
posts
on
social
media
may
also
expose
a
firm
to
fines
and 
penalties
brought
by
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
(FTC)
and
other
governmental
entities. 
38Cloud
Computing*
*Based
on
“How
Cloud
Computing
Works,”
by
Jonathan
Strickland. 
The
term
“cloud
computing”
means
anything
that
involves
delivering
what
are
considered
“hosted 
computing
services”
over
the
Internet.
A
cloud
computing
system
allows
workers
at
a
company
to
use
the 
resources
of
a
Web-based,
remotely
located
service
that
provides
for
all
the
computing
power
and
remote 
storage
requirements
the
individual
employee
would
need
to
perform
his
or
her
job.
Remote
machines 
owned
by
another
company
(i.e.,
the
“cloud
provider”)
run
everything
ranging
from
simple
tasks
to 
compute-heavy
processes
that
a
company
does
not
have
the
bandwidth
to
run
on
its
own.
Thus,
all 
electronic
and
data
processing
operations
that
would
ordinarily
take
place
on
an
in-house
basis
are 
handled
in
a
“cloud”
computing
system.
Cloud
computing
systems
can
generate
claims
alleging
data 
breaches
and
privacy
violations.
In
addition,
such
arrangements
have
the
potential
to
create
business 
interruption
losses. 
Key
Characteristics
of
a
“Cloud”
System
The
following
are
important
aspects
of
cloud
computing
systems. 
•
Resources
such
as
data
storage
space,
computer
applications,
and
computing
are
shared
by
all
of 
the
customers
of
a
cloud
vendor.
•
A
cloud
system
shifts
the
computing
and
data
storage
workload
from
the
end
user
to
the
cloud 
system
provider.
Accordingly,
the
end
user’s
computers
no
longer
have
to
do
the
work
of
running 
applications
because
the
network
of
computers
that
comprise
the
cloud
handles
them
instead.
•
By
using
a
cloud
provider,
the
end
user’s
need
for
both
hardware
and
software
is
reduced 
considerably.
•
Customers
do
not
own
the
cloud
provider’s
physical,
computer
network
infrastructure.
Instead,
by 
availing
themselves
of
the
provider’s
services,
companies
avoid
incurring
the
expenses
normally 
associated
with
hardware
and
software
ownership
because
they
rent
their
usage
from
the 
third-party
“cloud”
provider.
•
The
only
thing
the
user’s
computer
needs
to
be
able
to
do
is
run
the
cloud
computing
system’s 
application
software,
which
can
be
as
simple
as
a
remote
desktop
application
or
a
Web
browser 
interface.
The
cloud’s
network
handles
the
rest.
•
The
“front
end”
of
a
cloud
computing
system
includes
the
client’s
computer
or
computer
network 
and
the
application
required
to
access
the
cloud
computing
system.
•
On
the
“back
end”
of
the
system
are
the
various
computers,
servers,
and
data
storage
systems
that 
comprise
the
“cloud”
of
computing
services.
•
A
central
server
administers
the
system,
monitoring
traffic
and
client
demands,
to
ensure
that 
everything
runs
smoothly.
39•
A
cloud
computing
company
with
numerous
clients
will
likely
have
a
great
deal
of
storage
space 
and
might
need
thousands
of
digital
storage
devices
to
keep
all
its
clients’
information
stored. 
Some
of
the
largest
cloud
providers
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
servers.
•
A
cloud
computing
system
must
maintain
a
copy
of
all
its
clients’
data
and
store
it
on
other 
devices.
The
copies
allow
the
central
server
to
access
backup
machines
to
retrieve
data
that 
otherwise
would
be
unreachable
or
permanently
lost.
•
A
“public
cloud”
operates
outside
of
the
company’s
computer
network,
and
it
is
provided
by
a 
third
party.
Why
a
Cloud
Provider
Can
Enhance
the
Security
of
a
Company’s
Data
However
valid
a
business’
concerns
regarding
the
security
of
its
data
when
it
is
in
the
possession
of
a 
cloud
provider,
it
can
also
be
argued
that
a
cloud
provider’s
entire
reputation
is
based
on
the
ironclad 
security
provided
by
its
(hopefully)
state-of-the-art
protection
systems.
Compared
to
a
company
that 
manufactures
the
proverbial
“widgets,”
a
cloud
provider
can
assert
that
it
is
surely
in
a
better
position
to 
protect
the
widget
manufacturer’s
crucial
data
than
the
widget
manufacturer
itself
is.
Since
a
cloud 
provider
would
be
in
danger
of
losing
many
of
its
accounts
and
suffering
reputational
damage
if
it
were
to 
suffer
a
data
breach,
the
cloud
provider’s
customers
can
be
confident
that
it
will
make
every
possible 
effort
to
secure
its
customers’
data. 
Property
and
Liability
Exposures
Resulting
from
Cloud
Computing
The
three
most
significant
exposures
produced
by
cloud
computing
involve
(1)
data
breach,
(2)
privacy 
breach,
and
(3)
business
interruption
loss. 
Data
Breach
Many
businesses
are
philosophically
opposed
to
the
idea
of
handing
over
their
critical
data
to
a
third 
party—no
matter
how
reliable
the
cloud
provider
or
regardless
of
how
strong
the
indemnification 
agreements
that
backstop
such
arrangements.
Since
companies
already
face
a
challenge
in
protecting
their 
data,
many
firms
are
simply
not
comfortable
with
the
fact
that
another
organization
will
have
custody
and 
control
of
what
is,
in
effect,
the
“life
blood”
of
its
entire
operation. 
Thus,
when
a
company
engages
in
a
relationship
with
a
cloud
provider,
the
security
of
its
entire
database 
is
dependent
on
the
strength
of
the
cloud
provider’s
security
systems. 
The
Risks
of
Cloud
Storage
Cloud
storage,
similar
to
cloud
computing,
allows
clients
to
store
data
on
remote
servers
in
the
cloud, 
making
it
accessible
from
many
different
devices
and
shareable
with
others. 
Of
course,
cloud
storage
is
an
appealing
option
for
those
that
have
(1)
massive
amounts
of
data
in
their 
control,
which
would
not
be
feasible
to
store
“in-house,”
and/or
(2)
highly
sensitive,
private
information 
that
they
are
more
inclined
to
trust
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
cloud
storage
provider.
Unfortunately, 
both
of
these
aspects
that
make
cloud
storage
useful
also
provide
for
tantalizing
targets
for
malicious 
hackers. 
In
late
August
2016,
the
popular
cloud
storage
company
Dropbox
announced
that
a
hack
dating
back
to 
2012
had
exposed
the
user
IDs
and
password
of
approximately
68
million
users,
as
reported
in
The 
Economic
Times
.
The
company
subsequently
forced
many
users
to
reset
their
passwords
upon
their
next 
attempted
login. 
While
this
hack
immediately
compromised
user
credentials
rather
than
the
stored
data
itself,
it
still
serves 
to
illustrate
the
potential
risk
in
utilizing
the
services
of
cloud
storage
companies,
which
make
for 
potentially
appetizing
cyber
targets. 
Privacy
Breach
Since
a
cloud
customer
can
log
on
from
any
location
to
access
data
and
applications,
the
client’s
privacy
40could
be
compromised
if,
for
example,
a
hacker
were
to
somehow
gain
access
to
the
system
and
release 
the
PII
of
a
company’s
customers. 
To
counteract
this
exposure,
cloud
providers
employ
the
most
sophisticated
and
up-to-date
authentication 
techniques,
such
as
utilizing
encryption
and
requiring
“strong”
usernames
and
passwords
in
conjunction 
with
multifactor
authentication
(for
example,
a
user
signing
in
on
their
laptop
may
also
be
prompted
to 
enter
a
SMS
code
that
is
texted
to
their
cell
phone).
Another
effective
security
measure
is
to
implement
a 
strict
authorization
format,
whereby
each
user
can
only
access
the
data
and
applications
that
pertain
to 
their
respective
job
or
department
within
the
company
(the
security
principle
of
“least
privilege”). 
Business
Interruption
The
possibility
of
physical
damage
to
a
cloud
provider’s
premises
or
an
internal
system
failure—not 
caused
by
physical
damage—creates
the
chance
that
a
client’s
electronic
systems
could
be
rendered 
inoperable
and
its
data
inaccessible
for
a
given
period
of
time.
Both
types
of
situations
could
produce
a 
loss
of
income
during
the
respective
periods
of
outage. 
Despite
such
possibilities,
the
question
again
arises
as
to
whether
a
client
is
better
able
to
ensure
that
such 
interruptions
would
not
occur
than
the
cloud
provider
is.
Since
the
provider’s
entire
business
rests
on
its 
ability
to
prevent
these
types
of
situations,
a
business
must
realistically
evaluate
whether
it
may,
in
fact, 
be
better
off
entrusting
the
operation
of
its
electronic
systems
to
a
specialist
rather
than
attempting
to 
forestall
such
events
using
purely
in-house
resources. 
Summary
The
Internet
of
Things,
social
media,
and
cloud
computing
are
three
constantly
evolving
forms
of 
electronic
activity
that,
in
their
own
unique
way,
can
generate
both
property
and
liability
exposures
for
a 
business. 
The
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
consists
of
a
variety
of
everyday
devices
that
are
connected,
in
some
degree, 
to
the
Internet.
As
the
growth
of
such
devices
continues,
so
too
do
the
cyber
and
privacy
liability 
exposures
associated
with
them. 
There
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
social
media. 
•
Collaborative
projects
(e.g.,
Wikipedia)
•
Blogs
and
microblogs
(e.g.,
Twitter)
•
Content
communities
(e.g.,
YouTube)
•
Social
networking
sites
(e.g.,
Facebook)
•
Virtual
game
worlds
(e.g.,
massively
multiplayer
online
games)
•
Virtual
social
worlds
(e.g.,
metaverse
applications)
Social
media
has
the
potential
to
generate
claims
alleging
(1)
privacy
violations,
(2)
sexual 
harassment/discrimination,
(3)
wrongful
termination,
(4)
damage
caused
by
disgruntled
employees,
and 
(5)
damage
caused
to
other
third
parties. 
A
cloud
computing
system
allows
workers
at
a
company
to
utilize
a
Web-based
service
that
provides 
necessary
computing
power
and
bandwidth
and
hosts
all
the
programs
the
individual
employee
would 
need
to
perform
their
job.
Remote
machines
owned
by
another
company
(i.e.,
the
“cloud
provider”)
run 
everything
ranging
from
mundane
tasks
to
complex,
compute-heavy
processes.
Thus,
many
electronic
and 
data
processing
operations
that
would
ordinarily
take
place
on
an
in-house
basis
can
be
handled
in
a 
“cloud”
computing
system.
Cloud
computing
systems
can
generate
claims
alleging
data
breaches
and 
privacy
violations.
In
addition,
such
arrangements
have
the
potential
to
create
business
interruption
losses.

Cyber
and
Privacy
Loss
Control
Overview
As
is
the
case
with
any
loss
exposure,
despite
the
fact
that
insurance
coverage
has
been
arranged,
no 
insurance
policy
can
cover
every
possible
aspect
of
all
losses.
Given
the
presence
of
limits,
retentions, 
exclusions,
and
the
administrative
time
required
to
work
with
insurers
in
settling
claims,
companies
will 
end
up
self-insuring
substantial
portions
of
nearly
every
cyber
and
privacy
loss,
regardless
of
the 
existence
of
insurance
coverage.
Thus,
businesses
have
a
clear
interest
in
preventing
cyber
and
privacy 
claims.
And
in
the
event
that
losses
cannot
be
avoided,
such
losses
can,
in
many
instances,
be
controlled 
once
they
occur.

Steps
To
Reduce
Cyber
and
Privacy
Loss
Exposures
There
are
a
number
of
loss
control
steps
that
an
organization
can
take
to
reduce
its
exposure
to
cyber
and 
privacy
losses.

13
Steps
To
Reduce
Cyber
and
Privacy
Loss
Exposures
1.
Centralize
responsibility
for
data
security.
2.
Fill
out
an
application
for
coverage.
3.
Have
a
cyber
audit
by
an
outside
firm.
4.
Monitor
and
manage
outside
service
providers.
5.
Get
a
handle
on
laptops,
mobile
phones,
and
other
portable
electronic
devices.
6.
Develop
and
test
an
incident
response
plan.
7.
Train
employees
on
how
to
spot
“phishing”
attempts.
8.
Encrypt
data.
9.
Design
systems
to
handle
higher-than-normal
volumes
of
data.
10.
Secure
physical
servers.
11.
Limit
online
data
collection.
12.
Use
liability
disclaimers.
13.
Employ
email
security
techniques.
Centralize
Responsibility
for
Data
Security
The
first
step
in
preventing
cyber
and
privacy
losses
is
to
create
centralized
responsibility
for
identifying 
and
correcting
weak
points
in
an
organization’s
computer
security
system.
This
may
be
the
responsibility 
of
the
company’s
chief
information
officer,
management
information
system
manager,
information 
technology
(IT)
manager,
chief
technology
officer,
or
risk
manager.
The
crucial
point
is
that
a
single 
individual
should
be
ultimately
accountable
(with
the
support
of
team
members
along
the
way,
of
course) 
for
discovering
and
fixing
any
cyber
and
privacy-related
vulnerabilities.
Or,
for
example,
within
the
IT 
department
in
large
companies,
an
individual
with
the
title
of
Information
Security
Director
would
have 
this
responsibility. 
Fill
Out
an
Application
for
Insurance
Coverage
Given
the
detailed
nature
of
the
questions
it
contains
regarding
a
businesses’
cyber-security/loss
control 
program,
an
application
for
cyber-insurance
coverage
serves
as
a
“self-audit.”
By
completing
an 
application
for
coverage,
a
company
is
compelled
to
assess
its
risks
and
vulnerabilities
to
cyber
loss.
The 
exercise
also
requires
the
applicant
to
quantify
potential
losses
(given
the
questions
regarding
areas
such 
as
numbers
of
transactions,
customer
records,
sales
volumes,
and
business
locations).
Answers
to
these 
kinds
of
questions
will
help
in
selecting
appropriate
policy
limits
and
understanding
the
full
scope
of
risk. 
Lastly,
by
completing
an
application
for
coverage,
support
within
the
organization
is
likely
to
rise
for
an 
outside
audit
of
the
business—one
that
will
provide
a
truly
objective
assessment
of
the
company’s 
cyber-risk
profile. 
Have
a
Cyber
Audit
by
an
Outside
Firm
Only
an
outside
expert
can
provide
a
truly
objective
assessment
of
a
businesses’
cyber-protection
status. 
Insurers
are
excellent
sources
of
qualified
auditors,
and
most
carriers
will
be
more
than
happy
to 
recommend
a
list
of
experienced
providers. 
As
a
complement
to
an
outside
audit,
some
businesses
also
engage
“white
hat
hackers”
who
attempt
to 
penetrate
their
computer
systems.
This
exercise
is
yet
another
means
of
assessing
the
effectiveness
of
a 
company’s
cyber-protection
system. 
Frequently,
there
will
be
internal
opposition
to
an
outside
audit,
especially
from
a
company’s
IT 
department,
which
may
consider
the
company’s
cyber
security
and
data
protection
regime
to
already
be
at 
a
“state
of
the
art
level.”
Nevertheless,
an
outside
audit
should
be
insisted
upon.
43As
a
result
of
having
had
such
an
audit,
an
insurer
is
likely
to
provide
a
quotation
for
cyber
and
privacy 
coverage
that
affords
a
lower
premium,
higher
limits,
and
broader
coverage
than
if
the
insured
had
not 
undergone
an
independent
review
of
its
cyber
exposures.
In
many
cases,
the
prospective
insured
may
not 
even
have
an
option—some
form
of
outside
audit
may
be
a
required
step
in
the
application
process, 
depending
on
the
size
and
nature
of
the
risk. 
Monitor
and
Manage
Outside
Service
Providers
Since
a
high
percentage
of
data
breaches
and
other
cyber
incidents
result
from
the
negligence
of
outside 
service
providers,
it
is
imperative
that
businesses
manage
these
relationships
effectively
and
in
a
manner 
that
prevents
losses
and
contractually
shifts
financial
responsibility
(to
the
contractor)
in
situations
where 
losses
are
the
result
of
the
technology
contractor’s
actions. 
Limit
Access
To
the
extent
possible,
businesses
should
limit
access
to
their
computer
systems
by
third-party 
contractors.
A
number
of
high
profile
(and
extremely
costly)
cyber
incidents
have
resulted
from
the 
negligence
of
outside
contractors,
which
permitted
hackers
to
gain
access
to
clients’
computer
systems. 
Require
Hold
Harmless
Agreements
Outside
service
providers
should
be
required
to
sign
hold
harmless
agreements
in
which
they
agree
to 
indemnify
the
business
if
the
contractor’s
negligence
is
the
cause
of
a
loss.
Importantly,
however,
the 
value
of
such
an
agreement
is
negligible
in
the
absence
of
funds
available
to
honor
the
indemnification 
commitment
and
should
be
in
the
form
of
an
insurance
policy
purchased
by
the
technology
provider. 
Require
Service
Providers
To
Buy
Technology
E&O
Insurance
Requiring
contractors
to
purchase
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O)
coverage
assures
that
funds 
will
be
available
to
fulfill
the
loss
assumption
obligations
contained
within
hold
harmless
agreements. 
Businesses
should
be
wary
of
dealing
with
technology
providers
that
do
not
maintain
and/or
resist 
purchasing
such
coverage. 
Get
a
Handle
on
Laptops,
Mobile
Phones,
and
Other
Portable
Electronic
Devices
The
Ponemon
Institute’s
landmark
study,
The
Billion
Dollar
Lost
Laptop
Problem,
indicated
that
the
329 
organizations
surveyed
lost
more
than
86,000
laptops
over
the
course
of
a
year.
These
findings,
coupled 
with
the
survey
Business
Risk
of
a
Lost
Laptop
,
estimated
that
the
average
cost
per
lost
laptop
was 
$49,246,
with
a
total
annual
cost
amounting
to
more
than
$2.1
billion,
or
$6.4
million
per
organization. 
Following
are
some
other
key
findings
of
the
report. 
•
While
46
percent
of
the
lost
laptops
contained
confidential
data,
only
30
percent
of
those
were 
encrypted.
•
Only
10
percent
of
the
laptops
contained
any
antitheft
technologies.
•
71
percent
of
the
laptops
lost
did
not
have
their
data
backed
up.
Given
the
magnitude
of
these
exposures,
businesses
need
to
provide
employees
with
laptops,
mobile 
phones,
and
other
portable
electronic
devices
that
do
the
following. 
•
Uses
strong
passwords
(i.e.,
a
minimum
of
12
characters,
with
at
least
one
capital
letter,
one 
number,
and
one
special
character)
•
Employs
two-factor
authentication
(e.g.,
users
are
prompted
to
enter
an
SMS
code
that
is
texted
to 
them
before
they
can
complete
the
sign-in
process
on
their
laptop)
•
Is
equipped
with
antivirus
software
•
Adequately
encrypts
and
backs
up
data
44•
Follows
the
“least
privilege”
security
principle
(i.e.,
individual
users
only
have
access
to 
documents
and
programs
that
they
truly
need
access
to,
as
opposed
to
broad
access
to
all
company 
files)
45Develop
and
Test
an
Incident
Response
Plan
As
referred
to
earlier
in
this
course,
the
average
cost
per
stolen
electronic
record
is
around
$160.
Yet, 
when
a
company
that
suffers
a
breach
has
an
incident
response
plan
in
place,
the
per-record
cost
can
often 
be
reduced
by
nearly
10
percent.
This
difference
matters
considerably
when
millions
of
records
are 
involved.
The
specific
aspects
of
such
a
plan
should
include
the
following. 
•
A
written
plan
noting
exactly
what
must
be
done
in
responding
to
an
incident
and
then
restoring 
operations
as
quickly
as
possible.
•
A
public
relations
strategy
explaining
how
the
company
will
respond
to/manage
customer 
complaints
in
the
event
of
a
shutdown.
The
strategy
should
indicate
the
name
of
a
public
relations 
(PR)
agency
and
with
whom
a
contract
has
already
been
negotiated.
PR
agencies
may
also
be 
utilized
through
a
company’s
cyber-insurance
policy
(i.e.,
they
can
rely
on
the
PR
agencies
that
are 
partnered
with
their
insurer).
•
A
formal
test
of
the
plan.
It
does
no
good
to
have
a
written
plan
that
merely
sits
on
a
shelf. 
Therefore,
the
response
plan
should
actually
be
tested
at
some
point.
Many
cyber
insurers
offer 
services
in
which
insureds
can
participate
in
guided
“tabletop”
exercises
to
walk
through 
hypothetical
incidents
with
cyber-security
experts.
Train
Employees
on
How
To
Spot
Phishing
Attempts
A
high
percentage
of
data
breaches
are
caused
by
“phishing,”
a
technique
already
described
in
Chapter
4. 
Phishing
is
used
as
a
sort
of
preliminary
step
to
implant
malware
and/or
steal
entry
credentials.
Phishing 
is
also
employed
as
a
means
of
requesting
fund
transfers,
a
technique
known
as
“social
engineering.” 
Fortunately,
many
effective
software
training
packages
are
now
available
that
teach
employees
how
to 
recognize
phishing
emails.
After
completing
these
training
modules,
employees
should
then
be
sent 
follow-up
mock
phishing
emails
as
a
test
of
whether
they
immediately
recognize
them
as
phishing 
attempts.
Falling
for
the
mock
phishing
email
should
result
in
a
constructive
follow-up
in
which
the 
employee
learns
what
red
flags
should
have
signaled
the
email’s
illegitimacy. 
Encrypt
Data
Encryption
software
scrambles
data,
making
the
data
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
decipher.
Encryption 
is
an
excellent
risk
control
technique
because
it
is
both
inexpensive
as
well
as
relatively
easy
for
an
IT 
department
to
implement. 
Design
Systems
To
Handle
Higher-than-Normal
Volumes
of
Data
A
website
that
can
handle
significantly
more
traffic
than
normally
anticipated
makes
a
company
less
46vulnerable
to
distributed
denial-of-service
attacks
by
hackers
or
competitors
who
attempt
to
flood
a 
system
with
traffic
(i.e.,
“spamming”)
in
an
effort
to
shut
it
down. 
Secure
Physical
Servers
Access
to
a
business’
servers
should
be
strictly
limited.
In
addition,
companies
need
to
use
locks,
as
well 
as
all
standard
hazard
protections,
including
halogen
fire
protection
systems,
to
protect
servers
and
the 
rooms
in
which
they
are
housed. 
Limit
Online
Data
Collection
Web
servers
retain
a
great
deal
of
information
about
website
visitors’
personal
information
(e.g.,
what
site 
they
came
from,
browsing
preferences,
some
demographic
data,
and
so
on).
Businesses
should
know 
exactly
what
information
is
being
collected
and
stored,
and
both
should
be
minimized.
This
is
especially 
true
in
light
of
the
European
Union’s
General
Data
Protection
Regulation
(GDPR),
which
implemented 
much
more
strict
guidelines
on
data
protection
and
privacy
and
can
extend
to
anyone
doing
business
with 
customers
in
the
European
Union. 
Credit
card
and
payment
data
should
also
be
erased
when
it
is
no
longer
needed.
These
techniques
will
go 
a
long
way
in
mitigating
privacy
claims
down
the
road. 
Use
Liability
Disclaimers
Liability
disclaimers
can
limit
a
company’s
liability
to
customers
in
the
event
that
third
parties
illegally 
obtain
their
customers’
PII,
although
these
disclaimers
are
by
no
means
bulletproof.
A
business
should 
prominently
post
liability
disclaimers
on
customer-facing
mediums. 
Employ
Email
Security
Techniques
Employees
should
be
advised
to
use
caution
when
communicating
via
email
since
documents
traveling 
over
the
Internet
are
not
secure
unless
encrypted.
Security
concerns
are
legitimate
but
addressable. 
Corporations
are
wise
to
invest
in
encryption
software
and
to
develop
email
guidelines
that
reduce
the 
odds
of
interlopers
intercepting
sensitive
information
on
the
Internet. 
47Exhibit
6.2
 
Email
Security
Techniques
1.
Use
common
sense
and
discretion.
Do
not
put
anything
in
an
email
that
you
would
not 
want
printed
on
the
front
page
of
your
local
newspaper
or
read
aloud
in
a
courtroom,
since 
email
messages
are
discoverable
in
litigation.
2.
Do
not
use
for
sensitive
items.
Do
not
use
email
for
sensitive,
risk-related
information,
such 
as
conveying
proprietary
data.
This
is
particularly
true
with
attachments
to
emails,
which
can 
often
involve
highly
sensitive
documents.
Such
documents
should
be
shared
in
a
more 
secure
way
(e.g.,
via
file
sharing
services
built
for
sending
sensitive,
secured
information 
between
parties).
3.
Recognize
the
lack
of
security
in
email
communications.
Remember
that,
in
general, 
emails
are
often
no
more
secure
than
communications
sent
through
nonelectronic
means. 
This
should
temper
the
sending
of
message
content
that
could
be
considered
“extreme.”
Summary
There
is
no
single
technique
or
method
to
reduce
the
threat
of
cyber
and
privacy
claims.
However,
by 
adhering
to
the
program
laid
out
in
this
chapter,
an
organization
will
vastly
reduce
the
threat
of
sustaining 
a
loss.
These
approaches
include
(1)
centralizing
responsibility
for
data
security,
(2)
filling
out
an 
application
for
cyber
insurance
coverage,
(3)
having
a
cyber
audit
by
an
outside
firm,
(4)
monitoring
and 
managing
outside
service
providers,
(5)
getting
a
handle
on
laptops,
mobile
phones,
and
other
portable 
electronic
devices,
(6)
developing
and
testing
an
incident
response
plan,
(7)
training
employees
on
how
to 
spot
phishing
attempts,
(8)
encrypting
data,
(9)
designing
systems
to
handle
higher-than-normal
volumes 
of
data,
(10)
securing
physical
servers,
(11)
limiting
online
data
collection,
(12)
using
liability 
disclaimers,
and
(13)
employing
email
security
techniques.

Underwriting
Cyber
and
Privacy 
Insurance
Overview
Underwriting
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
presents
a
number
of
challenges.
First,
the
forms
cover
a
wide 
variety
of
both
property
and
liability
exposures,
including
information
security,
privacy,
and
content 
liability.
In
addition,
cyber
and
privacy
policies
also
cover
a
number
of
first-party
property
losses, 
including
business
interruption,
extra
expense,
and
various
types
of
cyber-related
crime
perils,
such
as 
cyber
extortion
and
electronic
fraud
(to
name
a
few).
Also,
compared
to
other,
more
established
lines
of 
insurance,
insurers
lack
a
substantial
database
of
specific
types
of
losses
on
which
to
price
certain 
insuring
agreements.
Lastly,
the
nature
of
the
cyber
and
privacy
exposure
is
rapidly
evolving,
requiring 
extra
vigilance
from
the
market
to
utilize
appropriate
policy
wording
and
pricing
so
as
to
manage
loss 
ratios. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Recognize
how
cyber
and
privacy
policies
are
rated
and
priced.
•
Identify
the
various
factors
underwriters
use
to
modify
basic
rates.
•
Recognize
other
factors
considered
in
the
underwriting
decision-making
process,
which
include 
internal
security
measures,
personnel
policies
and
procedures,
information
security
approaches,
the 
nature
of
a
company’s
website
and
content
information,
the
extent
to
which
it
transfers
its
cyber 
and
privacy
risks
to
technology
providers
by
contractual
means,
and
loss
history.
Pricing
Cyber
and
Privacy
Policies
Compared
to
more
“traditional”
lines
of
insurance,
cyber
and
privacy
coverage
is
a
relatively
new
form
of 
insurance,
having
been
introduced
in
the
early
2000s.
Therefore,
even
the
largest
insurers
lack
a 
substantial
amount
of
historical
loss
data.
Thus,
pricing
such
policies
is
at
times
a
fairly
subjective 
process
and,
in
part,
dependent
on
an
underwriter’s
individual
judgment
concerning
any
particular
risk.
49Rating
Base
Premiums
for
each
of
the
different
insuring
agreements
correlate
with,
though
they
are
not
directly
based 
upon,
the
size
of
a
business’s
assets
and/or
its
number
of
electronic
records,
in
combination
with
the 
business’s
tangible
cyber-security
practices,
loss
history,
industry,
and
more.
Like
other
lines
of 
insurance,
policy
premiums
are
adjusted
annually
to
reflect
changes
in
actual
exposure. 
Pricing
Is
on
a
Per-Insuring
Agreement
Basis
It
should
be
recognized
that
cyber
and
privacy
coverage
is
priced
on
a
per-insuring
agreement
basis.
That 
is,
a
separate
rate
will
be
applied
to
each
of
the
coverages
selected
under
a
policy.
For
example,
a 
cyber-policy
form
may
contain
the
following
eight
insuring
agreements. 
•
Network
Security
Liability
Coverage
•
Privacy
Liability
Coverage
•
Privacy
Breach
Expenses
Coverage
•
Regulatory
Fines
and
Proceeding
Coverage
•
Internet
Media
Liability
Coverage
•
Digital
Asset
Expenses
Coverage
•
Business
Interruption
and
Income
Loss
Coverage
•
Network
and
Data
Extortion
Threat
and
Reward
Payments
Coverage
An
insured
could
conceivably
select
anywhere
from
just
one
all
the
way
up
to
eight
different
coverages, 
each
of
which
carries
a
different
rate.
Moreover,
the
final
premium
for
each
coverage
selected
will
be 
modified
by
the
limit
and
retention
selected,
since
different
limits/retentions
are
available
for
each
of
the 
eight
available
coverages. 
Annual
Aggregate
Limit
Lastly,
in
addition
to
pricing
the
policy’s
individual
insuring
agreements,
cyber
and
privacy
forms
are 
also
subject
to
an
annual
aggregate
limit,
which
is
separately
rated. 
50Modification
Factors
The
pricing
of
cyber/privacy
coverage
is
sometimes
subject
to
modification,
based
on
several
factors, 
which
include
the
following. 
•
Network
security
measures
•
Personnel,
policies,
and
procedures
•
Information
security
•
Website
and
content
information
•
Extent
of
contractual
risk
transfer
•
Loss
history
Network
Security
Measures
Underwriters
will
look
favorably
on
applicants
that
(1)
have
a
designated
chief
security
officer
who
is 
responsible
for
the
firm’s
computer
systems;
(2)
have
a
formal
program
to
test
or
audit
network
security 
controls;
(3)
use
firewall
technology;
(4)
use
both
antivirus
and
encryption
software
that
is
installed
on
all 
of
their
computer
systems,
including
(a)
laptops,
(b)
personal
computers,
and
(c)
networks;
(5)
use 
intrusion
detection
software
to
detect
unauthorized
access
to
internal
networks
and
computer
systems;
(6) 
have
adopted
a
corporate
policy
to
upgrade
all
security
software
as
new
releases
or
improvements
become 
available;
(7)
provide
remote
access
to
their
network
using
a
virtual
private
network;
(8)
use
a 
multi-factor
authentication
process
or
a
layered
security
approach
to
verify
the
identity
of
a
customer
or 
authorized
user
when
granting
access
to
secure
areas
of
the
company’s
website;
(9)
use
remote
deposit 
capture
technology
when
sending
or
accepting
financial
transactions
intended
for
deposit;
(10)
(a)
have
a 
disaster
recovery
plan,
(b)
have
a
business
continuity
plan
(c)
have
an
incident
response
plan
for
network 
intrusions
and
virus
incidents,
and
(d)
test
such
plans
regularly;
(11)
have
a
secondary
computer
system
or 
site
available
if
the
primary
system
becomes
inoperative
and
(a)
are
able
to
operationalize
such
secondary 
resources
immediately
and
(b)
have
designed
the
secondary
system
so
it
can
handle
a
high
percentage
of 
the
company’s
operations;
and
(12)
back
up
all
valuable
and
sensitive
data
on
a
regular
basis. 
Personnel,
Policies,
and
Procedures
Insurers
seek
to
insure
companies
that
(1)
regularly
conduct
training
on
security
issues
and
procedures
for 
employees
who
utilize
computer
systems,
(2)
publish
and
distribute
written
computer
and
information 
systems
policies
and
procedures
to
their
employees,
(3)
terminate
all
associated
computer
access
and
user 
accounts
as
part
of
the
regular
exit
process
when
an
employee
leaves
the
company,
and
(4)
have
a
formal 
documented
procedure
in
place
for
creating
and
periodically
updating
passwords
used
by
employees
and
51customers. 
Information
Security
The
manner
in
which
an
applicant
handles
its
data
is
another
critical
factor
that
underwriters
evaluate. 
Types
of
Data
Maintained
First,
an
insurer
is
interested
in
learning
about
the
actual
types
of
data
collected
by
a
company.
Such
data 
types
include
(a)
credit/debit
card
numbers,
(b)
Social
Security
numbers,
(c)
intellectual
property 
belonging
to
others,
(d)
medical
information,
(e)
employee/human
resources
information,
(f)
bank 
accounts
and
records,
and
(g)
customer
information. 
Number
of
Individual
Records
Next,
underwriters
seek
the
number
of
individual
records
containing
one
or
more
types
of
the
preceding 
types
of
information
that
an
applicant
company
stores.
The
smallest
risks
often
have
fewer
than
1,000, 
whereas
the
largest
may
have
in
excess
of
100
million.
Of
course,
the
larger
the
number
of
stored
records, 
the
more
premium
an
underwriter
may
require
for
a
given
limit
of
liability. 
Information
Security
Procedures
Once
an
underwriter
has
ascertained
the
type(s)
and
number
of
personal
records
that
a
company 
maintains,
they
are
then
concerned
about
specific
procedures
that
apply
to
such
data.
More
specifically, 
the
insurer
will
favor
an
applicant
that
(1)
has
written
procedures
in
place
that
comply
with
laws 
governing
the
handling
and
disclosure
of
such
information,
and
(2)
requires
service
providers
who
may 
have
access
to
the
applicant’s
company’s
confidential
information
(or
personally
identifiable
information 
(PII)
belonging
to
its
customers)
to
demonstrate
that
they
maintain
adequate
security
policies
and 
procedures. 
Encryption
and
Storage
The
manner
in
which
data
is
stored
has
an
important
bearing
on
an
underwriter’s
assessment
of
an 
applicant.
Specifically,
insurers
want
to
know
(1)
whether
user-specific,
private,
sensitive,
or
confidential 
information
stored
on
the
applicant’s
servers
is
encrypted,
(2)
if
the
applicant
has
a
procedure
for
the 
secure
handling,
care,
and
storage
of
the
private,
sensitive,
and
confidential
information
stored
on
portable 
communications
equipment,
and
if
so,
(3)
what
percentage
of
the
data
maintained
on
portable 
communications
equipment
is
encrypted. 
Data
Sharing
and
Outside
Access
The
underwriter
is
also
interested
in
(1)
the
extent
to
which
and
form
in
which
an
applicant
company 
shares
its
sensitive,
private,
or
personal
information
(that
it
gathers
from
customers)
with
third
parties
and 
service
providers
and,
to
the
extent
the
company
does
collect
such
information,
(2)
whether
the
company 
requires
service
providers/third
parties
to
demonstrate
that
they
employ
adequate
security
procedures. 
Website
and
Content
Information
The
process
of
assessing
the
risks
inherent
in
the
content
provided
by
an
applicant’s
website
requires
an 
underwriter
to
evaluate
a
number
of
areas. 
Website
Type
The
underwriter
begins
by
ascertaining
the
type
of
website
the
company
provides.
The
following
are 
among
the
major
types. 
•
Information-only
(provides
general
information
about
the
applicant’s
products/services)
•
Accessible
(has
login
capabilities
allowing
access
to
secure
or
restricted
content,
such
as
accounts, 
subscriptions,
or
profiles,
and
allows
the
user
to
upload
or
download
secure
data)
52•
Transactional
(accepts
orders
or
purchases
using
credit/debit
cards,
accepts

Companies
operating
“information-only”
websites
will
be
charged
a
lower
rate
than
those
with 
“accessible”
websites,
which,
in
turn,
pay
a
lower
rate
than
do
companies
maintaining
“transactional” 
websites. 
Types
of
Material
Provided
The
type
of
material
provided
on
a
company’s
website
influences
the
premium
it
is
charged
for
coverage. 
The
following
types
of
website
content
are
among
the
most
popular. 
•
Music/sound
clips
•
Forums/message
boards/blogs
•
Executable
programs
•
Movies/movie
clips
•
Advertising
of
others’
products
•
Interactive
gaming/games
of
chance
•
Sweepstakes
or
coupons
•
Sexually
explicit
material
•
Content
specifically
targeted
at
minors
Each
of
these
nine
types
would
likely
carry
a
different
rate. 
Legal
Procedures
Underwriters
seek
applicants
that
have
a
written
intellectual
property
clearance
procedure
for
content 
disseminated
on
their
website.
Such
procedures
should
include
(1)
screening
content
by
a
qualified 
attorney;
(2)
screening
content
for
(a)
disparagement
issues,
(b)
copyright
infringement,
(c)
trademark 
infringement,
and
(d)
invasion
of
privacy;
(3)
obtaining
agreements
with
outside
content
providers
or 
consultants
that
include
provisions
granting
the
applicant
company
ownership
of
the
intellectual
property 
rights
in
any
work
for
hire
supplied
by
the
outside
consultant/provider;
(4)
requiring
employees
and 
independent
contractors
to
sign
a
statement
that
they
will
not
use
previous
employers’
or
clients’
trade 
secrets
or
other
intellectual
property;
(5)
obtaining
the
written
permission
of
any
website
to
which
the 
applicant
company
links
or
frames;
(6)
providing
evidence
of
a
formal
procedure
(a)
to
review
all
content 
prior
to
posting
and
(b)
for
editing
or
removing
controversial,
offensive,
or
infringing
material
from 
material
distributed,
broadcast,
or
published
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
applicant;
(7)
responding
to
allegations 
that
content
created,
displayed,
or
published
by
the
applicant
is
libelous,
infringing,
or
in
violation
of
a 
third
party’s
privacy
rights;
and
(8)
screening
all
trademarks
used
by
the
applicant
for
infringement
with 
existing
trademarks
prior
to
first
use. 
Underwriters
seek
information
about
whether
the
company
collects
any
data
from
children,
and
if
so,
the 
applicant
must
describe
the
method
used
to
secure
parental
permission. 
Extent
of
Contractual
Risk
Transfer
The
extent
to
which
a
client
company
has
obtained
indemnity
agreements
from
the
technology
providers 
with
which
it
has
significant
relationships
should
be
considered
in
pricing
decisions
made
by
an 
underwriter
of
cyber
and
privacy
coverage.
Additionally,
the
fact
that
technology
providers
maintain
an 
insurance
policy
to
cover
the
liabilities
they
have
assumed
is
also
a
factor
that
should
reduce
the
premium 
charged
by
the
underwriter.
This
is
indicated
by
the
example
below. 
An
Example
A
bank
enters
into
an
agreement
with
a
cloud
computing
provider
in
which
the
provider
will
handle
all
of
53the
bank’s
computer
system
and
data
processing
needs.
As
part
of
the
agreement,
the
cloud
computing 
firm
also
assumes
full
responsibility
for
all
loss
that
is
the
result
of
its
sole
negligence.
To
back
this 
assumption
of
liability,
the
provider
agrees
to
maintain
a
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O)
policy 
with
a
$10
million
limit. 
Two
months
after
the
agreement
goes
into
effect,
a
hacker
gains
access
to
the
bank’s
systems
and 
transfers
$5
million
from
the
bank
to
an
account
in
the
Cayman
Islands.
A
post-loss
forensic
expert’s 
investigation
reveals
that
the
breach
was
the
result
of
a
fully
preventable
vulnerability
in
the
cloud 
provider’s
system.
In
other
words,
the
loss
was
caused
by
the
provider’s
negligence. 
Accordingly,
the
bank
will,
in
theory
at
least,
be
able
to
obtain
indemnification
from
the
cloud
provider’s 
insurance
policy
rather
than
its
own
cyber
and
privacy
insurer.
Alternatively,
the
bank’s
cyber
and 
privacy
insurer
will
be
able
to
subrogate
against
the
cloud
provider
after
it
pays
the
$5
million
loss
to
the 
bank.
Either
way,
the
cloud
provider’s
liability
assumption,
coupled
with
the
existence
of
a
technology 
E&O
policy,
vastly
reduces
the
cyber
and
privacy
underwriter’s
exposure
to
loss. 
Loss
History
Prior
claim
history
is
a
key
element
in
evaluating
an
applicant
for
cyber
and
privacy
liability.
In
addition 
to
charging
a
higher-than-usual
premium
as
a
result
of
a
poor
claim
record,
insurers
also
sometimes 
impose
larger-than-normal
retentions
on
a
company
that
seeks
coverage
under
these
circumstances.
In
a 
hard
market,
insureds
with
a
subpar
cyber-loss
history
may
even
face
nonrenewals
and
have
trouble 
finding
coverage
at
all
(or
at
least
not
at
a
premium
they
deem
to
be
affordable). 
Frequency
Matters
More
than
Severity
However,
underwriters
are
typically
more
concerned
about
frequency
than
severity.
A
frequency
problem 
is
more
indicative
of
a
poor
risk
than
is
a
single
major
claim
in
which
unusual
circumstances,
rather
than 
gross
negligence,
produced
a
high-dollar
loss.
And
after
such
a
loss,
underwriters
are
especially
interested 
in
learning
the
nature
of
the
protective
measures
that
a
company
has
taken
to
prevent
future
occurrences 
of
a
similar
nature. 
Details
of
Prior
Losses
Underwriters
want
to
know
if
an
applicant
has
had
any
claims,
incidents,
or
reports
of
circumstances 
involving
the
following. 
•
Unauthorized
access
to
confidential
information,
failing
to
notify
appropriate
individuals
of
any 
such
unauthorized
access,
or
failing
to
allow
authorized
users
access
to
the
applicant’s
computer 
systems
•
Dissemination
of
content
on
or
via
the
applicant’s
websites
or
company
email
that
infringed
on 
the
intellectual
property
rights
of
another
party
or
caused
harm
to
the
reputation
of
another
party
•
Extortion
attempts
or
demands
involving
its
computer
systems,
or
suffering
a
loss
of
money, 
securities,
or
other
property
due
to
fraud
committed
by
means
of
unauthorized
access
to
or 
fraudulent
entry
into
computer
instructions
or
code,
by
someone
other
than
an
employee
•
Intrusions,
such
as
unauthorized
access,
security
breach,
and
denial
of
service
attacks,
that 
impaired
the
functionality
of
its
computer
systems
•
Circumstances
or
incidents
that
have
not
yet
given,
but
could
potentially
give,
rise
to
a
claim 
against
the
applicant
under
the
insurance
policy
for
which
the
applicant
is
applying
(Of
course,
any 
known
incidents
of
this
kind
will
not
be
covered
by
a
policy
issued
to
the
applicant.)
Summary
Underwriting
cyber
and
privacy
coverage
is
a
challenging
endeavor
since
it
encompasses
both
property 
and
liability
coverages,
the
need
to
work
with
limited
historical
loss
data,
and
new,
emerging
sources
of 
loss. 
54In
developing
rates
for
cyber
and
privacy
policies,
underwriters
begin
by
grouping
a
risk
into
a
broad 
hazard
class.
Then,
within
that
class,
they
apply
a
specific
rate
for
each
of
the
individual
insuring 
agreements
selected
by
the
insured.
Finally,
a
separate
rate
is
applied
to
the
policy’s
annual
aggregate 
limit. 
The
last
step
of
the
underwriting
process
involves
modifying
these
basic
rates,
according
to
the
following 
factors
particular
to
the
risk. 
•
Network
security
measures
•
Personnel,
policies,
and
procedures
•
Information
security
•
Website
and
content
information
•
Extent
of
contractual
risk
transfer
•

Overview
This
chapter
will
provide
an
overview
of
the
most
common
insuring
agreements
found
within
cyber
and 
privacy
insurance
policy
forms.
In
addition,
this
chapter
analyzes
the
insuring
agreement
covering
privacy 
notification
and
crisis
management
expenses. 
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Identify
the
13
types
of
insuring
agreements
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms
and 
classify
them
into
one
of
four
coverage
categories.
•
Recognize
the
major
coverage
components
found
within
the
insuring
agreement
providing
privacy 
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
coverage.
•
Recognize
loss
scenarios
in
which
the
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
insuring 
agreement
would
apply.
•
Recognize
why
the
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
insuring
agreement
is
often 
considered
the
single
most
important
insuring
agreement
contained
within
cyber
and
privacy 
policies.
56The
13
Types
of
Insuring
Agreements
within
Cyber
and
Privacy 
Policies
There
are
13
different
insuring
agreements
typically
contained
within
cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms, 
which
appear
in
the
following
chart..
These
insuring
agreements
will
be
analyzed
in
subsequent
chapters 
of
this
course.

Use
a
“Menu”
Approach
It
should
also
be
recognized
that
few
insurers
offer
all
13
of
these
insuring
agreements
within
their
policy 
forms.
For
example,
many
insurers
do
not
offer
any
of
the
first-party
time
element
or
first-party
theft
of 
property
insuring
agreements.
(This
is
because
they
consider
cyber
and
privacy
policies
to
function
solely 
as
third-party
liability
insurance
and
as
coverage
for
response
to
a
data
breach,
rather
than
a
type
of 
insurance
to
cover
property.) 
When
purchasing
cyber
and
privacy
policies,
an
insured
has
the
opportunity
to
buy
any
number
of 
insuring
agreements,
depending
upon
which
of
these
insuring
agreements
a
specific
insurer
offers.
For 
example,
referring
to
Exhibit
8.1,
Insurer
X’s
policy
may
only
include
insuring
agreement
numbers
1,
2, 
3,
7,
9,
and
10.
From
this
list,
an
insured
could
then
conceivably
buy
any
number
of
these
insuring 
agreements. 
Categories
of
Insuring
Agreements
It
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
these
13
insuring
agreements
can
be
classified
within
one
of
four 
categories. 
•
First-Party/Post
Breach
Response
Coverage
•
Third-Party/Liability
Coverages
•
First-Party/Time
Element
Coverages
•
First-Party/Theft
of
Property
Coverages
Additionally,
each
of
the
13
insuring
agreements
contains
the
following. 
•
A
separate
per-claim
limit
58•
A
separate
per-claim
deductible
Lastly,
cyber
and
privacy
policies
are
written
with
an
annual
aggregate
limit
of
coverage.
This
annual 
aggregate
is
the
most
that
an
insurer
will
pay
in
overall
losses
sustained
during
a
policy
period.
Generally, 
the
annual
aggregate
limit
is
the
total
of
the
per-claim
limits
for
all
of
the
individual
insuring
agreements 
that
an
insured
has
purchased. 
59The
13
Insuring
Agreements:
Complications
and
Caveats
As
already
explained,
few,
if
any,
of
the
insurers
in
today’s
market
write
policies
that
contain
all
13 
insuring
agreements.
Rather,
the
typical
policy
contains
roughly
five
to
eight
insuring
agreements. 
In
fact,
coverage
for
cyber-related
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
is
available
by
buying
an
entirely 
separate
policy
form. 
Cyber
and
Privacy
Policies:
The
Essence
of
Nonstandard
Coverage
At
this
juncture,
it
should
be
apparent
that
there
is
no
standard
cyber
and
privacy
policy—a
fact
that 
makes
them
exceedingly
difficult
to
compare
on
a
side-by-side
basis. 
Identical
Coverage,
Varying
Terminology
To
complicate
matters
even
further,
different
insurers
use
different
terminology
to
identify
what
are 
essentially
the
same
insuring
agreements.
For
example,
one
insurer
uses
the
term
“E-Threat
Coverage”
to 
identify
the
insuring
agreement
covering
situations
in
which
an
insured’s
computer
network
is
threatened 
with
severe
damage
unless
a
ransom
is
paid.
Another
insurer,
offering
virtually
identical
coverage,
uses 
the
name
“Cyber
Extortion
Coverage”
to
designate
this
kind
of
insurance.
While
this
may
happen
to
some 
degree
across
other
lines
of
insurance,
cyber-related
terminology
has
a
tendency
to
be
more
unclear
about 
what
exactly
is
being
covered. 
Combining
Insuring
Agreements
Even
more
confusing
is
the
fact
that
some
insurers
combine
coverage
found
within
one
or
more
of
these 
13
insuring
agreements
into
a
single
insuring
agreement.
For
example,
a
handful
of
insurers
write
policies 
that
combine
coverage
for
both
regulatory
defense
and
penalties
(insuring
agreement
3
in
Exhibit
8.1) 
with
the
coverage
provided
by
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
(insuring
agreement
1 
in
Exhibit
8.1)
within
one
insuring
agreement. 
Splitting
Up
Insuring
Agreements
Yet
again,
certain
insurers
offer
singular
coverage
elements
that
are
almost
always
combined
with
other 
coverages
elsewhere.
Case-in-point,
normally,
crisis
management
expense
coverage
(i.e.,
the
cost
of 
hiring
a
public
relations
firm
following
a
data
breach)
is
one
of
the
coverage
elements
found
within
the 
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
insuring
agreement.
Despite
this,
several
insurers 
provide
crisis
management
expense
coverage
as
an
entirely
separate
insuring
agreement. 
60Privacy
Notification
and
Crisis
Management
Expense
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
the
direct
expenses
required
to
respond
to
a
data
breach
immediately
after 
it
occurs.
Accordingly,
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
coverage
functions
as
the 
“loss
containment”
or
“loss
minimization”
element
of
a
policy.
The
specific
items
it
covers
include,
but 
are
not
necessarily
limited
to,
the
following
costs. 
•
Computer
Forensics.
Hire
a
computer
forensics
expert
to
suggest
measures
that
will
(1)
secure
the 
insured’s
information
system
immediately
following
a
breach,
(2)
determine
the
cause
of
the 
breach,
and
(3)
offer
advice
on
how
to
prevent
future
breaches,
items
collectively
referred
to
as 
“remediation.”
•
Public
Relations
and
Crisis
Management
Assistance.
Engage
a
public
relations
firm
to
guide
the 
insured
during
the
early
days
following
the
breach
and
assist
in
communicating
with
the
public 
about
the
breach.
•
Call
Center.
Set
up
and
provide
access
to
a
post-breach
call
center,
allowing
customers
to
receive 
up-to-the-minute
details
about
the
breach
and
learn
how
their
PII
may
have
been
affected
by
it.
•
Notification.
Notify
affected
customers
that
their
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
has 
been
compromised,
a
need
driven
largely
by
the
applicable,
state-specific
notification 
requirements,
which
is,
in
turn,
a
function
of
the
state
in
which
the
customer
resides
rather
than
the 
location
of
the
insured’s
business.
•
Credit
Monitoring.
Monitor
affected
customers’
credit
(usually
for
1
year).
•
Identity
Theft
Monitoring.
Provide
identity
theft
monitoring,
a
service
that
is
even
more 
comprehensive
than
credit
monitoring.
The
latter
only
detects
situations
where
a
“bad
actor” 
attempts
to
open
new
or
use
existing
credit
lines,
whereas
identity
theft
monitoring
can
detect 
additional
fraudulent
uses
of
PII.
•
Bank
Notification.
Notify
banks
and
credit
card
companies
whose
credit
card
numbers
have
been 
compromised.
Privacy
Notification
and
Crisis
Management
Expense
Coverage:
The
Single
Most 
Important
Insuring
Agreement
Industry
observers
have
often
asserted
that
the
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense 
insuring
agreement
is
the
single
most
important
insuring
agreement
found
within
a
cyber
and
privacy 
policy.
This
is
because
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
coverage
provides
an
insured
with 
access
to
insurer’s
expertise
in
the
hours/days
immediately
following
the
discovery
of
a
data
breach, 
which
is
termed
“breach
coaching.” 
Because
few
insureds
have
the
know-how
to
deal
with
the
complexities
of
a
data
breach,
an
insurer’s
61assistance
is
especially
valuable
during
this
critical
period
of
time.
The
more
efficiently
and
effectively
a 
company’s
immediate
response
to
a
data
breach
is,
the
lower
its
overall
loss
will
be.
Usually,
if
the 
immediate
response
to
a
data
breach
is
handled
well,
such
actions
will
minimize
the
company’s
business 
interruption
loss,
loss
of
critical
data,
and
the
extent
of
its
ultimate
liability
to
its
customers
for
the
breach 
of
their
PII.
For
these
reasons,
the
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
insuring
agreement
is
often 
considered
the
single
most
important
coverage
contained
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies. 
Claim
Scenario
To
place
the
magnitude
of
the
costs
covered
by
the
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
insuring 
agreement
in
perspective,
a
large
retailer
reported
that
it
incurred
$28
million
in
breach
response
costs 
(such
as
forensics,
public
relations,
notification
of
customers/banks,
and
credit/identity
monitoring)
as
a 
result
of
the
data
breach
suffered
by
the
company.

coverage
Chapter
Objectives
This
chapter
discusses
the
four
major
types
of
third-party
liability
loss
exposures.
On
completion
of
this 
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Recognize
the
nature
of
the
insuring
agreement
commonly
used
to
cover
each
exposure.
•
Identify
the
manner
in
which
the
insuring
agreement
applies
to
given
claims
scenarios.
•
Recognize
the
key
coverage
limitations
and
extensions
associated
with
each
of
these
insuring 
agreements.
63Information
Security
and
Privacy
Liability
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
the
insured’s
liability
for
the
following. 
•
Failure
to
prevent
the
loss,
theft,
or
unauthorized
disclosure
of
personally
identifiable
information 
(PII)
that
is
(a)
in
its
own
care,
custody,
or
control
or
(b)
is
in
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
a 
third
party
for
which
the
insured
is
responsible.
An
example
of
the
latter
instance
could
involve
a 
corporate
wellness
plan
vendor
that
collects
the
data
produced
by
annual
employee
health 
screenings.
If
such
data
were
to
be
breached,
the
information
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring 
agreement
would
cover
an
insured
corporation’s
vicarious
liability
for
the
negligence
of
the 
wellness
plan
vendor
in
allowing
the
data
to
be
accessed.
•
Failure
to
prevent
(a)
damage
to
data
stored
on
the
insured’s
computer
systems,
(b)
the 
transmission
of
malicious
code
from
the
insured’s
computer
to
a
third
party’s
computer,
or
(c)
the 
denial
of
service
to
a
third
party’s
computer
system.
•
Failure
to
timely
disclose
a
data
breach
incident
in
violation
of
any
breach
notification
law.
•
Failure
to
comply
with
its
own
privacy
policy
that
prohibits
or
restricts
(a)
the
disclosure,
sharing, 
or
selling
of
a
person’s
personally
identifiable
nonpublic
information,
(b)
failure
to
correct 
incomplete
or
inaccurate
personally
identifiable
nonpublic
information
after
a
request
is
made
by
a 
person,
or
(c)
failure
to
prevent
the
loss
of
personally
identifiable
nonpublic
information.
•
Failure
to
administer
an
identity
theft
prevention
program
required
by
governmental
statute
or 
regulation
or
failure
to
take
necessary
actions
to
prevent
identity
theft,
including
phishing.
The
key
point
to
recognize
with
regard
to
the
information
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring 
agreement
is
that
it
applies
only
when
the
legal
liability
of
the
insured
is
either
established
by
a
court
of 
law
or
to
pay
on
behalf
of
an
insured
business
that
has
entered
into
a
settlement
with
a
claimant.
This
is
in 
contrast
to
the
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
insuring
agreement
(discussed
previously
in 
Chapter
8),
which
makes
payments
to
claimants
on
a
voluntary
basis
(i.e.,
prior
to
receiving
a
legal 
demand)
for
items
such
as
credit
and
identity
monitoring.
In
effect,
coverage
under
the
information 
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring
agreements
is
driven
by
the
insured’s
legal
liability
rather
than
by 
the
insured’s
voluntary
actions. 
Claim
Scenario
A
hacker
gains
access
to
a
retailer’s
computer
system.
As
a
result,
she
obtains
the
names,
addresses, 
Social
Security
numbers,
and
driver’s
license
numbers
(all
of
which
constitute
PII)
belonging
to
100,000 
of
the
company’s
customers.
After
the
breach
becomes
public
knowledge,
a
class
action
lawsuit
is 
brought
against
the
retailer
by
a
number
of
the
customers
whose
PII
was
obtained
by
the
hacker.
In
this 
situation,
the
information
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring
agreement
will
provide
coverage
for
64actual
damages
incurred
by
the
customers
(e.g.,
their
PII
is
used
for
identity
theft,
which
the
thief
uses
to 
empty
the
customers’
bank
accounts).
If
the
retailer
is
found
legally
liable
for
the
breach
and
must
pay
a 
settlement
or
judgment
to
the
plaintiffs
(as
well
as
the
costs
incurred
in
defending
the
claim),
this
insuring 
agreement
will
cover
these
items. 
“Intrusion”
but
No
Theft
of
Data:
Does
Coverage
Apply?
A
few
insurers’
information
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring
agreements
provide
coverage
only 
when
there
is
an
actual
theft
of
data,
such
as
in
a
Target-type
data
breach
(i.e.,
when
credit
and
debit
card 
numbers
were
stolen).
On
the
other
hand,
such
policies
do
not
afford
coverage
when
there
is
a
mere 
“intrusion”
with
no
actual
theft. 
Two
examples
of
intrusions
that
do
not
involve
theft
include
(a)
the
introduction
of
a
virus
into
a 
computer
system
(with
the
intention
of
damaging
or
corrupting
data
stored
within
the
system)
and
(b)
a 
“spam”
attack
(in
which
a
computer
system
is
intentionally
flooded
with
a
massive
number
of
emails 
intending
to
“crash”
the
system
and
shut
it
down). 
In
both
cases,
an
insured’s
website
could
cease
to
function,
producing
various
kinds
of
losses,
such
as
a 
denial
of
service
to
subscribers
to
an
online
data
service,
yet
without
the
actual
theft
of
data. 
From
an
insured’s
standpoint,
it
is,
of
course,
preferable
if
the
scope
of
coverage
under
the
Information 
Security
and
Privacy
Liability
insuring
agreement
also
includes
loss
resulting
not
only
from
theft,
but
also 
from
electronic
“intrusions”
and
“disruptions,”
such
as
those
sustained
in
these
last
two
examples. 
65Regulatory
Defense
and
Penalties
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
the
costs
of
dealing
with
regulators
who
oversee
state
and
federal
data 
breach
laws,
as
well
as
laws
governing
protected,
personal
health
data,
such
as
the
Health
Insurance 
Portability
and
Accountability
Act
(HIPAA). 
The
two
key
components
of
this
insuring
agreement
include
(1)
coverage
for
the
costs
of
the
legal
defense 
required
by
regulatory
actions
and
(2)
payment
of
the
fines
and
penalties
that
may
be
levied
against
an 
insured
by
various
regulators. 
Dealing
with
Multiple
Regulatory
Agencies:
An
Insured’s
Worst
Nightmare
Regulatory
defense
and
penalties
coverage
is
especially
valuable
because
a
data
breach
normally
involves 
having
to
deal
with
multiple
sets
of
regulators.
This
is
because,
at
the
time
of
writing,
47
of
the
50
states 
have
their
own
separate
laws
enumerating
a
business’s
obligations
to
its
customers
and
the
general
public 
immediately
following
a
data
breach. 
Recognize,
too,
that
state
regulatory
authorities
become
involved
in
a
data
breach
whenever
residents
of 
their
state
are
affected.
Thus,
a
business
located
in
a
given
state
will
not
merely
be
compelled
to
deal
with 
regulators
in
the
company’s
principal
state
of
business.
In
addition,
the
company
will
be
required
to
report 
the
breach
to
state
regulators
in
every
state
where
its
customers
are
located—a
fact
that
vastly
increases 
the
number
of
state
regulatory
authorities,
which
a
business
must
deal
with
after
a
major
data
breach. 
In
addition
to
state
regulators,
there
are
a
number
of
federal
regulatory
agencies
that
oversee
data 
breaches,
including
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
(FTC),
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission 
(SEC),
and
the
Department
of
Justice
(DOJ). 
By
purchasing
the
regulatory
defense
and
penalties
insuring
agreement,
an
insured
will
benefit
from
its 
insurer’s
network
of
regulatory-savvy
defense
attorneys. 
Affirmative
Coverage
for
Fines
and
Penalties
It
is
also
important
to
point
out
that
the
regulatory
defense
and
penalties
insuring
agreement
provides
one 
of
the
few
types
of
insurance
that
affirmatively
covers
fines
and
penalties;
items
otherwise
considered 
uninsurable
(and
thus
excluded)
under
most
other
kinds
of
insurance
coverage.
(Note
that
some
insurers’ 
policies
offer
coverage
for
fines
and
penalties,
but
only
by
endorsement,
and
for
an
additional
premium.) 
Claim
Scenario
As
an
example
of
how
costly
data
breach-related
fines
and
penalties
can
be,
one
company
agreed
to
pay
a 
$25
million
penalty
to
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC)
for
having
exposed
the
PII
of 
280,000
of
its
customers.
These
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
costs
that
are
commonly
covered
under
the 
Regulatory
Defense
and
Penalties
insuring
agreement. 
Payment
Card
Industry
Fines
and
Assessments
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
fines
and
penalties
assessed
against
the
insured
(although
only
to
the 
extent
that
such
fines
and
penalties
are
insurable
by
law)
incurred
in
conjunction
with
a
claim
made 
against
the
insured
by
a
credit
card
company,
alleging
that
the
insured
did
not
comply
with
payment
card 
industry
data
security
standards.
Such
claims
most
often
arise
in
response
to
a
wrongful
act
covered
under
66a
cyber
and
privacy
policy’s
information
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring
agreement
(discussed
in 
detail
above). 
Payment
Card
Industry
Data
Security
Standards
Payment
card
industry
data
security
standards
are
a
set
of
proprietary
information
security
standards
for 
businesses
that
accept
payment
from
the
leading
credit
cards,
including
Visa,
MasterCard,
American 
Express,
and
Discover.
Payment
card
industry
fines
and
assessments
coverage
is
offered
by
a
minority
of 
insurers,
although
its
presence
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies
has
been
increasing. 
Affirmative
Coverage
of
Fines
and
Penalties
Just
as
the
regulatory
defense
and
penalties
insuring
agreement
affirmatively
covers
fines
and
penalties, 
so
too
does
the
payment
card
industry
fines
and
assessments
insuring
agreement.
Once
again,
this 
insuring
agreement
is
one
of
the
few
types
of
insurance
that
affirmatively
covers
fines
and
penalties; 
items
otherwise
considered
uninsurable
(and
thus
excluded)
under
most
other
kinds
of
insurance 
coverage. 
Insuring
Agreement
also
Covers
Defense
This
insuring
agreement
also
covers
the
cost
of
defending
the
insured
if
the
insured
believes
that
it
did
not 
violate
industry
standards
and
that
the
loss
suffered
by
the
credit
card
issuer
was
not
the
result
of
a
failure 
to
follow
such
standards. 
Claim
Scenario
A
merchant
processes
a
$5,000
transaction
that
used
a
fraudulent
credit
card.
(The
card
had
been
stolen 
and
then
used
by
the
thief
to
make
purchases.)
As
a
result
of
having
accepted
the
stolen
card,
the 
merchant
is
fined
for
having
violated
payment
card
industry
standards.
The
payment
card
industry
fines 
and
assessments
insuring
agreement
will
cover
the
fine
as
well
as
the
defense
costs
that
the
merchant 
incurs
if
the
merchant
decides
to
challenge
the
imposition
of
the
fines
(because
she
believes
she
followed 
applicable
standards
when
processing
the
transaction). 
67Website
Media
Content
Liability
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
affords
coverage
when
the
insured
incurs
liability
in
conjunction
with
material 
published
on
its
website.
More
specifically,
it
covers
claims
alleging
four
broad
types
of
claim 
allegations. 
•
Personal
injury,
such
as
defamation,
libel,
slander,
trade
libel,
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
and 
invasion
of
privacy,
including
an
invasion
or
interference
with
an
individual’s
right
of
publicity
•
Commercial/intellectual
property
violations,
including
plagiarism;
piracy;
misappropriation
of 
ideas
under
implied
contract;
copyright
infringement;
and
infringement
of
domain
name, 
trademark,
trade
name,
trade
dress,
logo,
title,
meta-tag,
slogan,
service
mark,
or
service
name
•
Other
improper
Web-based
activities,
including
improper
deep
linking
or
framing
within 
electronic
content
•
Social
media
liability
resulting
from
activities
engaged
in
on
sites
such
as
Facebook,
LinkedIn, 
Twitter,
Snapchat,
and
others
Claim
Scenarios
The
following
claim
scenarios
illustrate
potential
claims
in
each
of
the
aforementioned
four
categories. 
Personal
Injury
A
health
insurance
company
accidentally
posts
to
its
website
private
medical
information
about
several 
patients
without
first
obtaining
a
release
from
the
patients.
This
would
constitute
an
invasion
of
privacy, 
which
is
a
type
of
personal
injury. 
Commercial/Intellectual
Property
Violations
An
online
retailer’s
website
incorporates
a
photo
from
a
commercial
photographer.
The
commercial 
photographer
brings
a
lawsuit
against
the
retailer
alleging
copyright
infringement
on
the
basis
that
the 
retailer
failed
to
license
the
material. 
Other
Improper
Web-Based
Activities
A
publishing
firm
provides
information
on
human
resources
policies
and
procedures
to
its
customers.
Its 
online
material
contains
a
number
of
links
to
a
human
resources
consulting
firm’s
website.
The
consulting 
firm
sues
the
publishing
firm,
alleging
that
the
links
violate
the
consulting
firm’s
intellectual
property 
rights
because
the
links
enhance
the
publishing
firm’s
website
without
providing
compensation
to
the 
consulting
firm.
(This
is
known
as
“improper
deep-linking.”) 
Social
Media
Liability
The
president
of
a
company
posts
a
business-related
“how
to”
article
on
LinkedIn
that
is
virtually 
identical
to
an
article
published
a
year
earlier
by
another
author.
The
author
brings
a
claim
of
plagiarism
68against
the
company
president. 
Website
Media
Content
Liability
Coverage:
Does
Not
Respond
to
Data
Breaches
One
oddity
concerning
the
website
media
content
liability
insuring
agreement
is
that
unlike
the
other
12 
insuring
agreements
discussed
in
this
course,
it
is
the
only
one
that
covers
losses
caused
neither
by
data 
breaches
nor
by
electronic
intrusions. 
Consider
Buying
a
“Traditional”
Media
Liability
Policy
That
Covers
Website
and 
Social
Media
Activities
In
reality,
the
website
media
content
liability
insuring
agreement
functions
much
like
a
“traditional,” 
stand-alone
media
liability
policy,
but
with
one
key
difference—it
only
covers
media-type
liability 
incurred
from
website
activities.
As
a
result,
the
website
media
content
liability
insuring
agreement’s 
main
drawback
is
that
it
provides
no
coverage
for
nonwebsite
media
activities
(e.g.,
paper
publishing, 
broadcast
media,
public
appearances).
For
this
reason,
it
may
be
more
advantageous
for
an
insured
to 
simply
buy
a
traditional,
comprehensive
media
liability
policy
that
also
includes
coverage
for
liability 
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
company’s
website
activities. 
Only
about
half
of
all
cyber
and
privacy
insurers
offer
website
media
content
liability
coverage. 
Cyber-Related
Bodily
Injury
and
Property
Damage
Liability
Coverage
Coverage
for
cyber-related
bodily
injury
(BI)
and
property
damage
(PD)
liability
is
necessary
because
(as 
will
be
discussed
in
Chapter
13
of
this
course)
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
universally
exclude 
coverage
for
direct
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
liability
caused
by
cyber
intrusions. 
An
Example
A
hospital's
computer
system
is
breached,
causing
it
to
shut
down.
As
a
result,
for
8
hours,
the
hospital
is 
unable
to
remotely
monitor
the
patients
in
its
cardiac
unit.
During
this
period
of
time,
three
patients
suffer 
fatal
heart
attacks
because
changes
in
their
conditions
could
not
be
ascertained,
and
thus,
they
were
not 
given
immediate,
necessary
treatments.
Lawsuits
are
later
brought
by
the
patients’
estates
against
the 
hospital,
alleging
that
the
hospital's
negligence
in
failing
to
prevent
the
intrusion
into
its
computer
system 
caused
the
patients'
injuries. 
Although
there
is
no
coverage
for
cyber-induced
BI
and
PD
liability
within
cyber
and
privacy
policy 
forms
(given
the
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
liability
exclusion
noted
earlier),
the
hospital
would 
have
coverage
for
claims
of
this
nature
under
its
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
and
umbrella 
liability
policies.
This
is
because
such
forms
affirmatively
cover
liability
for
bodily
injury
and
contain
no 
exclusions
for
cyber-induced
claims
of
this
type. 
Why
Is
Coverage
for
Cyber-Related
Bodily
Injury
and
Property
Damage
Liability 
Necessary?
So
why,
then,
is
coverage
for
cyber-related
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
liability
even
necessary? 
There
are
two
reasons,
which
are
explained
below. 
First,
it
is
very
possible
that
in
the
future,
CGL
policy
forms
may
begin
to
exclude
coverage
for
bodily 
injury
and
property
damage
liability
claims
arising
from
cyber
incidents.
Or
even
if
standard
CGL 
wording
continues
to
cover
cyber-related
BI
and
PD
liability,
underwriters
may
selectively
add 
exclusionary
wording
to
policies,
especially
those
covering
high-severity
risks,
such
as
those
involving 
construction,
healthcare,
and
energy-related
businesses. 
Second,
even
if
a
CGL
form
does
not
exclude
such
coverage,
in
a
catastrophic
claim
situation
(as
in
the 
hospital
example
above),
typical
$1–$5
million
CGL
policy
limits
(even
when
augmented
by
an
umbrella 
policy)
may
not
provide
adequate
coverage. 
Cyber-Related
Bodily
Injury
and
Property
Damage
Liability
Coverage
Details
In
April
2014,
AIG
introduced
a
policy
form,
known
as
CyberEdge
PC,
which
provides
coverage
for
69cyber-related
BI
liability
and
PD
liability.
(A
handful
of
other
insurers
have
introduced
similar
policy 
forms
covering
cyber-related
BI
and
PD-related
liability,
and
it
is
expected
that
additional
carriers
will
do 
likewise
in
the
near
future.) 
Yet
another
important
feature
of
the
AIG
policy
is
that
it
applies
on
both
(1)
an
excess
and
(2)
a 
difference-in-conditions
(DIC)
basis.
This
means
that
first,
the
policy
does
not
pay
until
underlying 
applicable
policy
limits
(i.e.,
as
afforded
by
CGL
and/or
umbrella
policies)
are
exhausted.
Second,
the 
DIC
coverage
aspect
means
that
the
policy
will
“drop
down”
and,
thus,
provide
coverage
in
the
event
that 
the
underlying
CGL
and/or
umbrella
policies
contain
cyber-related
BI
and/or
PD-related
cyber
exclusions 
or
other
coverage
restrictions. 
Summary
This
chapter
examined
the
insuring
agreements
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies,
written
to
cover 
four
specific
types
of
third-party
liability
exposures. 
1.
Information
security
and
privacy
liability
2.
Regulatory
defense
and
penalties
3.
Payment
card
industry
fines
and
assessments
4.
Website
media
content
liability
5.
Cyber-related
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
liability
Each
exposure
is
addressed
by
a
separate
insuring
agreement
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
liability 
policies.

Cyber
and
Privacy
Insurance:
First-Party 
Time
Element
Insuring
Agreements
Overview
The
two
major
types
of
first-party
time
element
insuring
agreements
include
the
following. 
•
Business
interruption
•
Extra
expense
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Identify
the
insuring
agreement
commonly
used
to
cover
first-party
property
time
element
loss 
exposures.
•
Recognize
the
manner
in
which
the
insuring
agreement
applies
to
a
given
claims
scenario.
•
Recognize
the
key
coverage
limitations
and
extensions
associated
with
each
of
these
insuring 
agreements.
Cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
provide
two
types
of
time
element
insuring
agreements
:
business 
interruption
(BI)
and
extra
expense
(EE)
. 
It
is
important
to
recognize,
however,
that
many
insurers
do
not
offer
time
element
coverages.
This
is 
because,
philosophically,
they
view
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
as
a
liability/third-party
coverage
and
as 
a
means
of
providing
breach
response
cost
coverage
rather
than
first-party/property-type
insurance.
Other 
underwriters
offer
time
element
coverages,
but
by
endorsement
and
not
within
their
standard
policy 
forms. 
Business
Interruption
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
the
insured’s
“business
interruption
loss”
sustained
during
the
“period
of 
recovery”
(or
the
“extended
interruption
period”)
that
results
from
a
“material
interruption”
caused
by
a 
“computer
system
disruption.”
A
BI
loss
occurs
when
an
insured
sustains
a
loss
of
income
if,
for 
example,
its
order-taking
system
is
unable
to
function
because
of
a
virus
attack. 
How
the
Policies
Define
“Business
Interruption
Loss”
BI
loss
is
defined
as
the
sum
of
the
following. 
71•
Net
profit
before
income
taxes
that
an
insured
sustains
as
a
result
of
a
service
interruption
•
Operating
expenses
that
continue,
despite
the
interruption
(e.g.,
salaries,
rent).
Dependent
Business
Interruption
Coverage
Some,
but
not
all,
insurers’
BI
insuring
agreements
include
dependent
business
interruption
coverage. 
Dependent
business
interruption
coverage
differs
from
“standard”
business
interruption
coverage,
in
that 
the
latter
applies
when
an
insured’s
computer
system
is
unable
to
operate
and,
as
a
consequence,
the 
insured
suffers
a
loss
of
revenue.
In
contrast,
dependent
business
interruption
coverage
is
triggered
when 
the
computer
system
operated
by
a
technology
provider
(who
supplies
services
to
the
insured)
cannot 
operate,
and
as
a
result,
the
insured
sustains
a
revenue
loss. 
For
example,
assume
a
retailer
outsources
its
order-taking
function
by
hiring
a
technology
company
to 
host
its
website.
In
the
event
the
service
provider’s
computer
system
cannot
operate
because
of
a 
malicious
virus,
the
retailer
will
be
unable
to
process
orders
during
the
period
of
outage
and,
therefore, 
suffers
a
loss
of
revenue.
Subject
to
the
retailer’s
policy’s
limit
available
under
its
business
interruption 
insuring
agreement
and
the
applicable
deductible
(a
concept
discussed
later
in
this
chapter),
the
insurer 
will
indemnify
the
retailer
for
its
“business
interruption
loss”
during
the
period
of
time
in
which
the 
technology
service
provider’s
computer
system
is
unable
to
function. 
Business
Interruption
Coverage
Applies
to
Profits—Not
Sales
The
business
interruption
insuring
agreement
applies
to
net
profits
rather
than
net
sales
.
Thus,
if
a 
computer
disruption
caused
a
business
to
lose
$500,000
in
sales,
the
covered
loss
would
be
the
extent
of 
the
actual
profit
lost
on
$500,000
rather
than
on
the
full
$500,000
in
lost
sales. 
Extra
Expense
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
pays
the
additional
costs
expended
to
expedite
repairs
to
an
online
system
so
as 
to
minimize
downtime.
Such
costs
may
include
overtime
labor
expenses,
the
cost
of
hiring
special 
computer
experts,
or
the
cost
for
express
shipping
of
computer
parts. 
Extra
Expense
Coverage
Applies
Only
to
the
Extent
the
Expenditure
Reduces 
Loss
Under
some
policies,
extra
expense
coverage
applies
only
to
the
extent
the
extra
expense
actually
reduces 
the
loss
(i.e.,
hastens
a
firm’s
return
to
operations).
For
example,
assume
an
insured
expends
$50,000
to 
expedite
return
to
full
operations,
but
the
expenditure
only
reduces
the
loss
by
$25,000.
Under
such 
policies,
only
$25,000
will
be
covered. 
In
contrast,
under
other
underwriters’
versions
of
this
insuring
agreement,
the
insurer
will
cover
the
extra 
expenses
incurred,
even
if
they
do
not
actually
expedite
an
insured’s
return
to
full
operating
capacity. 
Thus,
in
the
above
example,
the
full
$50,000
expenditure
would
be
covered. 
Coverage
Limitations
There
are
several
coverage
limitations
associated
with
cyber
policy
time
element
coverages. 
•
Some
policies
do
not
cover
losses
unless
they
involve
theft
of
data.
•
Coverage
applies
only
to
a
failure
of
security,
but
not
to
computer
malfunctions.
•
The
policies
do
not
cover
time
element
losses
caused
by
“traditional”
physical
damage
perils.
“Intrusion”
but
No
Theft
of
Data:
Does
Coverage
Apply?
Under
some
polices,
and
as
is
also
the
case
with
the
four
liability
insuring
agreements
already
discussed, 
for
coverage
to
apply
under
time
element
insuring
agreements,
an
“electronic
disruption”
must
involve
a 
theft
of
data.
Yet,
under
other,
broader
forms,
an
actual
theft
is
not
required.
For
example,
under
such
72policies,
if
an
insured’s
website
is
rendered
inoperable
by
a
spam
attack
or
by
the
introduction
of
a
virus
, 
a
resulting
BI/EE
loss
would
still
be
covered. 
Coverage
Limited
to
Failure
of
Security—Not
Computer
Malfunction
Coverage
is
generally
limited
to
a
failure
of
computer
security
(e.g.,
virus
transmission
by
a
hacker
or
loss 
caused
by
a
theft
of
data)
and
does
not
normally
extend
to
a
simple
malfunction
or
failure
not
related
to
a 
security
failure.
Thus,
a
failure
due
to
the
fact
that
a
computer
part
simply
wore
out,
causing
a 
malfunction
and
consequent
shut
down
of
a
company’s
computer
system,
would
not
be
covered. 
No
Coverage
for
Loss
Caused
by
“Traditional’
Physical
Damage
Another
important
limitation
associated
with
cyber-related
time
element
coverages
is
that
under
all 
insurers’
time
element
insuring
agreements,
coverage
is
triggered
only
by
an
“electronic
disruption” 
(however,
this
term
is
defined
within
a
given
insurer’s
form).
On
the
other
hand,
there
is
never
any 
coverage
for
other
types
of
“traditional”
physical
damage
perils,
such
as
fire,
flood,
windstorm,
or 
earthquake.
Thus,
if
a
fire
were
to
damage
a
business’s
computer
system
and
disrupt
operations
as
a 
result,
no
coverage
would
be
available. 
The
rationale
for
this
approach
is
that
if
a
computer
system
is
disabled
by
“traditional”
physical
damage 
perils
and
a
BI
or
EE
loss
results,
coverage
is
normally
available
(or
could
have
been
arranged)
under 
standard
property
insurance
policies. 
Combined/Single
Coverage
Approaches
Some
insurers
“bundle”
BI
and
EE
coverages
under
a
single
insuring
agreement.
Others
separate
them 
into
two
insuring
agreements.
Still
others
offer
business
interruption,
but
not
extra
expense
coverage. 
Deductible
Approaches
Both
BI
and
EE
insuring
agreements
are
usually
subject
to
a
“time”
deductible
(rather
than
a
“dollar” 
deductible)
before
coverage
applies—most
often
8,
12,
or
24
hours.
In
contrast,
as
will
be
noted
later
in 
this
course,
all
of
the
other
insuring
agreements
are
subject
to
a
dollar
amount
deductible. 
Summary
This
chapter
examined
the
insuring
agreements
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies
written
to
cover 
time
element
losses,
including
the
following. 
•
Business
interruption
•
Extra
expense
Each
insuring
agreement
is
subject
to
various
limitations.
Not
all
insurers
offer
time
element
coverages, 
while
some
provide
only
business
interruption,
but
not
extra
expense
coverage. 
Some
insurers
that
write
business
interruption
coverage
also
provide
(a)
dependent
business
interruption 
and/or
(b)
extended
business
interruption
coverages. 
Time
element
coverages,
unlike
the
other
types
of
insuring
agreements
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies, 
contain
time
deductibles
rather
than
dollar-denominated
deductibles.

First-Party 
Theft
of
Property
Insuring
Agreements
Overview
The
five
major
types
of
first-party
theft
of
property
insuring
agreements
include
the
following. 
•
Data
asset
coverage
•
Cyber
extortion
coverage
•
Computer

coverage
•
Funds

coverage
•
Social
engineering/fraudulent

coverage
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Identify
the
insuring
agreements
commonly
used
to
cover
first-party
theft
of
property
loss 
exposures.
•
Recognize
the
manner
in
which
each
insuring
agreement
applies
to
a
given
claims
scenario.
•
Recognize
the
key
coverage
limitations
and
extensions
associated
with
each
of
these
insuring 
agreements.
74Data
Asset
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
the
cost
of
restoring
and
recovering
the
data
lost
from
the
“failure
of
an 
insured’s
computer
security,”
meaning
situations
where
a
computer
system
is
breached
by
a
hacker. 
There
is
no
coverage
under
this
insuring
agreement
for
the
cost
of
research
needed
to
recover
lost
data.
In 
effect,
the
policies
exclude
coverage
for
the
expense
required
to
perform
“pencil-and-paper”
research
to 
recapture
lost
data.
Rather,
the
forms
only
cover
the
expense
incurred
by
“electronic”
recovery
methods, 
such
as
locating
seemingly
lost
data
that
has
been
backed-up
within
the
insured’s
computer
system,
yet 
requires
a
high
level
of
expertise
to
find
and
then
restore
the
system
to
working
order.
It
would
also,
for 
example,
cover
the
cost
of
restoring
a
company’s
data
by
removing
a
virus
that
has
corrupted
the
data. 
But,
on
the
other
hand,
this
insuring
agreement
would
not
cover
the
costs
of
recreating
such
data
from 
scratch. 
Important
Coverage
Limitations
and
Variations
A
number
of
limitations
and
variations
are
found
within
the
data
asset
coverage
insuring
agreement,
as 
offered
by
various
insurers,
and
are
enumerated
in
Exhibit
11.1. 
75Exhibit
11.1
 
Restrictions
and
Variations
within
Data
Asset
Insuring
Agreements
The
following
are
among
the
most
important
limitations
and
variations
found
within
the
various 
insurers’
policies.
Limitations
•
No
Fidelity
Coverage
.
Coverage
usually
does
not
apply
when
loss
of
data
assets
is
caused 
by
intentional
employee
acts.
The
intent
of
this
restriction
is
to
avoid
providing
what
would 
essentially
be
fidelity/employee
dishonesty
coverage.
However,
coverage
does
apply
to 
unintentional
employee
acts,
such
as
when
an
employee
accidentally
erases
data.
•
No
Coverage
for
Software
Upgrades
.
Nor
does
this
insuring
agreement
cover
the
cost
of 
upgrading
software
or
other
programs
during
the
data
restoration
process.
(Sometimes 
security
breaches
result
because
a
system
was
not
equipped
with
the
latest
security 
software.)
The
intent
is
to
make
the
insured
“whole”
following
a
loss,
but
not
to
put
the 
insured
in
a
better
position
as
a
consequence
of
a
data
breach
or
disruption.
Variations
•
Preapproval
Requirements
.
Under
some
forms,
the
insurer
must
preapprove
all
data 
restoration
expenditures,
whereas
under
others,
this
is
not
required.
•
Variations
in
Covered
Causes
of
Loss
.
A
number
of
policies
only
provide
coverage
for
loss 
caused
by
an
intentional
“electronic
disruption,”
such
as
a
theft
of
data,
the
introduction
of
a 
virus,
or
the
launching
of
a
spam
attack.
Other
broader
policies
cover
these
perils,
as
well
as 
loss
from
additional
causes,
such
as
accidental
erasure.
Data
Asset
Coverage
Loss
Scenarios
A
hacker
manages
to
gain
access
to
an
insured’s
entire
customer
database.
Following
the
discovery
of
the 
breach,
the
database
can
no
longer
be
accessed
by
the
insured.
This
insuring
agreement
would
cover
the 
insured’s
cost
to
recapture
the
“lost”
customer
database
that
had
been
backed-up
within
the
insured’s 
computer
system,
but
which
requires
time
and
other
expenses
to
recover. 
76Cyber
Extortion
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
loss
sustained
from
computer-aided
extortion.
Cyber
extortion
consists
of 
threats
to
(1)
commit
an
intentional
computer
attack,
(2)
damage
or
shut
down
a
computer
system,
(3) 
disclose
confidential
information,
(4)
block
access
to
a
computer
system,
or
(5)
introduce
a
virus
into
a 
computer
system
unless
the
insured
pays
a
specified
sum
of
money
to
the
extortionist. 
There
are
three
elements
of
loss
covered
by
this
insuring
agreement. 
Coverage
for
Cyber
Extortion
Demands
First,
this
insuring
agreement
covers
ransom
monies
required
to
be
paid
as
a
result
of
extortion
demands. 
Coverage
To
Prevent
Further
Extortion
Second,
this
insuring
agreement
pays
monies
to
a
computer
security
systems
expert
to
provide
an 
assessment
and
report
containing
recommendations
aimed
at
preventing
future
extortion
attempts.
It
is 
important
to
note
that
under
most
insurers’
policies,
coverage
of
such
costs
first
requires
insurer
approval 
of
the
expert
who
will
perform
the
assessment. 
Coverage
for
Expense
Required
in
Dealing
with
the
Cyber
Extortionist
Third,
this
insuring
agreement
pays
the
cost
of
hiring
the
expert(s)
required
to
negotiate
with
the
cyber 
extortionist.
Insurers
have
networks
of
such
experts
available
to
assist
insureds
under
these
circumstances. 
Availability
of
this
service
is
perhaps
the
most
valuable
element
of
this
insuring
agreement,
since
few 
businesses
have
the
expertise
to
deal
successfully
with
ransom
demands
of
this
nature. 
An
Important
Coverage
Restriction:
No
Coverage
of
Employee
Acts
One
important
aspect
of
cyber
extortion
coverage
is
that
it
usually
does
not
apply
to
acts
committed
by 
employees.
Thus,
if
an
employee
of
the
named
insured
attempts
to
extort
monies
from
her
employer
by 
means
of
threats
to
shut
down
or
damage
a
computer
network,
this
insuring
agreement
will
not
normally 
apply.
The
rationale
for
this
approach
is
that
such
losses
fall
more
within
the
realm
of
fidelity/employee 
dishonesty
coverage
and,
thus,
should
not
be
the
subject
of
cyber
and
privacy
insurance.
The
“spirit”
of 
cyber
and
privacy
policies
is
to
address
threats
from
outside
of—rather
than
within—an
organization. 
Note,
however,
that
there
is
no
universal
insurer
agreement
on
this
coverage
point,
and
thus,
a
minority
of 
insurers’
forms
do
cover
employee
extortion
incidents. 
Cyber
Extortion
Coverage
Loss
Scenario
An
insured
receives
an
email
from
an
individual
who
threatens
to
shut
down,
damage/deface,
introduce
a 
virus
into,
disclose
confidential
information
from,
block
access
to,
or
attack
in
some
other
way
a 
company’s
website
unless
the
insured
pays
a
$10
million
ransom.
(Note
that
historically,
the
majority
of 
ransom
demands
have
fallen
within
a
range
of
$100,000
to
$5
million.) 
An
insured
is
contacted
by
telephone
and
is
told
by
the
caller
that
its
website
will
be
shut
down
by
a 
denial
of
service
attack
within
30
minutes
and
that
the
attack
will
continue
until
the
insured
wires
$20 
million
to
an
offshore
bank
account.
This
insuring
agreement
would
cover
the
ransom
demand,
the
cost
of 
hiring
a
negotiator
to
deal
with
the
cyber
extortionist,
and
the
expense
of
bringing
in
a
computer
security
77expert
to
provide
an
assessment
and
recommendations
aimed
at
preventing
future
extortion
attempts. 
78Computer
Fraud
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
loss
from
intentional,
fraudulent,
unauthorized
entry
into
a
computer 
system
resulting
in
a
theft
of
money
or
data. 
An
Important
Coverage
Restriction:
No
Coverage
for
Employee
Acts
As
is
also
the
case
with
respect
to
cyber
extortion
coverage,
computer
fraud
coverage
does
not
apply
to 
acts
committed
by
employees
since
they
more
appropriately
fall
within
the
scope
of
fidelity/employee 
dishonesty
coverage
and,
thus,
should
not
be
addressed
by
cyber
and
privacy
insurance. 
Computer
Fraud
Loss
Scenario
A
cyber
thief
obtains
the
savings
account
numbers
and
passwords
belonging
to
various
customers
of
Bank 
X
by
hacking
into
X’s
computer
system.
The
thief
then
uses
this
information
to
withdraw
$500,000
from 
the
customers’
accounts
by
using
Bank
X’s
ATM
machines. 
79Funds
Transfer
Fraud
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
covers
loss
sustained
when
funds
are
fraudulently
transferred
from
one
financial 
institution
to
another. 
Funds
Transfer
Fraud
Loss
Scenario
A
representative
loss
scenario
would
involve
a
situation
where
a
stock
brokerage
firm
in
the
United
States 
receives
an
email
that
“appears”
to
be
from
a
US
bank
(but
is
not).
The
broker’s
employee
opens
the 
email,
which
activates
a
virus,
allowing
the
thief
to
access
the
account
numbers
and
passwords
of
the 
brokerage’s
customers.
The
hacker
then
uses
this
information
to
transfer
monies
from
the
brokerage 
accounts
to
her
bank
in
Eastern
Europe. 
An
Important
Coverage
Restriction:
No
Coverage
for
Employee
Acts
Again,
given
the
distinct
possibility
that
otherwise
covered
losses
could
be
caused
by
employees
(as
is 
also
the
case
regarding
computer
fraud
and
cyber
extortion
insuring
agreements,
discussed
above),
this 
insuring
agreement
does
not
apply
to
losses
caused
by
employees. 
Computer
Fraud
Coverage
versus
Funds
Transfer
Fraud
Coverage
The
key
difference
between
coverage
applicable
under
the
computer
fraud
insuring
agreement
and
the 
funds
transfer
fraud
insuring
agreement
is
that
the
latter
involves
transfer
of
monies
from
one
financial 
institution
to
another.
In
contrast,
the
example
illustrating
a
computer
fraud
incident
in
which
the
hacker 
obtained
savings
account
numbers
and
passwords
and
used
this
information
to
withdraw
$500,000
did
not 
entail
the
fraudulent
transfers
of
monies
between
two
financial
institutions.
Rather,
the
fraud
was 
perpetrated
by
computer
and
resulted
in
the
theft
of
money
by
means
of
ATM
machines. 
80Social
Engineering/Fraudulent
Instruction
Coverage
This
insuring
agreement
provides
coverage
for
losses
resulting
from
attempts
to
have
insureds
transfer 
monies
(usually
by
means
of
wire
transfers)
based
on
instructions
(typically
in
the
form
of
an
email)
in 
which
the
recipient
is
instructed
to
transfer
funds
from
one
financial
institution
to
another.
For
this
reason, 
a
number
of
insurers’
policies
refer
to
this
insuring
agreement
as
“fraudulent
instruction”
coverage. 
Important
Coverage
Restrictions
There
are
two
important
coverage
restrictions
associated
with
social
engineering/fraudulent
instruction 
coverage. 
First,
coverage
applies
excess
of
any
applicable
crime
insurance
that
the
insured
has
available. 
Second,
no
coverage
applies
to
any
loss
involving
a
fraudulent
instruction
that
was
not
verified
using
an 
out-of-band
authentication
.
The
latter
term
refers
to
a
type
of
two-factor
authentication
process
that 
makes
hacking
difficult
because
it
requires
two
separate
and
unconnected
authentication
channels
to
gain 
access
to
a
system.
For
example,
such
a
system
might
require
(1)
a
personalized
password
and
(2)
the 
entry
of
an
ever-changing
passcode
that
an
employee
may
have
on
a
physical
“token”
she
keeps
on
her 
person
at
all
times. 
Social
Engineering
Coverage
versus
Funds
Transfer
Fraud
Coverage
The
key
difference
between
coverage
applicable
under
the
funds
transfer
fraud
insuring
agreement
and 
the
social
engineering/fraudulent
instruction
insuring
agreement,
is
that
the
latter
involves
a
voluntary 
transfer
of
monies
from
the
insured
to
another
party.
In
contrast,
the
example
illustrating
a
computer
fraud 
incident
(in
which
the
hacker
obtained
savings
account
numbers
and
passwords
and
then
used
this 
information
to
withdraw
$500,000)
did
not
entail
the
voluntary
transfer
of
monies.
Rather,
the
fraud
was 
perpetrated
by
an
involuntary
transfer
of
monies
by
the
hacker
from
the
individual
accounts
to
the
ATM 
machines
and,
ultimately,
to
the
hacker. 
Social
Engineering/Fraudulent
Instruction
Loss
Scenario
The
treasurer
at
Company
X
receives
an
email
from
what
appears
to
be
Security
National
Bank
requesting 
an
immediate
transfer
of
$25,000
to
cover
an
outstanding
check,
which
seems
appropriate
and
legitimate. 
Accordingly,
per
the
instructions
contained
in
the
email,
the
treasurer
wire
transfers
$25,000
(from 
another
bank
in
which
Company
X
has
an
account),
as
requested.
In
fact,
the
$25,000
ends
up
in
the 
phisher’s
offshore
bank
account,
rather
than
in
Company
X’s
account
at
Security
National
Bank. 
81Many
Insurers
Do
Not
Offer
Theft
of
Property
Coverages
A
substantial
minority
of
insurers
do
not
offer
any
of
the
five
theft
of
property
coverages
discussed
above. 
This
is,
as
already
noted,
because
these
insurers
philosophically
view
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
as 
coverage
for
(1)
notification
and
crisis
management
costs,
(2)
regulatory
defense
and
penalties,
and
(3) 
third-party/liability
losses
rather
than
for
first-party/property
losses. 
Insurers
also
avoid
providing
theft
of
property
coverages
because
a
number
of
the
losses
these
insuring 
agreements
address
can
also
be
covered
under
other
types
of
policies,
such
as
kidnap
and
ransom
(i.e., 
cyber
extortion)
and
crime
(i.e.,
computer
fraud,
funds
transfer
fraud,
and
social
engineering)
forms. 
Summary
This
chapter
examined
the
insuring
agreements
written
to
cover
the
five
major
types
of
first-party 
property
loss
exposures,
which
include
the
following. 
•
Data
asset
coverage
•
Cyber
extortion
•
Computer
fraud
•
Funds
transfer
fraud
•
Social
engineering/fraudulent
instruction
coverage
The
chapter
explained
the
nature
of
each
insuring
agreement,
provided
a
loss
scenario
indicating
where 
and
how
the
insuring
agreement
applies,
and
described
the
various
coverage
limitations
applying
to 
several
of
these
insuring
agreements.

Cyber
and
Privacy
Insurance:
Limits, 
Retentions,
and
Other
Important
Policy 
Provisions
Overview
The
manner
in
which
limits
and
retentions
provisions
of
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy
apply
has
an 
important
effect
on
the
extent
of
coverage
the
policies
afford. 
A
number
of
other
policy
provisions
also
have
a
material
effect
on
the
extent
to
which
a
cyber
and 
privacy
policy
will
respond
to
a
loss.
Such
provisions
include
the
following. 
•
Limits/deductibles
•
Insured
persons/insured
organizations
•
Covered
defense
costs
•
Settlement
provisions
•
Coverage
trigger
provisions
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Recognize
how
the
limits
and
retentions
provisions
apply
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies.
•
Recognize
how
these
other
provisions
function
within
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy.
•
Recognize
how
the
provisions
operate
within
a
given
loss
scenario.
•
Identify
important
variations
between
these
provisions
on
an
insurer-to-insurer
basis.
•
Identify
key
limitations
that
are
a
part
of
such
provisions.
Limits
and
Deductibles
83The
policies
are
written
with
both
of
the
following. 
•
A
per
claim
limit
for
each
of
the
individual
insuring
agreements
that
the
insured
has
purchased
•
An
annual
aggregate
limit
that
applies
across
all
of
the
different
insuring
agreements
that
the 
insured
has
purchased
(The
annual
aggregate
limit
is
typically
the
total
of
the
per-claim
limits
for 
the
individual
insuring
agreements
the
insured
has
purchased.)
•
A
per
claim
deductible
for
each
of
the
insuring
agreements
the
insured
has
purchased
Implications
of
Limits
and
Deductibles
Provisions
The
fact
that
the
policies
contain
insuring
agreement-specific
limits
and
deductibles,
coupled
with
an 
annual
aggregate
limit,
has
several
implications.
First,
it
requires
the
insured
to
make
multiple
decisions 
when
buying
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
.
Second,
it
constricts
the
true
extent
of
coverage
that
a
cyber 
and
privacy
policy
actually
provides.
Lastly,
it
adds
complexity
to
the
overall
purchasing
process. 
Exhibit
12.1
offers
a
case
study
of
how
deductibles
and
limits
apply
under
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy. 
84Exhibit 12.1
Application of Limits and Deductibles: A Case Study
Insuring Agreement Per-Loss Limit Covered Loss Deductible
Privacy Notification
and Crisis Management$10 million $5 million $10,000
Regulatory Defense
and Penalties$5 million $2 million $5,000
Information Security
and Privacy Liability$20 million $15 million $25,000
Aggregate Limit: $35 million
Assume that a covered loss involved each of the three insuring agreements  noted in Exhibit 12.1 in the 
amounts of $5 million,  $2 million, and $15 million, respectively.  In this situation, the insurer will pay the 
sum of these losses, or $22 million,  less $40,000 (the total of the respective  deductible  amounts applicable  
under each of the three insuring agreements).
Also recognize  that $13 million remains available to pay any additional  covered losses sustained during 
the current policy term (i.e., $35 million  aggregate  limit less $22 million already paid = $13 million 
remaining  limits).
Other Approaches  to the Application  of Deductibles
Although  Exhibit 12.1 presents one common approach to the application  of deductibles  in cyber and 
privacy policies, other insurers offer slightly different options. For example,  one leading underwriter’s  
form contains a separate deductible  for the notification/crisis  management  insuring agreement,  one for the 
liability insuring agreements  purchased  by the insured, and one for the policy’s first-party  coverages.  
Alternatively,  other insurers provide a “single highest retention”  endorsement  under which only one 
deductible  would apply to a given loss (i.e., the largest one applicable  to all of the insuring agreements  
that have been purchased).
Selecting  Limits and Deductibles
Expert broker advice is essential in choosing appropriate  limits and deductibles.  Brokers often have 
databases  to assist in arriving at these amounts. Specifically,  they can use the limits/deductibles  purchased  
by “comparable”  businesses  to guide them in recommending  limits/deductibles  to an individual  insured. 
Business interruption  work sheets  (used in purchasing  property insurance  policies) are also an effective 
tool in estimating  potential time element losses and selecting appropriate  limits.
Exhibit 12.2 lists a number of key factors in arriving at optimal limits and deductibles.
85Exhibit
12.2
 
Key
Factors
in
Selecting
Limits
and
Deductibles
•
Business/Industry
Type.
“Data-rich”
industries,
such
as
health
care,
are
especially 
vulnerable
to
cyber
losses
(e.g.,
thieves
can
use
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
to 
commit
Medicare/Medicaid
fraud).
•
Business
Size/Number
of
Electronic
Records.
Typically,
the
higher
a
business’s
gross 
sales,
the
larger
its
number
of
different
customers.
And
since
data
breach
costs
are
roughly 
$200
per
electronic
file
(under
the
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
insuring 
agreement),
the
total
number
of
electronic
records
maintained
by
a
business
has
a 
substantial
effect
on
the
size
of
the
cyber
loss
it
can
be
expected
to
sustain.
•
Geographical
Dispersion
of
Customers.
The
more
jurisdictions
(i.e.,
states)
in
which
a 
business’s
customers
are
located,
the
larger
the
number
of
involved
regulatory
authorities 
(and
thus,
the
higher
the
potential
costs
under
the
regulatory
defense
and
penalties
insuring 
agreement)
can
be
following
a
loss.
•
Loss
Control
Program.
An
effective
loss
control
program
can
both
reduce
the
likelihood
of
a 
breach
and
also
lower
the
potential
costs
of
a
breach.
•
Loss
History.
A
prior
loss
may
actually
be
a
“positive,”
if
it
impels
an
insured
company
to 
implement
robust
loss
control
measures.
•
Contractual
Risk
Transfer
Arrangements.
Outside
vendors
(e.g.,
data
storage
firms)
and 
technology
consultants
with
which
an
insured
does
business
should
be
required
to
sign
hold 
harmless
agreements
and
provide
evidence
of
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O) 
coverage.
Such
arrangements
will,
in
theory
at
least,
reduce
the
policy
limits
an
insured 
needs
to
maintain.
However,
such
firms
should
not
be
permitted
to
limit
their
liability
to
the 
amount
of
their
insurance
coverage.
•
Cash
Position.
This
is
especially
important
in
determining
deductible
amounts
for
time 
element
coverages,
since
many
small
businesses
cannot
continue
to
operate
for
long
if
their 
cash
flow
is
interrupted
by
an
electronic
shutdown.
Insured
Organization
and
Insured
Individuals
Cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms
are
designed
to
cover
a
broad
range
of
individuals
and
organizations. 
Named
Insured
and
Subsidiaries
The
policies
cover
the
entity
named
on
the
declarations
page
known
as
the
“named
insured.”
In
addition, 
coverage
also
applies
to
“subsidiaries”
of
the
“named
insured,”
which
is
generally
defined
as
entities
in 
which
the
“named
insured”
holds
a
majority
ownership
interest. 
Insured
Individuals
A
wide
range
of
persons
are
insureds
under
the
policies,
including
the
following. 
•
Directors,
officers,
and
managers
•
Partners
and
principals
(and
often,
but
not
always,
stockholders)
•
Employees
(often,
but
not
always,
including
temporary,
part-time,
and
leased
employees)
•
Former/past
insured
persons
•
Estates,
heirs,
executors,
administrators,
assigns,
and
legal
representatives
•
Spouses
(often,
but
not
always,
including
domestic
partners)
Coverage
of
Independent
Contractors
A
minority
of
forms
cover
independent
contractors
as
insureds.
Such
coverage
is
qualified,
however,
by 
the
fact
that
it
extends
only
to
independent
contractors
“for
whom
the
insured
organization
is
legally
86responsible.”
Thus,
no
coverage
applies
to
independent
contractors
unless
they
are,
in
effect,
working
in 
tandem
with
the
insured
organization,
such
as
on
a
specific
project. 
Defense
Cost
Provisions
The
defense
provisions
in
cyber
and
privacy
forms
are
among
the
most
important
contained
within
the 
policies.
The
two
key
concepts
relating
to
the
payment
of
defense
costs
under
the
policies
are
(1)
defense 
costs
(as
well
indemnity
payments;
i.e.,
settlements
and
judgments)
reduce
policy
limits,
and
(2) 
retentions
under
the
policy
also
apply
to
defense
costs—as
well
as
to
indemnity
payments—so
that
there 
is
no
“first
dollar”
defense
coverage
provided. 
Defense
Cost
Payments
Reduce
Policy
Limits
Unlike
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)
insurance
policies,
which
pay
defense
costs
on
an
unlimited 
basis,
payment
of
defense
costs
under
cyber
and
privacy
forms
reduces
available
limits
(this
is
also 
known
as
a
“shrinking
limits”
policy). 
For
example,
assume
a
policy
contained
a
$5
million
information
security
and
privacy
liability
limit. 
Further
assume
that
as
a
result
of
a
covered
claim,
indemnity
(i.e.,
settlement
and
judgment)
payments 
totaled
$3
million,
and
defense
costs
were
$2
million.
In
this
situation,
no
additional
monies
would
be 
available
because
defense
and
indemnity
payments
(i.e.,
$3
million
+
$2
million)
have
already
exhausted 
the
policy’s
$5
million
limit. 
Deductibles
Apply
to
Defense
Costs
Under
cyber
and
privacy
policies,
insurers
do
not
offer
so-called
first-dollar
defense
coverage.
For 
example,
assume
a
claim
required
$250,000
to
defend,
but
no
indemnity
payments
were
involved.
If
the 
policy
was
written
with
a
$50,000
deductible,
the
insurer
and
the
insured
would
pay
$200,000
and 
$50,000,
respectively. 
Implications
for
Policy
Limit
Selection
Given
the
fact
that
(1)
in
many
claims,
defense
costs
far
exceed
indemnity
payments,
(2)
insurers
do
not 
offer
first-dollar
defense,
and
(3)
defense
costs
reduce
policy
limits,
insureds
should
bear
these
facts
in 
mind
when
selecting
policy
limits. 
Defense
and
Settlement
Procedures
The
defense
and
settlement
procedures
contained
within
the
policies
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the 
insured’s
rights
in
a
claim
situation. 
Duty
To
Defend
versus
Non-Duty
To
Defend
Policies
Cyber
and
privacy
policies
written
with
duty
to
defend
wording
require
the
insurer
to
assume
the
defense 
of
all
claims
made
against
the
insured
under
a
policy.
Accordingly,
the
insurer
has
the
right
to
(1)
select 
counsel,
(2)
control
the
process
of
settling
a
claim,
and
(3)
determine
the
amount
of
a
settlement.
In 
contrast,
under
non-duty
to
defend
policies
(also
known
as
“reimbursement”
policies),
the
insurer’s
sole 
obligation
is
to
reimburse
the
insured
for
the
defense
and
indemnity
costs
the
insured
has
incurred
in 
settling
a
claim
covered
by
the
policy. 
Most
cyber
and
privacy
forms
are
written
on
a
duty
to
defend
basis,
especially
those
designed
for
private 
companies
and
nonprofit
organizations.
However,
some
policies
give
the
insured
the
option
of
selecting 
either
duty
to
defend
or
non-duty
to
defend
coverage. 
Benefits
of
Duty
To
Defend
Policies
Duty
to
defend
provisions
are
preferable
for
most
insureds
because
few
businesses
have
had
the 
experience
of
defending
a
data
breach
claim.
For
this
reason,
they
are
usually
better
served
by
delegating 
claims
management
responsibilities
to
a
more
knowledgeable
insurer. 
87Coverage
Triggers
As
is
the
case
with
nearly
all
types
of
professional
and
E&O
policy
forms,
the
liability
coverage
sections 
of
cyber
and
privacy
policies
are
written
on
a
claims-made
basis,
meaning
that
for
coverage
to
apply,
a 
claim
must
be
both
(1)
made
against
the
insured
during
the
policy
period
and
(2)
made
on
or
after
the 
policy’s
retroactive
date. 
In
contrast,
the
property
coverage
sections
of
the
policies
are
written
on
an
occurrence
basis,
meaning
that 
coverage
is
triggered
whenever
a
loss
“occurs,”
so
that
unlike
a
claims-made
policy,
claims
can
be
made 
under
an
occurrence
policy
that
has
long
since
expired. 
Because
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
are
written
with
two
different
types
of
coverage
triggers, 
various
foreseeable
complications
can
result
in
the
event
that
a
single
loss
involves
the
application
of
both 
claims-made
and
occurrence
coverage
triggers.
Even
greater
complexity
might
ensue
under
these 
circumstances
because
the
use
of
both
occurrence
and
claims-made
coverage
triggers
could
conceivably 
involve
two
different
policy
periods.
Fortunately,
while
possible,
the
likelihood
of
this
happening
is
low.
Summary
The
manner
in
which
limits
and
retentions
provisions
of
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy
apply
has
an 
important
effect
on
the
extent
of
an
insured’s
recovery
under
a
cyber
and
privacy
form.
This
chapter 
examined
both
types
of
provisions
and
provided
examples
of
how
limits
and
retentions
not
only
apply, 
but
also
interact
in
various
claim
scenarios.
This
chapter
also
analyzed
the
effect
of
the
all-important 
aggregate
limit
that
is
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
forms. 
The
other
provisions
analyzed
in
this
chapter
are
also
a
key
element
in
determining
whether
and
to
what 
extent
a
claim
will
be
covered
under
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy.
These
provisions
include
the
following. 
•
Limits/deductibles
•
Insured
persons/insured
organizations
•
Covered

•

Cyber
and
Privacy
Insurance
Policy 
Exclusions
Overview
This
chapter
examines
the
exclusions
that
are
commonly
found
within
cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms.
Chapter
Objectives
On
completion
of
this
chapter,
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
following. 
•
Identify
key
exclusions
within
cyber
and
privacy
policies.
•
Recognize
how
these
exclusions
operate
and
affect
the
extent
of
coverage
under
the
policies.
•
Recognize
differences
among
various
insurers’
versions
of
these
exclusions.
•
Identify
the
so-called
exceptions
contained
within
these
exclusions.
Fraud,
Criminal,
Dishonest
Acts
Although
coverage
for
fraudulent,
criminal,
and
dishonest
acts
is
excluded
by
nearly
all
of
the
policies, 
this
exclusion
should
only
apply
when
these
acts
are
committed
by
an
insured
and
not
when
caused
by 
third
parties.
Thus,
if
a
nonemployee
hacker
causes
an
insured’s
computer
system
to
crash
because
he 
launched
a
spam
attack,
this
exclusion
would
not
apply.
On
the
other
hand,
if
the
spam
attack
were
the 
work
of
an
employee
(an
insured
under
virtually
all
cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms),
no
coverage
would 
be
available. 
Key
Exception
Wording
The
wording
of
this
exclusion
should
include
(1)
defense
coverage
for
“innocent
insureds”
and
(2)
“final 
adjudication”
defense
coverage
wording. 
89For
example,
the
innocent
insured’s
wording
would
apply
in
the
event
three
employees
were
charged
with 
instigating
a
data
breach,
yet
only
one
of
the
three
were
actually
involved.
Innocent
insured
wording 
within
this
exclusion
would
provide
defense
coverage
to
the
two
employees
who
played
no
role
in
the 
data
breach. 
Final
adjudication
wording
would
provide
defense
coverage
for
the
two
innocent
insureds
until
either
a 
verdict
was
rendered
against
them
or
they
admitted
to
having
committed
the
data
breach.
A
favorable 
variation
of
the
final
adjudication
provision
is
one
that
defines
“final
adjudication”
as
“including
all 
appeals.”
Such
wording
is
valuable
if,
for
example,
a
trial
court’s
verdict
is
rendered
against
an
insured, 
but
the
insured
appeals
the
verdict.
Such
wording
would
cover
the
defense
costs
required
by
the
appeal, 
an
extension
not
available
within
standard
“final
adjudication”
language. 
Bodily
Injury
and
Property
Damage
The
policies
exclude
cyber-related
claims
alleging
bodily
injury
and
property
damage
because
such
losses 
are
covered
under
commercial
general
liability
(CGL)/property
insurance
policies.
However,
the
broadest 
policies
“except”—and
thus
cover—“mental
anguish,”
“shock,”
“emotional
distress,”
and
“humiliation.” 
This
wording
is
valuable
because
in
addition
to
alleging
financial
losses,
lawsuits
(covered
under
the 
information
security
and
privacy
liability
insuring
agreement)
also
sometimes
include
these
types
of 
allegations. 
Employment-Related
Claims
Employment-related
claims
are
excluded
by
cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms
because
employment 
practices
liability
(EPL)
policies
are
designed
to
cover
such
exposures.
However,
the
policies
should 
except—and
thus
cover—employee
suits
alleging
employment-related
privacy
violations,
such
as
when 
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
is
removed
from
human
resources
(HR)
files
or
employee
PII
is 
obtained
via
hacking. 
ERISA
Act
Exposures
The
policies
exclude
coverage
for
exposures
relating
to
an
employer’s
responsibilities
enumerated
by
the 
Employee
Retirement
Income
Security
Act
(ERISA)
of
1974.
This
is
because
these
exposures
are
covered 
by
fiduciary
liability
policies.
However,
cyber
and
privacy
forms
should
except,
and
thus
cover,
claims 
involving
data
breaches
that
impact
employee
benefit
programs,
such
as
when
a
hacker
obtains 
information
about
an
employee’s
medical
condition
that
is
stored
in
an
electronic
file
pertaining
to
the 
health
insurance
coverage
purchased
and
administered
by
an
employer-insured. 
War,
Invasion,
Insurrection
Nearly
all
of
the
policies
exclude
coverage
for
claims
caused
by
war,
invasion,
and
insurrection. 
Furthermore,
a
handful
of
insurers
also
exclude
coverage
for
“terrorism”
within
such
wording.
Yet, 
language
excluding
“terrorism”
is
problematic
because
virtually
every
intentionally
caused
cyber-related 
hacking
or
intrusion
event
could
be
considered
“terrorism,”
thus
affording
the
insurer
an
opportunity
for
a 
coverage
denial.
One
means
of
moderating
the
scope
and
effect
of
this
wording
is
for
insureds
to
request 
that
it
be
modified
to
except,
and
thus
cover,
“electronic
terrorism.”
Wording
of
this
kind
would
at
least 
preserve
coverage
for
hacking/intrusion-driven
losses,
although
it
still
might
preclude
coverage
if,
for 
example,
an
insurer
were
to
assert
that
an
individual
who
stole
paper
files
containing
PII
had
engaged
in 
an
act
of
“terrorism.” 
Patent,
Software
Infringement
Patent
infringement
claim
exposures
are
excluded
by
the
policies
because
they
can
be
covered
by 
intellectual
property
(IP)
insurance
forms.
Nevertheless,
the
broadest
cyber
and
privacy
policies 
affirmatively
cover
infringement
claims
if
they
are
caused
by
non-management
employees
or
by
third 
parties
such
as
technology
contractors
with
whom
an
insured
may
be
working. 
Mechanical
or
Electrical
Breakdown/Failure
90The
policies
exclude
coverage
for
losses
caused
by
mechanical
or
electrical
failures
and
related 
breakdowns
for
two
reasons.
First,
such
failures
do
not
usually
result
from
data
breaches.
Second,
when 
these
kinds
of
breakdowns
do
cause
business
interruption,
the
resulting
losses
are
insurable
under 
standard
property
policies. 
Yet,
some
mechanical
failures
can
be
caused
by
hackers
who,
for
example,
overload
a
system
(i.e.,
by 
generating
a
“spam
attack”
or
by
introducing
a
virus
that
shuts
down
a
system).
As
a
consequence, 
insureds
should
request
wording
that
excepts,
and
thus
covers,
mechanical/electrical
failures
that
are 
intentionally
caused
by
hackers. 
Loss
Involving
Portable
Electronic
Devices
This
exclusion
(while
somewhat
unusual)
is
often
referred
to
as
the
“laptop
exclusion.”
It
is
typically 
added
as
an
exclusionary
endorsement,
rather
than
being
included
within
the
regular
provisions
of
cyber 
and
privacy
policy
forms.
Insurers
will
sometimes
remove
it
if
the
insured
agrees
to
encrypt
(i.e., 
“scramble”
to
make
unreadable)
all
data
contained
on
portable
devices. 
Failure
To
Follow
Minimum
Required
Security
Practices
Applications
for
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
routinely
contain
detailed
questions
regarding
the 
steps
the
applicant
is
currently
taking
to
protect
its
electronic
data.
Accordingly,
a
growing
minority
of 
policies
exclude
coverage
in
the
event
it
can
be
established
that
a
claim
was
caused
by
failure
to
follow 
the
described
procedures
(e.g.,
not
regularly
checking
and
maintaining
security
patches). 
Since
this
exclusion
is
common,
although
not
(yet)
universal,
an
insured
can
avoid
it
by
selecting
a
policy 
that
does
not
contain
an
exclusion
for
failing
to
follow
minimum
security
practices.
If
this
is
not
possible, 
the
insured
should,
first,
take
great
care
when
completing
a
coverage
application,
making
sure
not
to 
overstate
the
nature
of
its
current
cyber
security
measures.
Second,
insureds
should
closely
and 
continuously
monitor
the
extent
to
which
the
procedures
enumerated
within
the
application
are
actually 
being
implemented
once
coverage
is
in
place. 
Professional
Services
This
exclusion
eliminates
coverage
for
what
are
essentially
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O) 
exposures
(i.e.,
providing
technology
products
and
services
to
others
for
a
fee),
rather
than
losses 
resulting
from
data
protection
issues—the
essence
of
cyber
and
privacy
policy. 
If,
for
instance,
a
third-party
contractor
engaged
by
the
insured
committed
an
error
that
exposed
the 
insured’s
customers’
PII,
this
exclusion
would
eliminate
coverage
for
the
insured.
The
solution
to
this 
coverage
gap
is
for
insureds
to
insist
that
all
of
its
third-party
technology
providers
buy
technology
E&O 
coverage
as
a
condition
of
working
with
the
organization.

Summary
Cyber
and
privacy
policy
forms
contain
a
number
of
standard
exclusions.
However,
there
is
considerable 
variation
within
these
exclusions.
Accordingly,
insureds
should
attempt
to
select
policies
containing
the 
most
favorable
versions
of
such
exclusions
and/or
attempt
to
negotiate
with
insurers
to
modify
existing 
exclusionary
wording,
as
explained
in
this
chapter.

trigger
that
obligates
an
insurer
to
defend
and/or
pay
a
claim 
on
an
insured's
behalf
if

(The
term
"made"
means
notification
to

is
being 
requested.) 
cloud
computing
—A
method
of
delivering
information
technology
services
(i.e.,
hardware
and
software) 
in
which
resources
are
hosted
and
retrieved
from
the
Internet
through
Web-based
tools
and
applications 
rather
than
a
direct
connection
to
a

server.
The
cloud
computing
structure
allows
access
to 
information
as
long
as
an
electronic
device
has
access
to
the
Web.
The
word
"cloud"
is
used
as
an
analogy 
for
the
"Internet"
because
many
network

use
the
image
of
a
cloud
to
represent
the

(CGL)
policy
—A
standard
insurance
policy
issued
to

computer
fraud
—In
a
computer
fraud
situation,
after
gaining
access
to
a
company’s
network,
the 
criminal
uses
such
access
to
obtain
valuable

—A
term
that
includes
not
only
servers
and
web
applications
regularly
accessed
by 
desktop,
mobile
phone,
and
laptop
users,
but
also
credit
card
processors,
mobile
apps,
and
other
devices 
connected
to
the
Internet
in
some
capacity. 
computer
virus
—A
hidden,
self-replicating
software
program,
usually
containing
malicious
logic,
that 
propagates
by
inserting
copies
of
itself
into
and
becoming
part
of
another
host
program.
It
is
designed
to 
infect
and
gain
control
over
vulnerable
systems
without
the
user's
knowledge
or
consent
and
is
activated 
when
a
user
runs
or
opens
its
host
program.
Computer
viruses
can
cause
frequent
computer
crashes
or 
pop-up
messages,
corrupt
or
delete
data
on
a
computer,
reformat
the
hard
drive,
use
an
email
program
to 
spread
the
virus
to
other
computers,
or
flood
a
network
with
traffic,
ultimately
making
it
impossible
to
93perform
any
Internet
activity. 
computer
worm
—A
self-replicating,
self-propagating,
self-contained
program
that
uses
network 
mechanisms
to
spread
itself.
Unlike
computer
viruses,
worms
do
not
require
human
involvement
to 
propagate.
Worms
can
do
damage
by
reproduction,
consuming
internal
disk
and
memory
resources
within 
a
single
computer,
exhausting
network
bandwidth,
deleting
files,
or
making
it
impossible
to
send 
documents
via
email. 
coverage
trigger
—The
event
that
must
occur
before
a
particular
liability
policy
applies
to
a
given
loss. 
Under
an
occurrence
policy,
the
occurrence
of
injury
or
damage
is
the
trigger;
liability
will
be
covered 
under
that
policy
if
the
injury
or
damage
occurred
during
the
policy
period.
Under
a
claims-made
policy, 
the
making
of
a
claim
triggers
coverage.
Coverage
triggers
serve
to
determine
which
liability
policy
in
a 
series
of
policies
covers
a
particular
loss. 
credit
monitoring
—Service
that
detects
situations
where
a
“bad
actor”
attempts
to
open
new
or
use 
existing
credit
lines. 
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
—A
type
of
insurance
designed
to
cover
consumers
of
technology
services 
or
products.
More
specifically,
the
policies
are
intended
to
cover
a
variety
of
both
liability
and
property 
losses
that
may
result
when
a
business
engages
in
various
electronic
activities,
such
as
selling
on
the 
Internet
or
collecting
data
within
its
internal
electronic
network. 
Most
notably,
but
not
exclusively,
cyber
and
privacy
policies
cover
a
business's
liability
for
a
data
breach 
in
which
the
firm's
customers'
personal
information,
such
as
Social
Security
or
credit
card
numbers,
is 
exposed
or
stolen
by
a
hacker
or
other
criminal
who
has
gained
access
to
the
firm's
electronic
network. 
The
policies
cover
a
variety
of
expenses
associated
with
data
breaches,
including
notification
costs,
credit 
monitoring,
costs
to
defend
claims
by
state
regulators,
fines
and
penalties,
and
loss
resulting
from
identity 
theft. 
In
addition,
the
policies
cover
liability
arising
from
website
media
content,
as
well
as
property
exposures 
from
(1)
business
interruption,
(2)
data
loss/destruction,
(3)
computer
fraud,
(4)
funds
transfer
loss,
and 
(5)
cyber
extortion. 
Cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
often
confused
with
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O)
insurance.
In 
contrast
to
cyber
and
privacy
insurance,
technology
E&O
coverage
is
intended
to
protect
providers
of 
technology
products
and
services,
such
as
computer
software
and
hardware
manufacturers,
website 
designers,
and
firms
that
store
corporate
data
on
an
off-site
basis.
Nevertheless,
technology
E&O 
insurance
policies
do
contain
a
number
of
the
same
insuring
agreements
as
cyber
and
privacy
policies. 
cyber
extortion
—A
type
of
online
crime
in
which
a
criminal
threatens
to
damage
or
shut
down
a 
company's
website,
email
server,
or
computer
system
or
threatens
to
expose
electronic
data
or
information 
belonging
to
the
company
unless
the
company
pays
the
criminal
a
specific
ransom
amount. 
cyber
extortion
coverage
—An
insuring
agreement
contained
within
some
policies
written
to
cover 
claims
associated
with
data
breaches.
Such
policies
are
most
often
termed
"cyber
and
privacy
insurance," 
"information
security
and
privacy
insurance,"
and
"cyber
security
insurance." 
This
insuring
agreement
covers
the
costs
associated
with
a
cyber
extortion
event
(e.g.,
an
insured
receives 
an
email
stating
that
the
extortionist
will
introduce
a
virus
into
the
insured
company's
website
unless
the 
company
pays
a
$10
million
ransom).
The
costs
covered
by
this
insuring
agreement
include
(1)
monies 
paid
to
meet
extortion
demands,
(2)
the
cost
of
hiring
computer
security
experts
to
prevent
future 
extortion
attempts,
and
(3)
the
expenses
charged
by
professionals
to
deal/negotiate
with
cyber 
extortionists. 
data
asset
coverage
—An
insuring
agreement
in
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy
that
covers
the
cost
of 
restoring
and
recovering
the
data
lost
from
the
“failure
of
an
insured’s
computer
security,”
meaning 
situations
where
a
computer
system
is
breached
by
a
hacker. 
denial
of
service
attack
—A
deliberately
planned
attack
on
a
computer
system
or
network
that
causes
a 
loss
of
use
of
the
computer
system
or
network
to
legitimate
users.
Examples
of
denial
of
service
attacks
94include
flooding
network
connections
to
prevent
legitimate
network
traffic,
denying
communication 
between
systems,
preventing
a
particular
individual
from
accessing
an
Internet-based
service,
and 
disrupting
service
to
a
specific
system
or
individual. 
dependent
business
interruption
loss
—Dependent
business
interruption
loss,
as
defined
by
those 
insurers
whom
offer
this
coverage
within
their
cyber
and
privacy
forms,
typically
results
from
the
failure 
of
service
providers’
computer
systems
(rather
than
the
insured’s
systems).
This
failure,
in
turn,
leads
to 
an
interruption
in
the
insured’s
business
and
a
subsequent
loss
of
revenue. 
discrimination
—Unfair
or
illegal
treatment
of
or
denial
of
rights
to
persons
on
the
basis
of
certain 
arbitrarily
chosen
attributes
or
characteristics,
including
race,
gender,
religion,
creed,
age,
medical 
condition,
pregnancy,
sexual
orientation/preference,
physical
appearance,
marital
status,
physical
or 
mental
disability,
or
national
origin.

extra
expense
coverage
—Insurance
that
pays
for
additional
costs
in
excess
of
normal
operating
expenses 
that
an
organization
incurs
to
continue
operations
while
its
property
is
being
repaired
or
replaced
after 
having
been
damaged
by
a
covered
cause
of
loss. 
funds
transfer
fraud
—A
situation
that
occurs
when
a
cyber
criminal
accesses
a
computer
network
and 
then
uses
such
access
to
fraudulently
transfer
monies
from
one
account
to
another. 
GDPR
—See
General

(GDPR)
—A
regulation
aimed
at
improving
security
for
all 
companies
processing
personal
data
for
subjects
in
the
European
Union
regardless
of
the
company’s 
location.
GDPR
states
that
organizations
can
be
fined
“up
to
4%
of
annual
global
turnover
or
€20
million 
(whichever
is
greater)”
for
the
most
serious
violations. 
identity
theft
monitoring
—A
service
that
can
detect
fraudulent
uses
of
personally
identifiable 
information
(PII). 
information-only
website
—An
Internet
website
that
provides
general
information
about
the
applicant’s 
products/services. 
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
—Collectively
refers
to
the
everyday
devices
that
are
connected
in
some
way
to 
the
Internet.
Many
of
these
devices
are
referred
to
as
"smart"
devices—smartphones,
smart
homes
(e.g., 
Internet-capable
thermostats,
appliances,
and
so
on),
smart
televisions,
and
many
more
devices.
Through 
Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi,
and
other
means
of
wireless
communication,
users
of
smart
devices
are
able
to
control 
them
and
often
times
connect
them
functionally
with 
other
 smart
devices.
Connections
to
the
Internet 
allow
these
devices
to
track
usage
habits,
provide
helpful
recommendations
(e.g.,
a
refrigerator
that
sends 
an
alert
to
a
home
owner's
smartphone
when
a
visit
to
the
grocery
store
is
needed),
and
generally
offer 
users
a
more
interactive
and
feature-rich
experience. 
IoT
—See
Internet

malicious
code
—Any
virus,
Trojan
horse,
malware,
worm,
or
other
similar
software
program,
code,
or 
script
intentionally
designed
to
insert
itself
into
computer
memory
or
onto
a
computer
disk
and
spread 
itself
from
one
computer
to
another 
management
liability
insurance
—Insurance
that
covers
exposures
faced
by
directors,
officers, 
managers,
and
business
entities
that
arise
from
governance,
finance,
benefits,
and
management
activities 
(also
called
"executive
liability
insurance").
This
includes
(1)
directors
and
officers
(D&O)
liability 
insurance,
(2)
employment
practices
liability
(EPL)
insurance,
(3)
fiduciary
liability
insurance,
and
(4) 
"special
crime"
insurance
(covering
kidnap,
ransom,
and
extortion
exposures).
These
coverages
may
be 
written
as
stand-alone
insurance
policies
or
combined
into
a
single
"package"
policy.
Management
95liability
policy
"package"
policies
usually
contain
a
set
of
common
conditions
applying
to
all
of
the 
coverage
lines
purchased.
In
most
cases,
an
insured
must
select
a
minimum
of
two
types
of
coverage
to
be 
eligible
to
purchase
a
management
liability
"package"
policy.
This
arrangement
offers
meaningful 
premium
discounts
because
much
of
the
same
data
is
needed
to
underwrite
EPL,
D&O,
fiduciary,
and 
special
crime
coverages.
Management
liability
"package"
policies
are
usually
available
only
to
privately 
held
firms,
not-for-profit
organizations,
and
small
publicly
traded
companies
(i.e.,
those
with
annual
sales 
of
under
$25
million).
Large
publicly
traded
firms
generally
purchase
stand-alone
policies. 
network
breach
—A
situation
that
occurs
when
someone
gains
access
to
a
computer
network,
despite
not 
being
authorized
to
do
so;
transmits
malicious
code
(e.g.,
a
virus)
to
a
computer
network;
or
prevents
a 
third
party,
who
is
authorized
to
do
so,
from
gaining
access
to
a
computer
network
(i.e.,
a
denial
of 
service
attack). 
occurrence
trigger
—For
coverage
to
be
provided,
the
act
giving
rise
to
a
claim
needs
to
occur
within
the 
policy
period.
The
claim
does
not
need
to
be
reported
during
the
policy
period.
Used
with
liability 
policies.  
payment
card
industry
fines
and
assessments
coverage
—An
insuring
agreement
found
within
cyber 
and
privacy
insurance
policy
forms
that
covers
(1)
fines
and
penalties
assessed
against
the
insured
for 
failing
to
comply
with
Payment
Card
Industry
Data
Security
Standards
and
(2)
defense
costs
incurred,
if 
the
insured
challenges
the
imposition
of
such
penalties
because
the
insured
believes
that
it
complied
with 
requisite
security
standards.
Payment
Card
Industry
Data
Security
Standards
are
a
set
of
proprietary 
information
security
standards
that
have
been
promulgated
for
businesses
that
accept
payment
from
the 
leading
credit
card
issuers,
including
Visa,
MasterCard,
American
Express,
and
Discover.
Coverage
under 
this
insuring
agreement
would
apply
under
the
following
circumstances.
A
retailer
reports
that
the 
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
(including
credit
and
debit
card
information)
belonging
to
its 
customers
was
stolen
by
a
hacker.
An
investigation
reveals
that
the
breach
occurred
because
the
retailer’s 
computer
system
did
not
comply
with
Payment
Card
Industry
Data
Security
Standards.
In
the
event
the 
retailer
was
fined
$100,000
for
failure
to
comply
with
applicable
standards,
this
insuring
agreement
would 
cover
the
fines.
Furthermore,
if
the
retailer
incurred
costs
to
dispute
the
imposition
of
the
$100,000
fine 
(because
it
felt
that
it
did,
in
fact,
comply
with
standards),
this
insuring
agreement
would
cover
those 
required
defense
costs. 
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
—Any
information
that
can
be
used
to
uniquely
identify, 
contact,
or
locate
an
individual,
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
other
sources,
such
as
their
name, 
Social
Security
number,
driver's
license
number,
date
of
birth,
place
of
birth,
mother's
maiden
name,
and 
genetic
information. 
phishing
—A
message,
usually
delivered
via
email
(and
less
frequently
via
telephone),
that
falsely
claims 
to
be
from
a
lawful
business
or
otherwise
legitimate
entity
or
person.
The
message
attempts
to
entice
the 
recipient
into
providing
personal
information,
such
as
Social
Security,
credit
card,
and
bank
account 
numbers.
This
information,
if
obtained,
is
later
used
to
commit
identity
theft.
In
addition
to
phishing
that 
targets
personal
information,
many
phishing
attacks
are
aimed
at
obtaining
sensitive
business
information, 
like
corporate
bank
account
numbers.
"Fraudulent
instruction"
(e.g.,
a
message
claiming
to
be
from
a 
company's
CEO
and
instructing
a
mid-level
employee
to
wire
transfer
a
sum
of
money
to
a
certain 
account)
can
also
be
considered
a
form
of
phishing. 
PII
—See
personally
identifiable
information
(PII). 
privacy
liability
—Liability
a
company
incurs
when
its
computer
system
is
breached
by
a
hacker
and,
as
a 
consequence,
personally
identifiable
information
(PII)
is
released
to
unauthorized
persons. 
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
coverage
—An
insuring
agreement
contained 
within
policies
written
to
cover
claims
caused
by
data
breaches.
Such
policies
are
most
often
termed 
"cyber
and
privacy
insurance,"
"information
security
and
privacy
insurance,"
or
"cyber
security 
insurance." 
Privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
coverage
includes
the
cost
of
(1)
hiring
a
forensics 
expert
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
breach
and
suggesting
measures
to
secure
the
site
and
prevent
future
96breaches,
(2)
hiring
a
public
relations
agency
to
assist
the
insured
in
dealing
with
the
crisis,
(3)
setting
up 
a
post-breach
call
center,
(4)
notifying
affected
individuals
whose
personally
identifiable
information 
(PII)
has
been
compromised,
(5)
monitoring
these
individuals'
credit
(usually
for
1
year),
and
(6)
paying 
the
costs
to
"restore"
stolen
identities
as
a
result
of
a
data
breach
(e.g.,
expenses
of
notifying
banks
and 
credit
card
companies). 
Privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense
coverage
addresses
the
so-called
immediate
response 
costs
associated
with
a
data
breach.
This
insuring
agreement
makes
payments
on
a
"no
fault"
basis
and 
without
admission
of
liability
(as
is
the
case
under
"medical
payments"
coverage,
included
in
a 
homeowners
or
personal
auto
policy
(PAP)).
The
intent
of
such
payments
is
to
discourage
affected 
customers
from
making
claims
associated
with
a
data
breach.
In
contrast,
the
information
security
and 
privacy
liability
insuring
agreement
is
the
true
"liability"
coverage
element
of
a
cyber
and
privacy
policy 
since
it
responds
to
lawsuits
and
pays
liability
losses
from
claims
made
against
the
insured
by
various 
parties. 
Similar
to
other
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies,
privacy
notification
and
crisis
management
expense 
coverage
is
subject
to
an
annual
aggregate
limit
and
an
annual
aggregate
deductible. 
ransomware
—A
technique
in
which
hackers
typically
replace
an
organization's
website
home
page
with 
a
ransom
demand. 
sexual
harassment
—Conduct
involving
unwelcome
sexual
advances;
requests
for
sexual
favors;
and 
verbal,
visual,
or
physical
conduct
of
a
sexual
nature.
There
are
two
types
of
sexual
harassment:
quid
pro 
quo
sexual
harassment,
in
which
sexual
contact
is
made
a
condition
of
employment,
and
hostile 
environment
sexual
harassment,
in
which
such
conduct
creates
an
intimidating,
hostile,
or
offensive 
working
environment.
Lawsuits
against
businesses
that
allege
sexual
harassment
have
increased 
significantly
during
the
past
decade.
Accordingly,
around
1990,
the
insurance
market
began
offering 
employment
practices
liability
(EPL)
policies,
a
specialized
form
of
insurance
covering
claims
of
sexual 
harassment
as
well
as
other
employment-related
torts. 
social
engineering/fraudulent
instruction
coverage
—Coverage
for
losses
resulting
from
attempts
to 
have
insureds
transfer
monies
(usually
by
means
of
wire
transfers)
based
on
instructions
(typically
in
the 
form
of
an
email),
in
which
the
recipient
is
instructed
to
transfer
funds
from
one
financial
institution
to 
another. 
social
media
—Web-based
and
mobile-based
technologies
that
are
used
to
turn
communication
into 
interactive
dialogue
between
organizations,
communities,
and
individuals. 
spam,
spamming
—Sending
unwanted
and
unsolicited
email
to
an
individual's
or
corporation's
computer 
system.
A
massive
spam
attack
on
a
company's
email
system
can
take
up
so
much
space
on
its
server
that 
it
causes
the
system
to
crash.
Such
risks
can
be
insured
against
under
Internet/online
policy
forms
that 
cover
business
interruption
losses. 
spear
phishing
—Phishing
aimed
at
specific
individuals
and/or
companies,
relying
on
the
use
of
personal 
information
to
make
emails
appear
convincing
and
trustworthy.
See
also
phishing. 
technology
errors
and
omissions
(E&O)
insurance
—A
type
of
insurance
designed
to
cover
providers 
of
technology services or product
s.
For
example,
data
storage
companies
and
website
designers 
provide technology
services,
while
computer
software
and
computer
manufacturers
offer technology 
products. 
Technology
E&O
policies
cover
both
liability
and
property
loss
exposures.
Major
liability
insuring 
agreements
include
losses
resulting
from
(1)
technology
services,
(2)
technology
products,
(3)
media 
content,
and
(4)
network
security
breaches.
Key
property
insuring
agreements
provide
coverage
for 
extortion
threats,
crisis
management
expense,
and
business
interruption. 
Technology
E&O
insurance
is
often
confused
with
cyber
and
privacy
insurance.
In
contrast
to
technology 
E&O
coverage,
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
is
intended
to
protect consumers of
technology
products
and 
services.
Nevertheless,
cyber
and
privacy
insurance
policies
do
offer
a
number
of
the
same
insuring 
agreements
as
technology
E&O
policies.

payment,
or
allows

Trojan
horse
—A
type
of
malicious
software
(malware)
named
after
the
wooden
horse
the
Greeks
used
to 
infiltrate
Troy
that
masquerades
as
a
legitimate
computer
program,
such
as
a
game,
image
file,
disk 
utility,
or
even
an
antivirus
program.
Users
are
typically
tricked
into
downloading
Trojan
horses
on
their 
systems
because
they
appear
in
the
form
of
benign,
useful
software
or
files
from
a
legitimate
source.
Once 
activated,
Trojan
horses
can
perform
a
number
of
attacks
on
a
computer
system
that
can
cause
pop-up 
windows
to
delete
files,
steal
data,
give
malicious
users
access
to
a
system,
or
activate
and
spread
other 
malware,
