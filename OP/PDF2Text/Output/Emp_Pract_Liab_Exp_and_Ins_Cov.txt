1 Chapter 1 
Introduction and Course Overview 
IRMI has teamed up with WebCE to bring you this quality continuing education course.  
This Web CE course is designed to give a moderately experienced insurance person a detailed look at 
(1) the liability exposures that give rise to employ ment-related claims and (2) the insurance policies 
that have been developed to cover these exposures. 
The first part of the course begins by describing the most important common law (i.e., law based on 
judicial decisions) exposures to employment litigation and continues by discussing the leading statutory exposures to such claims. Next, the underwriting of employment practices liability (EPL) insurance is analyzed, followed by a description of methods to control employment claims. The first 
part of the course concludes by examining th e various sources of EPL insurance coverage. 
The second part of the course takes a detailed look at the specific coverage terms within employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) policy forms,  including covered persons/organizations and 
covered acts provisions. Next, it discusses third-part y liability coverage, along with “damages” and 
“claim” definitions. Claims management, defense cost, and “special conditions” are also described. 
The course concludes with an analysis of exclusi ons and coverage triggers contained within the 
policies. 
• Chapter 2 discusses three of the five most important common law exposures to employment practices liability claims: discrimination, wrongful termination, and sexual harassment. 
• Chapter 3 continues with the discussion of common law exposures to EPL claims and examines the other two prominent common law exposures to employment claims: retaliation 
and inappropriate employment conduct.  
• Chapter 4 discusses the statutory liability s ources of discrimination claims. The most 
important statutes include Title VII of the Civ il Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1992, 
and the Family and Medical leave Act (FMLA) of 1993.  
• Chapter 5 explores the key factors that insure rs use to price and underwrite EPL coverage, 
including jurisdiction, industry, number of employees, profitability, mix of exempt/nonexempt employees, and claim history. 
• Chapter 6 describes ways to reduce the exposures to EPL claims, including effective hiring, using protective legal documents, reducing risks associated with terminations, correct ways to 
provide references, and methods of preventing sexual harassment claims. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
2 • Chapter 7 enumerates the various sources of employment practices liabilit y coverage, such as 
stand-alone EPL forms, coverage under direct ors and officers (D&O) liability policies, EPL 
endorsements to D&O policies, management lia bility forms, and businessowners policies. 
• Chapter 8 begins the course’s detailed discussi on of employment practices liability policies, 
examining the covered organiza tions, covered persons, and c overed acts provisions in the 
policies. 
• Chapter 9 analyzes the third-party liability, c overed damages, and covered claim definition 
found in employment practices liability policies. 
• Chapter 10 discusses the claims management, de fense cost, and special conditions provisions 
within employment practices liability policies. 
• Chapter 11 lists the exclusions contained in employment practices liability policy forms and 
explains the significance of exception language within these exclusions 
• Chapter 12 analyzes the manner in which an em ployment practices liab ility policy’s coverage 
triggers apply. Concepts such as: claims firs t-made, retroactive dates, discovery provisions, 
and extended reporting provisions, are discussed. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Identify and discuss the five key common law exposures to employment practices liability 
claims.  
2. Explain the significance of the various kinds of “inappropriate em ployment conduct” and 
describe how such conduct produces employment-related claims.  
3. List the most important federal statutes rela ting to workplace discrimination and analyze the 
employment-related exposures such statutes create. 
4. State the key factors used to price employment practices liability insurance coverage and explain the importance of such factors within the underwriting process. 
5. Analyze the most effective methods of reduci ng exposures to employment liability claims 
and demonstrate how such methods can also lower claim settlement amounts. 
6. Discuss the various methods of obtaining employment practices liability insurance coverage. 
7. Explain how the covered persons/covered orga nizations/covered acts  provisions function 
within employment practices liability policies. 
8. Evaluate the scope of coverage provided by: (a) third-party liability provisions, along with 
the (b) “claim” and (c) “damages” defi nitions included within the policies. 
9. Describe the functioning of the (a) claims management, (b) defense cost, and (c) special 
conditions provisions within employment practice liability policies. 
10. List the most important exclusions found w ithin employment practices liability policies and 
explain the operation and significance of the key “exception” wording commonly found within these exclusions.  
11. Identify and describe the major components of th e claims-made coverage triggers used to 
write employment practices liability coverage. 
  
3 Chapter 2 
Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 1) 
Employment liability claims made under common law (i.e., law based on judicial decisions, as 
opposed to statutes) typically arise from one of the following five broad categories of conduct: (1) discrimination, (2) wrongful termination, (3) sexua l harassment (although legally, sexual harassment 
is a form of discrimination), (4) retaliation, and (5) inappropriate employment conduct, a “catchall” 
term that includes, but is not limited to such per ils as invasion of privacy, failure to promote, and 
defamation.  
Chapter 2 will discuss the first three of these common law claim sources: discrimination, wrongful 
termination, and sexual harassment. Chapter 3 will discuss the latter two common law exposures 
(retaliation and inappropriate  employment conduct).  
Discrimination 
Lawsuits alleging employment-re lated discrimination can be gr ouped into one of two broad 
categories: disparate treatment discrimination claims and disparate impact discrimination claims. 
Disparate Treatment Di scrimination Claims 
Disparate treatment discrimination claims involve illegal, deliberate discrimination against an individual, such as failing to promote an otherwi se qualified employee based on race. The seven types 
of discrimination handled by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) include discrimination based on race, sex, national origin, re ligion, age, disability, and Equal Pay Act claims. 
In addition, the EEOC handles claims alleging retaliation based on the making of a claim of discrimination. 
Unconscious Bias  
Within the past 5years, one important, emerging type of disparate treatment claims is that alleging unconscious bias. The core contention underlying unconscious bias is that white men will inevitably slight women and minorities, regardless of th eir conscious efforts to do otherwise.  
The leading proponent of this theory is sociologist  William Bielby, who regularly testifies on behalf 
of plaintiffs in major employment discrimination cases, including those against Wal-Mart, FedEx, and 
Johnson & Johnson. It is Bielby’s belief th at not just white male managers, but all managers, 
unconsciously apply stereotypes in the employment  decision-making process. For example, Bielby 
found that in identifying candidates for management  positions that often require relocation, hiring 
managers systematically excluded women from cons ideration because they reflexively assumed that 
they weren’t interested in jobs that required them to move long distances.  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
4 Criticism of the Unconscious Bias Hypothesis 
Critics of unconscious bias claims assert that while st ereotypes are admittedly involved in interactions 
between strangers, when a manager has known an  employee for a significant period of time, the 
manager will apply what is referred to as “individu ating information,” thereby allowing him/her to 
make decisions on the basis of the employee’s individual skills and abilities, rather than on 
stereotypes.  
Disparate Impact Discrimination  
These claims entail seemingly neutral company policies that have the actual effect of discriminating 
against a certain class of persons—rather than against an individual. For example, if a city required all 
police officers to be at least 5 feet 10 inches tall, a female applicant might allege that this requirement 
unfairly discriminated against females because most women are shorter than 5 feet 10 inches tall. In 
this example, the discrimination is against women,  rather than against a particular woman (which 
would constitute disparate treatment discrimination) because women will be disproportionally affected by such a requirement. However, a succe ssful claimant must also demonstrate that in 
addition to disproportionally impacting a certain class of persons, the policy must bear little or no relationship to the ability to actually perform the j ob in question. The example below illustrates this 
point.  
A Key Example: The Policy Must Bear Upon the Ability To Perform the Job 
A notable example of disparate impact discrimination was involved in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Griggs v. Duke Power Co.  Here, an employer's requirement that all job applicants have a high 
school education or pass a standardized intelligen ce test, while racially neutral, was found to 
constitute disparate impact discrimination. This  was because it had a disproportionate impact on 
minorities and, importantly, was unrelated to actua l job performance for the positions to which the 
requirement pertained.  
Wrongful Termination 
Wrongful termination describes claims brought by a discharged employee against a former employer. Wrongful termination is the act of terminating an em ployee in a manner that is against the law. (The 
three most common legal grounds—(1) violation of p ublic policy, (2) breach of an express or implied 
contract to discharge only for good cause, and (3) br each of an implied covenant of good faith and 
fair dealing—along with examples, are noted belo w.) Two key factors have triggered a marked 
increase in claims alleging wrongful termination during the past three decades: (1) the restructuring of corporate America and (2) the erosion of the employment-at-will doctrine. 
Corporate Restructuring 
Beginning in the 1970s, the large-scale restructuring of corporate America has taken a number of forms, including downsizing, outsourcing, mergers and acquisitions, plant closings, and the transfer of manufacturing to non-U.S. locations. In the aggreg ate, such activities have resulted in substantial 
elimination of jobs, which, in turn has produ ced allegations that employees were wrongfully 
terminated. 
The Employment-at-Will Doctrine 
Historically, in the absence of a written employment contract, employment relationships in the United States were “at will”—that is, both the employer or employee were free to terminate the employment Chapter 2—Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 1) 
5 relationship at any time, for any reason, or for no r eason at all. The majority of the states continue to 
follow the at-will doctrine, although the employment-a t-will rule has eroded somewhat due to modern 
trends in the courts and legislatures that have  expanded employees’ rights to sue for wrongful 
termination. 
Legal Grounds for Wrongful Termination 
There are three legal grounds upon which wrongful di scharge claims can be made: (1) violation of 
public policy, (2) breach of an express or implied contract to discharge only for good cause, and (3) 
breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. These bases are discussed as follows. 
Violation of Public Policy 
Under this theory, which is recognized in more than two-thirds of all states, an employee can pursue a 
wrongful discharge claim when his or her discharge affects a public right. Public policy claims often 
stem from refusal to participate in illegal activiti es (e.g., “padding: the cost of services delivered 
under a government contract), refusal to perform a lawful act (e.g., not consenting to undergo alcohol 
or drug testing where such refusal is protected by law), reporting employer wrongdoing (e.g., 
“whistle-blowing”), or refusing to perform an act th at public policy condemns (e.g., lying under oath).  
Breach of an Express or  an Implied Contract 
An employee allegedly terminated in violation of a contract must be able to prove that (1) the 
employer and employee had entered into an agreement sufficiently definite and certain regarding the conditions of employment; (2) the employer breached the contract; (3) the employee performed his or 
her side of the bargain; and (4) the employee has suffered injury as a result of the employer's breach. 
(In most, the nature of the alleged injury will be  financial. That is, termination caused the ex-
employee to lose income; although in a minority of cl aims, the alleged injury is damage to the ex-
employee’s reputation.) If an employee proves that he or she is entitled to damages under breach of contract, the employee is still obligated to mitigate the potential damages by actively seeking comparable employment.  
Non-Written Employment Contracts 
Even in the absence of a written contract of employment, non-written employment contracts have been found to exist by courts under certain circumstances. Employment manuals or handbooks have 
been found to create an implied contract between  an employee and the employer in cases where the 
employer sets out grievance procedures for employees, either before or after termination. For 
example, in Toussaint v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield , the Michigan Supreme Court held that by 
establishing personnel policies and practices with respect to termination, the employer had created legitimate expectations by its employees that th ey would not be dismissed without cause. Other 
factors that a court may look at to find an implied contract for employment include: (1) material 
contained in a job offer letter, (2) outstanding  praise of an employee's work, (3) favorable 
performance reviews, and (4) length of employment with the company.  
Breach of an Implied Covenant of Good Faith 
Even in the absence of an implied contract of empl oyment, a handful of states have found that there 
exists an implied covenant within the employee- employer relationship. This covenant serves to 
prevent the employer from unjustifiably engaging in conduct that would deny an employee the 
reasonably anticipated benefits of an employment relationship. An example of such a claim would Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
6 include one for which there was no basis for term inating an employee, other than to replace the 
terminated worker with a relative of the supervisor. 
Constructive Discharge 
Wrongful termination also encompasses so-called constructive discharge. In these situations, the 
employee retains his/her job. However, the employee's work environment is intentionally made so 
difficult that he or she is forced to resign to protect his or her financial or physical and emotional well-being (e.g., an employee is forced to work ex cessive hours in physically unsafe conditions or for 
substantially less money than he or she was previously earning). 
Sexual Harassment 
Sexual harassment includes a variety of conduct su ch as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for 
sexual favors, and verbal, visual, and/or physical conduct of a sexual nature. There are two types of 
sexual harassment within a workplace context: (1) quid pro quo sexual har assment and (2) hostile 
environment sexual harassment.  
It should also be mentioned that while sexual harass ment is actually a form of discrimination, it has 
become such a common employment-related cause of action, that it is usually considered as a 
separate category unto itself. 
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment 
Quid pro quo sexual harassment occurs when se xual contact is made a condition of employment, 
meaning that an employee is required to provide sexual favors in return for keeping a job or receiving 
certain benefits or privileges. This could occur, for example, when a superior who has the power to 
confer or withhold a specific penalty or benefit, u ses this power to coerce an employee into engaging 
in unwelcome sexual activity. Case-in-point: a supe rvisor commits quid pro quo sexual harassment 
when he or she obtains sexual favors from one of hi s or her employees in return for a promotion or a 
raise. If proven, employers are almost always stric tly liable (i.e., automatically liable and thus, the 
employer would have no valid defense)  for quid pro quo sexual harassment.  
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment 
Hostile environment sexual harassment, which is  far more common than quid pro quo sexual 
harassment, is conduct of a sexual nature that cr eates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working 
environment, or impedes an individual's work performance. Comments, threats, and pictures are 
frequently the basis on which such claims are made . For example, a person could make a claim of 
hostile environment sexual harassment if he or she were regularly subjected to jokes of a sexual nature by coworkers.  
Factors in Assessing Whether an Environment is Hostile 
The EEOC examines the following six factors in assessing whether an environment is hostile: (1) whether the conduct was verbal or physical, or both; (2) the frequency of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct was hostile or potentially offensive; (4) whether the offensive conduct was by a coworker or supervisor; (5) the number of persons involved in th e harassment; and (6) whether the harassment was 
directed at more than one individual. 
  Chapter 2—Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 1) 
7 Single Event Can Constitute Hostile  Environment Sexual Harassment 
Some courts have held that a single incident is sufficient to create a hostile environment. For 
example, in Radtke v. Everett, the Michigan Supreme Court held that a single incident, if severe 
enough (e.g., a sexual assault), can create a hostile envi ronment, if perpetrated by an employer in a 
close-knit environment. 
Failure To Protect an Employee from Se xual Harassment by a Non-Employee 
One subcategory of hostile environment sexual har assment claims includes those arising from an 
employer’s failure to protect an employee from sexual harassment by a nonemployee. Typically, 
sexual harassment claims arise when one employee alleges that another employee harassed him or her. However, claims are sometimes made by employees, charging harassment by non-employee third 
parties such as customers, clients, vendors, or independent contractors. 
For example, in Powell v. Las Vegas Hilton Corp ., a casino worker claimed hostile work environment 
sexual harassment because customers repeatedly told her that she had a “nice body,” stared at her, and 
made suggestive remarks. She contended, and the cour t agreed with her, that her employer was liable 
if her employer knew of the harassment and failed to promptly take necessary steps to stop it.  
No Need To Prove Psychological Harm 
The U.S. Supreme Court held in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., that a plaintiff does not have to 
prove that he or she suffered permanent or long-t erm psychological harm as a result of harassment to 
recover damages. Prior to this case, some federal ap pellate courts were requiring a plaintiff to prove 
psychological harm arising from sexual harassment . Eliminating this requirement greatly increases 
the chance that a plaintiff will be able to successfully establish a hostile environment sexual 
harassment claim. 
Jury Trials and Monetary Recoveries Permitted 
The Civil Rights Act of 1991 amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which previously contained 
significantly fewer remedies for sexual harassment. Th e Civil Rights Act of 1991 now allows (1) jury 
trials in hostile environment sexual harassment ca ses and (2) punitive damages. The earlier Act only 
permitted such recoveries in quid pr o quo sexual harassment cases and did not allow either jury trials 
or punitive damages awards in any type of sexual harassment claim.  
Affirmative Defenses to Hostile En vironment Sexual Harassment Claims 
The case of Madray v. Publix Supermarkets  established that if an employer has developed, 
communicated, and enforced a sexual harassment policy but an employee fails to avail him or herself 
of that policy by not reporting sexual harassment , the company has a valid defense to a hostile 
environment sexual harassment claim. In that case, the court rejected two employees’ claims for hostile work environment sexual harassment because the employees failed to take advantage of opportunities provided by the employer to correct (i.e., report) the alleged harassment.  
Sexual Harassment Policy—by Itself—Not a Defense 
The ruling does not, however, hold that a comprehens ive sexual harassment policy, in itself, is 
sufficient to defend against all hostile work environment claims. Therefore, employers must not only create, communicate, and enforce sexual harassment  policies and procedures, but must also act 
promptly and appropriately to investigate all har assment claims. The extent to which each of these 
actions is taken, will add to an employer’s  defense in any sexual harassment claim.  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
8 The number of sexual harassment claims increased significantly during the 1990s. The greatest rise in 
frequency occurred between 1991 a nd 1992, immediately after the Clarence Thomas hearings were 
held in the fall of 1991. (These hearings occurre d when Thomas was being confirmed as a justice of 
the United States Supreme Court.)  
According to Jury Verdict Research  Institute, the median jury verdict in sex discrimination claims 
filed between 2000 and 2006 (which included sexua l harassment), was $200,000. When any given 
case goes to trial, the probability of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff hovers around 66 percent. 
However, during the same time period, when a case was settled on an out-of-court basis, the median 
settlement amount was only $69,000. These numbers do not include legal fees, time required to 
defend the claim, and lowered mora le within the organization.  
The law firm of Littler Mendelson, P.C. a nd Employment Law Learning Technologies (ELT) 
conducted a study in which they developed a list of both “hard” (i.e., quantifiable) and “soft” (i.e., 
non-quantifiable) costs associated with sexual harass ment claims. These costs are outlined in Exhibit 
2.1. 
 
Exhibit 2.1 
Sexual Harassment Claims Costs 
Hard Costs 
• Attorney fees, settlement costs, or jury awards (if 
the case is not settled) 
Soft Costs 
• Employee distraction and reduced morale  
• Manager time expended in the claim process 
• Employee time expended in claim process.  
• Employee time spent investigating the claim  
• Employee time spent preparing for trial  
• Increased future insurance costs  
• Lowered stock price and damage to corporate 
reputation  
• Potential of copycat lawsuits due to internal and 
external publicity  
• Increased difficulty in attracting top employees 
given negative publicity

11 Chapter 3 
Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 2) 
Chapter 3 will discuss the two additional common la w claim sources of employment-related claims: 
retaliation and inappropriate  employment conduct.  
Retaliation 
Recent years have witnessed an explosion in th e number of employment-related claims alleging 
retaliation. The typical scenario surrounding a retalia tion claim is as follows. The first portion of an 
employment-related claim will most frequently (but not always) allege that an employee was 
discriminated against based on a protected status , such as race, gender, or disability. The second 
portion of the claim will assert that in retaliation for making such a claim, the employee was treated 
adversely. For example, after alleging discrimina tion based on race, an employee is demoted. In 
addition, retaliation can occur under a variety of other circumstances, such as an employee being 
retaliated against for: making a workers compensati on claim, for whistle blowing, or for criticizing 
management.  
One especially problematic aspect of retaliation claims  is that they can remain even after a court 
rejects the first portion of the employee’s complaint alleging discrimination or other “standard” 
employment practices allegation. Under these ci rcumstances, the employee still possesses a viable 
claim of retaliation if he or she can prove that  an employer penalized him or her for making a 
complaint or engaging in some other form of prot ected activity. Thus, in the example above, a court 
could rule that there was no discrimination on the basis of race, but that the employee was wrongly demoted in retaliation for making the discrimination claim. In effect, a retaliation claim can still be 
ruled valid, even if the underlying claim that gave rise to the retaliation is not. 
Elements of a Retaliation Claim  
A successful claim of retaliation must prove thr ee elements: (1) that the employee engaged in a 
protected activity; (2) that the employee suffered an  adverse action; and (3) that there was a causal 
connection between the adverse ac tion and the protected activity. 
Protected Activities 
Examples of protected activities include alleging em ployment discrimination; opposing employment 
discrimination; threatening to file a formal complaint concerning illegal corporate practices; requesting a religious or disability accommodation;  or making a complaint to a manager, union 
official, or newspaper reporter about di scrimination against oneself or others. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
12 Adverse Actions 
Examples of obvious types of adverse actions incl ude: denial of a promotion, refusal to hire, 
demotion, suspension, and discharge. Other examples of adverse action include threats, reprimands, 
negative evaluations, harassment, and change in hours.  Adverse actions are not limited to situations in 
which a person is currently employed by a given or ganization. In addition, adverse actions can take 
place after an individual is no longer with a co mpany. Examples of post-employment retaliation 
include giving an unjustified negative job reference, refusing to provide a job reference, or informing an individual’s prospective employer about the individual’s protected activity. 
Causal Connection 
To establish a causal connection between the protect ed activity and the adverse action, an employee 
may, for example, provide evidence that the day afte r she testified against her employer in a racial 
discrimination case, she received a demotion and was transferred to a new location. 
Types of Retaliation Claims  
Retaliation allegations are most frequently made in  conjunction with claims alleging discrimination 
on the basis of bringing in a protected category of persons. Examples of these categories include gender, race, or national origin discrimination. In  addition, retaliation is also commonly alleged under 
a variety of other circumstances, including retaliati on claims made in conjunction with a claim of 
sexual harassment or wrongful termination and/or in response to an employee’s making a claim under a state workers compensation law.  
“Whistle-Blower” Claims 
 Retaliation claims can also be br ought independently by people who are not in a protected category, 
based on an assertion that the person was penalized fo r complaining of or opposing certain employer 
actions (e.g., billing practices on a government contract ), refusing to engage in illegal or unethical 
conduct, or exposing such conduct via testimony at a tr ial or administrative hear ing. Such claims are a 
subcategory of retaliation claims and are sometimes called “whistle-blower” claims. 
Inappropriate Workplace Conduct  
In some instances, work-related claims are made  that do not allege discrimination, wrongful 
termination, sexual harass ment, or retaliation.  
Claims alleging inappropriate workplace conduct sometimes produce even larger damage awards and settlements than do claims of wrongful termination, discrimination, sexual har assment, or retaliation. 
This is because compensation is not merely based onl y on the plaintiff’s loss of salary (as is the case 
with these four types of claims), but also on the extent of personal injury resulting from the inappropriate conduct, usually including emotional distress damages, whic h, in some claims is alleged 
to have caused actual physical inju ry, such as a heart attack or a stroke. Additionally, in some states 
punitive damages can be awarded for successful claims of inappropriate workplace conduct.  
Exhibit 3.1 provides a listing of the most common a llegations that constitute inappropriate workplace 
conduct. They are discussed in more detail, in the pages that follow. 
 
  Chapter 3–Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 2) 
13 Exhibit 3.1 
Representative Inappropriate Workplace Conduct 
• Assault and battery 
• Defamation  
• Invasion of privacy 
• Fraud, misrepresentation 
• Negligence 
• Infliction of emotional distress 
• Bullying 
• Breach of an employment contract  
• Coercion  
• Wrongful failure to employ  
• Wrongful failure to promote  
• Wrongful discipline  
• Wrongful deprivation of a career opportunity  
• Wrongful failure to grant tenure  
• Negligent evaluation  
Assault and Battery  
The tort of assault is an intentional act by one pe rson that causes a second person to legitimately fear 
harmful or unwanted contact by the first, althoug h there is no actual physical contact between the 
two. In contrast, the tort of battery is the inten tional act of touching another person in a harmful or 
offensive manner. Assault and battery claims usua lly arise in the employment context when an 
employee files a sexual harassment claim.  
Defamation  
Defamation, which is an untrue statement about a person, can be written (libel) or oral (slander). A 
defamatory statement must be communicated to a th ird person to give rise to a claim. A statement 
(written or oral) made by one person to anothe r does not constitute defamation unless at least one 
other person becomes aware of the statement.  
Defamation claims most commonly arise during di sputes following employee terminations. In this 
situation, the employee will allege that his or her professional reputation was damaged as a result of 
false comments made to colleagues by supervis ors or managers, following the termination. 
Defamation claims also ar ise when the former employer is asked  to give a reference about the ex-
employee, and the former employer provides derogatory information. (It is therefore, recommended 
that employers only provide objective reference information that confirms the employer’s wage rate, 
dates of employment, and job requirements.) Less common are defamation claims that result when an employee is demoted or sanctioned in some other wa y, on the basis of a false accusation by another 
employee. (While it should be recognized that trut h is a defense to defamation claims, even true 
statements or information, if disclosed with mali cious intent, can be valid grounds for a defamation 
claim.) Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
14 Invasion of Privacy  
Invasion of privacy claims are produced by a number of situations.  
Intrusion into Non-Work-Related Personal Affairs 
An employee can recover damages if an employer unreasonably intrudes into his or her personal 
affairs, or when his or her termination is based  on behavior that occurred away from the workplace 
and had nothing to do with the employment itself. An employer could, however, legally terminate an employee for a felony conviction, if it could be show n that the conduct producing that conviction was 
related to the nature of the employee’s job. For example, a school could likely terminate a teacher who was convicted of indecency with a minor, but not necessarily if the conviction was for writing a bad check.  
Divulging of Private Information 
Invasion of privacy claims can also arise if an employer divulges information concerning the 
employee to third parties, even though the informati on is true. Additionally, if the employer disclosed 
private or confidential information about an empl oyee to other parties who do not have legitimate 
business reason to have access to such information, th e employer may be found liable for invasion of 
privacy, such as providing information contained in an employee’s personnel file, medical records, or drug or polygraph test results. 
Unreasonable Search of Pe rsonal Property/Premises  
Other claims can involve unreasonable searches  of an employee’s possessions or places where the 
employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Such  claims arise if the intrusion would be highly 
offensive to a “reasonable person.” In one case, an  employer searched an employee’s locker, which 
was secured with a personal lock. The search was held to constitute an invasion of privacy because the employer did not maintain a policy allowing acces s to the employees’ lockers. (However, if the 
employer reserves the right to search lockers under suspicion of improper employee conduct, a court likely will not find an expectation of privacy.) 
Negligent Release of Financia l, Identity-Related Data  
Identity theft conjures up images of hackers prying into the personal computers of unsuspecting targets, or of thieves combing through the mailbox es and garbage cans of unwary victims. But one of 
the least considered sources of the data needed to commit identity theft are records kept by corporate 
human resources departments. The misuse of such information creates a significant exposure for employers because victimized employees can claim that  their privacy was violated and/or that the 
employer committed a breach of confidentiality in  allowing such information to be accessible and 
subsequently misused.  
Moreover, employees could also allege that a corporation failed to protect confidential data, even in 
the absence of identity theft. For example, an employee in the human resources department who holds 
a grudge against another employee gains access to confidential, adverse financial or medical 
information about the coworker. The employ ee then passes it along to fellow employees.  
Fraud/Misrepresentation  
An employer may incur liability for unfounded promises made in forming the employment 
relationship.  Chapter 3–Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 2) 
15 When Fraud/Misrepresentation Occurs 
A misrepresentation claim typically arises in two cases: (1) when an employee does not change 
employers based on misrepresentations made by his or her current employer and thereby misses out on a favorable opportunity with another employer ; and (2) when an employee changes employers 
based on the misrepresentations made by a prosp ective employer, thereby leaving an otherwise 
advantageous position.  
How Fraud/Misrepres entation Occurs 
Promises made during hiring negotia tions may form the basis for a fraud or misrepresentation claim. 
To prevail under this cause of action, the employ ee must prove that (1) the employer made a false 
representation to the employee, (2) the employer kn ew that the representation was false or had the 
means or duty to know that it was false, and (3) the employee justifiably relied on the 
misrepresentations to his or her detriment. In addition, as noted above, fraud/misrepresentation may 
occur when statements or promises (e.g., a specific salary increase or promotion), are made to an existing employee, as an inducement to remain with an organization, when in fact, the employer had no intention of honoring such promises.  
Negligence  
Negligence is now a common claim type in the employment arena. Workplace-related negligence 
claims (as is true of all negligence claims) are b ased on the following four elements: (1) a duty owed, 
(2) a breach of that duty, (3) damages, and (4) dir ectly caused by a breach of that duty. For instance, 
if an employer steadfastly refuses to provide an employee with protective equipment and the 
employee is injured as a direct result of such refusal, the employee (in certain states) would have a 
valid claim of negligence against the employer , because the employer breached a common law duty 
to provide a safe workplace and the employee was injured as a result.  
Negligent Hiring, Training, or Supervision 
Negligence claims often seek to impose liability on an employer for wrongful acts of supervisors or other employees—alleging that the employer is ch arged with the negligent hiring, training, or 
supervision of an employee. Several negligent hi ring cases have held that employers have an 
affirmative duty to investigate an  applicant’s employment history, to determine if there is any reason 
not to hire the applicant. These suits have usua lly arisen following incidents of violence or 
harassment, wherein the injured employee mainta ins that the employer knew—or should have 
known—that another employee had a history of violence in the workplace or of sexual harassment, but failed to protect the other employees.  
Negligent Retention 
Negligent retention cases arise when an employer fails to discharge an employee who management knew, or should have known, had a propensity toward violence or sexual harassment, and that 
employee causes injury to another person. 
Intentional or Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress  
Allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are difficult to prove, because most states require the plaintiff to show extreme and outrageous  conduct on the part of the employer. States vary, 
however, on what constitutes “outrageous conduct, ” so employers should steer clear of any 
unnecessary behavior that would humiliate or embarrass an employee. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
16 Bullying 
Bullying is considered to involve one person harassi ng another and is characterized by a pattern of 
deliberate, hurtful, and menacing behaviors. It can have two aspects: 
Physical —making intimidating physical threats, pushing, shoving, invading an 
individual's personal space, or 
Psychological —psychological violence that is mostly covert, including joking or 
initiation rites that may mask sadistic behavior. 
Other commentators have attempted to define “bul lying” conduct in terms of certain intentional 
behaviors, including the following. 
• Staring or glaring in a hostile manner  
• Treating another in a rude, demeaning, or disrespectful manner  
• Interfering or sabotaging work activities  
• Shunning or otherwise giving some one the “silent treatment” 
• Failing to give, or giving little, pr ofessional feedback on performance  
• Withholding of critical information necessary for work performance  
• Lying or misrepresentation regarding workpl ace assignments, events, or opportunities  
• Preventing or impeding an individual from expressing himself or herself.  
While this list of behaviors is not all-inclusive, bullying is a type of behavior that intimidates, 
humiliates, or undermines a person and that is repeat ed over time. And, importantly, the bully can be 
a supervisor or co-employee. 
Breach of an Employment Contract  
Employee allegations that an employer has breached the terms of an employment agreement are of 
two basic types.  
Breach of a Written Employment Contract 
Claims asserting breach of a written contract are generally triggered by an employee’s termination in which it is alleged that the terms of the contr act prohibit termination without cause and that the 
employee’s termination was without sufficient cause. Such contracts are almost always for a specific 
number of years and compensation for that period is also specifically indicated. 
As will be noted in the coverage section of th is course, virtually no EPL policies cover damages 
associated with written employment contracts and only a handful cover defense costs involving 
assertions that an employer breached a written employment contract. 
Breach of an Implied Employment Contract 
Claims asserting breach of an implied contract of employment usually assert that a contract was established by an offer letter, statements in  an employee handbook, statements made by a 
manager/supervisor, or as a result of an employee’s tenure with a company.  Chapter 3–Common Law EPL Exposures (Part 2) 
17 As will be noted in the coverage section of this  course, most, but not all EPL policies cover damages 
associated with implied employment contracts and virtually all cover defense costs involving such 
claims. 
Coercion  
Claims alleging coercion are those in which an employ er attempts to force an employee to engage in 
knowingly illegal conduct. For example, this mi ght involve a demand that an employee provide 
testimony in a court of law that the employee knows to be false. Or, coercion could take the form of 
pressuring an employee into intentional overbilling on a government contract.  
Wrongful Failure To Employ  
Such claims (which are also sometimes combined w ith discrimination claims) allege that an employer 
refused to hire an applicant who is qualified to perform a specific job.  
Wrongful Failure To Promote  
Claims alleging wrongful failure to promote (which  again, are often combined with discrimination 
claims) assert that a qualified employee was denied a promotion. 
Wrongful Discipline  
Claims of wrongful discipline assert either that (1) an employee was disciplined for an infraction that did not occur, or (2) if the employee did commit th e infraction, that the discipline meted out for the 
infraction was excessive.  
Wrongful Deprivation of a Career Opportunity  
Claims alleging wrongful deprivation of a career oppor tunity most often involve a failure to provide 
specific types of training that will advance an employee’s career. For example, if a first-line 
supervisor is not permitted to enroll in a course for managers, this could give rise to such a claim.  
Wrongful Failure To Grant Tenure  
Wrongful failure to grant tenure claims are typically  made in college or university settings, whereby a 
professor claims to have been denied tenure, desp ite having met all of the requirements for tenure.  
Negligent Evaluation  
Negligent evaluation claims generally assert th at an employee’s performance evaluation was 
excessively negative and therefore did not reflect the employee’s actual level of performance.

21 Chapter 4 
Statutory Law EPL Exposures 
Chapter 4 will examine the key statutes that form the basis for a substantial number of employment-
related claims. 
In the United States, a great deal of employment-re lated litigation is brought under the federal statutes 
enacted to protect against discriminatory acts in the workplace, most significantly Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Americans With 
Disabilities Act (ADA); and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Allegations under these acts are often coupled with numerous individual state civil rights laws. Exhibit 4.1 provides a list of the most important federal statutes related to workplace discrimination. A majority of states 
have also passed legislation similar to these federa l laws, but for the sake of simplicity, this chapter 
will focus on the federal statutes. The more important  statutes are discussed in the pages that follow. 
 
Exhibit 4.1 
Federal Statutes Relating to Workplace Discrimination 
• The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
• The Equal Pay Act of 1963  
• Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  
• Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967  
• The Rehabilitation Act of 1973  
• The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978

    Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
22 The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires most employers in the United States to comply with 
minimum wage and hour standards. Oftentimes, comp arable state laws, such as those in California, 
apply even more stringent requirements. The FLSA 's basic requirements (a) govern the payment of 
overtime wages as respects exempt versus nonexe mpt workers and overtime wages for nonexempt 
employees working more than 40 hours per workweek, (b) specify employment limitations for 
children, and (c) mandate record keeping by employers. 
Exempt versus Nonexempt Employees 
The issue of who is classified as an “exempt” em ployee (i.e., exempt from eligibility for receiving 
overtime pay) versus a nonexempt employee (i.e., one who is eligible for overtime pay), continues to 
cause employers huge headaches. Basi cally, there is an overtime exemption for (1) executives, (2) 
high level administrative employees, (3) professi onals, and (4) outside sales employees under the 
FLSA and under most state labor codes. To be  exempt from eligibility for overtime pay, these 
employees must meet certain tests regarding job duties and responsibilities and be compensated “on a 
salary basis” at not less than stated amounts. Such tests, however, are highly confusing and even 
workers paid on a salary basis can sometimes be eligible for overtime pay.  
Wage and Hour Claims 
Employers throughout the United States are being bo mbarded with lawsuits alleging violation of the 
FLSA, known as “wage and hour claims.” In 2008, Staples paid $38 million—more than $22,000 to 
each “assistant manager” who allegedly was miscla ssified as an exempt employee under overtime 
laws. Starbucks is also in “hot water,” having lost  a class certification ruling to 900 “managers” who 
claim to have been improperly classified as “executives.” 
But wage and hour lawsuits are not limited to large employers or even to class actions. Their impact 
upon smaller companies may be far greater. One employee recovered a six-figure settlement because 
he meticulously documented the time he spent “on call,” as a result of his employer's failure to 
properly utilize time cards. Wage and hour violations are the si ngle largest dollar exposure for 
employers today, far exceeding that from discrimination claims.  
Sources of Wage and Hour Litigation 
Perhaps the most pervasive—and costly—myth associated  with wage and hour claims is that they 
result only because employers fail to pay overtime to “nonexempt employees.” In fact, there are 
numerous additional sources of wage and ho ur claims. These include the following.  
• Misconceptions that if an employer pays someone a salary, he or she is automatically 
classified as “exempt.”  
• Misclassifying employees as independent cont ractors and not paying them overtime.  
• Not properly paying employees for overtime—i.e., compensation for hours worked in excess of 8 hours in a given day or more than 40 hours in a week.  
• Miscalculating the amount of wages owed (i.e., applying the wrong rate, crediting tips, etc.).  
• Not paying qualified employees for time they are “on call.” Chapter 4–Statutory Law EPL Exposures 
23 • Allowing employees to work “off the clock” (i.e ., not paying for time spent for opening tasks 
or closing duties, before and after the official workday, or for time spent donning uniforms, 
attending seminars).  
• Not allowing employees to take meal or rest breaks.  
• Not paying qualified employees for “on call” time or travel time.  
• Not paying employees on a timely basis.  
• Not paying all wages due and owing at the time of termination.  
• Docking exempt employees’ salaries for absences.  
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 
The Equal Pay Act prohibits pay discrimination against employees because of their gender. The Act 
compels businesses to pay equal wages to employees performing “substantially equal jobs,” 
regardless of the sex of the individual employees. “S ubstantially equal jobs” means jobs that require 
equal skill, effort, and responsib ility, and which are performed unde r similar working conditions. Pay 
differentials may be based on merit, seniority, or an y lawful factor other than sex. The Equal Pay Act 
applies to all businesses regardless of the number of employees.  
Damages Recoverable under Equal Pay Act  
The Equal Pay Act provides for the recovery of the difference in pay, back pay, attorneys fees, and 
costs. If the court finds that the employer’s c onduct was willful, it may double the damages award, 
unless the employer demonstrates that it acted in a sincere and reasonable belief that its conduct was 
lawful. Also, awards generally are limited to 2 years, but if the court determines that the violation was 
willful, then the back pay award may be extended to 3 years. 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, whic h was as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
prohibits discrimination by private sector employer s. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 broadened Title 
VII to allow aggrieved employees the right to a jury  trial and the right to recover compensatory and 
punitive damages. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, successful claimants were entitled only to 
awards of back pay and benefits. 
Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminati ng on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin in hiring, discharge, compensation, and any terms, conditions, or privileges of 
employment.  
Application of Title VII 
An “employer” is defined under Title VII as any pe rson “engaged in an industry affecting commerce 
who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.” An “employer”  can be a sole proprietor, partnership, or 
corporation. A partner is not considered an employee under Title VII. (Although Title VII only 
applies to employers with 15 or more workers, state or local laws against discrimination, depending on jurisdiction, may apply to employers of fewer workers.) Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
24 Definition of “Agent”: Indivi dual Supervisor Liability  
The definition of “employer” also includes any “agent”  of the employer. For years, a debate has raged 
as to whether the inclusion of the term “agent” in the definition of “employer” was meant to impose 
individual liability on supervisors, including directors and officers. 
The Majority Rule 
The majority of federal courts today, following the case of Miller v. Maxwell's Int'l Inc. , do not 
interpret the term “agent” as crea ting individual liability on the part of supervisors and directors and 
officers. Rather, the courts following Miller find the term “agent” was included to ensure an employer 
could be held liable for the acts of its agents.  
The Minority Rule 
A minority of federal courts hold that a supervisor may be personally liable for discriminatory acts. 
The leading case is Cross v. Alabama , where the court ruled that supervisors who engage in 
discriminatory acts, and who have actual authorit y to hire and fire employees, are “employers” 
themselves under Title VII and therefore are subject to personal liability. 
Potential Damages  
Successful Title VII claimants can receive reinstatem ent or front pay (i.e., future wages); back pay 
(i.e., past wages); attorneys fees; an injunction against the prohibited discrimination; damages for 
pain, suffering, and mental anguish; and punitive damages. 
Damage Caps 
Damages for pain, suffering, mental anguish, and punitive damages are available only to victims of 
intentional discrimination and are subject to the following caps, based on the employer’s workforce 
size.  
15 to 100 employees $ 50,000 
101 to 200 employees $100,000
201 to 500 employees $200,000
501 employees or more $300,000
In cases involving multiple claimants, each successful claimant is subject to a separate cap. The above 
caps do not affect the amount of back pay, front pa y, attorneys fees, or interest on back pay that a 
successful claimant may collect. 
Effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 
This Act broadened claimants' rights under Title VII. While previously limited to a bench trial (i.e., a trial before a judge), as a result of this law, plain tiffs now have the right to have their case heard by a 
jury. Jury trials potentially increase an employer’s ex posure, because most juries tend to identify with, 
and thus favor the employee, and generally  award larger verdicts than do judges. Chapter 4–Statutory Law EPL Exposures 
25 Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), bars employers from discriminating 
against employees over the age of 40 on the basis of age with regard to hiring, discharge, 
compensation, and other terms, conditions, or  privileges of employment. Under the ADEA, 
employers are prohibited from (1) failing or refusing to hire, discharging, or discriminating in the 
compensation of an individual because of age;  (2) depriving an individual of employment 
opportunities or otherwise adversely affecting the employee’s status because of age; or (3) reducing an individual’s wages to eliminate a wage discrep ancy that might violate the ADEA. Employers may 
not retaliate against an employee for asserting righ ts protected by the ADEA or publish any notice or 
advertisement that expresses any age preference or limitation. 
As with Title VII and the ADA, a majority of cour ts hold there is no individual personal liability for 
supervisors under the ADEA.  
Application of ADEA 
The ADEA protects workers employed in a business th at has 20 or more employees for each working 
day, for 20 or more calendar weeks in the year.  
Potential Damages  
Successful plaintiffs under the ADEA are entitled to b ack pay, benefits, interest, attorneys fees and 
costs, and front pay if they are not reinstated. If the employer is found to have willfully violated the 
ADEA, the wronged employee is also entitled to liqui dated damages in an amount equal to the award 
for back pay and benefits.(Liquidated damages are those that are specifically stated or quantified, usually prior to the signing of a contract or agreem ent. In this instance, liquidated damages refers to 
the actual amount of wages lost from the time of the wrongful termination based on age discrimination until adjudication of the claim by a court or by a settlement.)  
Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Lo wers the Standard of Proof. 
Employees’ chances of winning age discrimination suits have improved based on the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s 2000 ruling in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing . Here, a 57-year-old factory supervisor was 
fired when declining production at the company was blamed on poor attendance by employees for 
whom the supervisor was responsible. Yet when company records revealed no attendance problems, 
the plaintiff, who shared the responsibility of ma intaining attendance records with a 35-year-old, was 
fired. The 35-year-old was not fired. By ruling in  plaintiff’s favor, the court decided that an age 
discrimination plaintiff need only rely on merely ci rcumstantial rather than direct evidence to prove 
his/her case. As a result, age discrimination can be inferred based on an employer’s false explanation 
for termination, without other specific proof of age discrimination, such as derogatory comments 
about the employee’s age, physical conditi on, or appearance based on his/her age. 
The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) 
The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), forbids employers from discriminating against a “qualified individual” with a “disability” when th e discrimination is based on the individual’s 
disability. A “qualified individual” is “an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable 
accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual 
holds or desires.”  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
26 The Two Key Requirements 
The ADA imposes two broad requirements: (1) equal opportunity and (2) reasonable accommodation. 
Equal opportunity compels an employer to hire a job applicant, regardless of any disability, provided 
he or she possesses the requisite sills, education, and experience to handle the duties of the position. 
An employer is obligated to provide “reasonabl e accommodation” that will allow disabled employees 
to perform essential job functions. An employer is required to make “reasonable accommodations” 
for a disabled employee or applicant if doing so  imposes no “undue hardship” on the employer. For 
example, if a small business with $250,000 in an nual revenues was required to install a special 
elevator ramp costing $10,000 to accommodate a disa bled employee, this would likely be considered 
an undue hardship. On the other hand, this same  expenditure by a company with $25 million in 
annual revenues, would not.  
Definition of “Disability” 
The ADA defines “disability” as (1) a physical or ment al impairment that subs tantially limits one or 
more of the major life activities of an individual; (2) a record of such an  impairment; or (3) the 
perception that an individual has an impairment . The ADA extends the term “disability” to diseases 
such as epilepsy, tuberculosis, and AIDS, but do es not protect individuals with addictions to 
controlled substances. Employers, however, may ba r individuals with specified contagious diseases 
(not including AIDS) from handling or preparing food. 
One of the problems inherent in the ADA is th at the law considers a number of questionable 
conditions as protected “disabilities.” For example, mental and psychiatric impairments are defined 
disabilities within the ADA. Accordingly, employ ee-claimants sometimes allege that certain 
undesirable traits associated with these conditions—w hich are not generally considered “disabilities” 
(i.e., chronic lateness, hostility to coworkers and s upervisors) are protected mental or psychological 
impairments. 
Definition of “Reasonable Accommodation” 
Under the ADA, employers must provide a “reasona ble accommodation” to qualified individuals with 
a disability in three areas: (1) to permit an employee to perform the essential functions of the job; (2) 
to create fairness in testing and applications procedures; and (3) to permit a disabled individual to 
enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment that are at least substantially equal to those benefits 
and privileges afforded to similarly situated nondisabled individuals.  
Examples of “reasonable accommodation” include making offices accessible to persons with 
disabilities, modifying job descriptions, providing fl exible work schedules, reassignment, or other 
workplace adjustments that the employer can acco mplish without undue hardship. “Undue hardship” 
means an accommodation that would cause undue hardship or expense when considered in light of such factors as the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, the overall financial resources of the employer, and the nature of the employer’s business. 
ADA Application 
The ADA applies to employers with 15 or more employees who are employed for the current or preceding year for 20 or more calendar weeks. As wi th Title VII, a debate exists among the federal 
circuits as to whether individual supervisors may be  held individually and personally liable under the 
ADA. Again, the majority rule is that th ere is no individual lia bility under the ADA. Chapter 4–Statutory Law EPL Exposures 
27 Potential Damages  
A plaintiff filing suit under the ADA has the right to demand a jury trial. A successful claimant under 
the ADA may obtain reinstatement; back pay and be nefits; attorneys fees; expert witness fees; 
damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish; and punitive damages. Compensatory and punitive 
damage awards are subject to the same caps as Title  VII claims. However, if the employer, in good 
faith and in consultation with the disabled employ ee, attempts to identify and make a reasonable 
accommodation, the court may not award compensatory and punitive damages. In its discretion, the 
court may order an employer to afford  an employee a reasonable accommodation. 
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows employees, in certain circumstances, to take 
unpaid leave from work to care for themselves or clos e (i.e., parent, child; but not first cousin) family 
members. 
Application of FMLA  
The Act requires businesses with 50 or more empl oyees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-
protected leave to eligible employees for qualified family and medical emergencies. An employee is 
eligible only if (1) the employer has at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee’s work site; (2) he or she has worked for any covered employer for a minimum of 1 year; and (3) the employee has worked for his or her current employer for a minimum of 1,250 hours during the preceding year. 
An employee seeking leave is required to provide 30 days’ advance notice to his or her employer 
when the leave is foreseeable, su ch as for childbirth or adoption. The employer can ask that the 
employee comply with the company's standard pro cedure for obtaining leave, although medical leave 
may not be denied because the employee fails to follow the proper procedures. 
The Problem of Intermittent Leave 
Under the law, employees are allowed to take wh at is known as intermittent leave. According to 
Department of Labor regulations, there is no minimum limit on the time period associated with a 
leave and, in fact, leave can be taken in one-minute increments! Human resources professionals routinely cite this as one of the greatest challeng es under the Act because tracking intermittent leave 
is so tedious.  
The Problem of Chronic Conditions 
The greatest intermittent leave challenge is dealing with chronic conditions such as diabetes, migraine 
headaches, depression, and asthma, whereby, an employee typically requests leave without prior 
notice and for only a brief period of time (e.g., a half  hour to lie down during a migraine headache).  
Many HR executives have purchased software program s that track FMLA leave time or have such 
programs built into their human resources management systems (HRMS). Given the difficulty of tracking leave in such small blocks of time, a number of companies and their attorneys have requested of the Department of Labor that intermittent leave be allowed on no less than a half-day basis, and not 
in minutes, as is currently permitted. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
28 Damages Recoverable under FMLA  
Employees may enforce their rights under the FMLA in federal court or through the United States 
Department of Labor, and if successful, may recei ve money damages and attorneys' fees and cash, as 
well as equitable relief, including reinstatement and promotion. Even an employee who has not 
suffered any lost wages because of a violation may recover monetary damages sustained as a direct 
result of the violation, such as child care or nursing  care up to a sum equal to 12 weeks of pay. The 
court may double damages if it finds the employer intentionally violated the FMLA. 
The Uniformed Services Employ ment and Reemployment Rights 
Act (USERRA) of 1994 
USERRA, which was signed into law on October 13,  1994, is intended to minimize the disadvantages 
to an individual that occur when that person needs to be absent from his or her civilian employment to 
serve in this country’s uniformed services. Speci fically, USERRA provides for a cumulative 5-year 
time period during which a person may be absent from work for uniformed services duty and still 
retain reemployment rights.  
What is the Magnitude of the Exposure? 
The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with the requirements of USERRA, have created a 
significant liability exposure for employers.  
According to the Department of Defense, fro m September 2001 through November 30, 2007, 254,894 
National Guard and 202,113 Army, Navy, Marines,  and Air Force Reserve personnel have been 
deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Admittedly, a lo w percentage of situations involving the assertion 
of USERRA rights end up in court. Nevertheless, given the fact that nearly half a million people have 
served in these operations, the magnitude of this exposure, given the sheer number of potential 
plaintiffs it has created, is still apparent.  
As reported by the New York Times on June 21, 2008 (“After Duty, New Chance for Old Job”), a 
verdict rendered in favor of a reservist, who was de nied his old job upon returning from Iraq, directly 
addressed this exposure. The case highlighted the difficult issues surrounding reemployment of 
National Guard and Reserve personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
The Purpose of USERRA 
The law attempts to encourage non-career unifo rmed service (i.e., in the National Guard and 
Reserves), so that America can enjoy the protection of those services, staffed by qualified people, while balancing the needs of private and pub lic employers who also depend on these same 
individuals.  
Who is Covered by USERRA? 
USERRA potentially covers every individual in the country who serves or has served in the 
uniformed services. The Act applies to employers in  the public and private sectors, including federal 
employers. The term “uniformed services” means the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard, and 
the Air National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty; the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service; and any other category of persons designated by the president in time of war or emergency. Chapter 4–Statutory Law EPL Exposures 
29 Employer Eligibility 
A key point associated with USERRA is that all empl oyers are subject to it—regardless of their size.  
Employee Eligibility 
To be eligible for USERRA rights, employees must: 
1. Have held a civilian job prior to their service in the uniformed services,  
2. Have given notice to their employer that they were leaving the job for uniformed service,  
3. Have been in uniformed service for no longer than a cumulative total of 5 years during their 
employment,  
4. Not be released from uniformed service under di shonorable or other punitive conditions, and  
5. Apply for reemployment within specified time limits after return.  
Advance Notice Requirements 
The law requires all employees to provide their empl oyers with advance notice of military service. 
This advance notice includes a reasonable time peri od with which to leave for home to prepare for 
service.  
An Employee's Rights upon Returning to Work 
The rights to which returning employees are entitled under the USERRA are subject to the “escalator 
principle.” This principle requires returning employ ees to be treated as if they had been continuously 
employed. They must be reemployed in the job that they would have attained had they not been 
absent for uniformed service. This may require that  the employer train the returning employee to 
enable him or her to function in a new position. Retu rning employees must also receive the seniority, 
status, pay, and other benefits to which they wo uld have been entitled had they not gone on leave. 
When Reemployment is Excused  
An employer is not required to reemploy a service man or woman when: (1) the employer 
experiences “changed circumstances” and (2) when there is “undue hardship.”  
Changed Circumstances 
Reemployment of a person is excused if an empl oyer’s circumstances have changed so much that 
reemployment of the person would be impossi ble or unreasonable. A company-wide layoff or 
“reduction in force,” that would have included the person, is an example of changed circumstances. 
Undue Hardship 
As is also the case with the ADA, employers are excused from making efforts to return service 
members to their previous jobs or from acco mmodating individuals with service-connected 
disabilities when doing so would be of such difficult y or expense as to cause “undue hardship” to the 
employer.  
   Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
30 The Genetic Information Nondi scrimination Act of 2008 
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, also referred to as GINA, is designed to 
prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment. The Act, which 
will become effective November 21, 2009, prohibits group health plans and health insurers from 
denying coverage to a healthy individual or char ging that person higher premiums based solely on a 
genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The legislation also bars employers from 
using individuals’ genetic information when ma king hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion 
decisions.  
Application of GINA 
Here is an example of how the law might apply in an employment scenario. A company requires pre-employment physicals as a condition of employme nt. The results of a prospective employee’s 
physical indicate that she is healthy and fully cap able of performing the job duties for the particular 
position she had been hired. However, during the course of the examination it is also revealed that she 
has a genetic predisposition to deve loping breast cancer. As a result of the law, the employer would 
not be able to deny the person the job, despite such a predisposition. 
Liability under State and Local Statutes 
Aggrieved employees also can seek protection under st ate and local antidiscrimination statutes similar 
to the federal statutes discussed above, including fa ir employment practices laws and whistle-blower 
statutes. 
Fair Employment Practices Laws  
Every state has enacted Fair Employment Practices (FEP) legislation, which bars discrimination by 
private employers against defined categories of indi viduals. The FEP laws are generally broader than 
their federal counterparts but are not uniform in their protection. For example, several states protect 
marital status, and a small but growing number of st ates protect sexual orientation. As already noted, 
some local fair employment laws are broader than corresponding federal statutes. This has the effect 
of subjecting small businesses to local laws, even  though they are not bound by federal statutes. 
Often, aggrieved employees will bring claims under local laws, as a result.  
Whistle-Blower Statutes  
The federal government protects employees from retaliatory actions by their employer when the employees report violations of any law on the part of their employer. Many states also have passed 
laws prohibiting an employer from firing or otherw ise retaliating against an employee for disclosing 
an unfair or illegal practice by the employer.  
Public Policy Protection 
Many state courts have created common law remedies that protect employees from termination or 
retaliation for exercising their legal rights. Employ ees discharged or retaliated against for exercising 
their rights may sue their employer for damages. Courts generally justify this exception to the at-will 
employment rule on the basis of “public policy,” holding that an employee should not be discharged for exercising rights under other laws that were enacted to protect the employee.

When Personnel accidentally sent Victoria the pa ycheck addressed to Victor, she noticed that 
he had been receiving higher wages for doing exactly the same work. Having discovered this 
secret, she learned that other male employees were also better compensated. Victoria then 
sued her employer under the Equal Pay Act of  1963. If the suit is successful, Victoria may 
recover all the following as damages, except: 
a. 2 years’ back pay. 
b. doubled damages if the court finds th e employer’s conduct was willful.  
c. her boss’s job. 
d. the difference in pay. 
3. He-Man Corporation has 250 employees. Ten female employees convinced the court that He-
Man had discriminated against them on the basis of their gender, but the courts agreed with He-Man that the discrimination was not intenti onal. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 
the total amount of damages that may be awar ded for pain, suffering, mental anguish, and 
punitive damages 
a. Is $0.

35 Chapter 5 
Rating and Underwriting Employment Practices Liability Coverage 
Chapter 5 discusses the factors that are considered in developing rates for EPLI coverage. 
The Rating Basis for EPLI Policies 
Employment practices liability insurance policies are generally rated on a cost “per employee” basis. 
To develop a total premium, underwriters first de termine a “per employee” rate and then multiply it 
by the number of covered employees under the policy.  
The factors used in developing rates for EPLI polici es are noted in Exhibit 5.1 and explained in the 
pages that follow. 
 
Exhibit 5.1 
Employment Practices Liability Rating Factors 
• Jurisdiction  
• Industry  
• Number of employees  
• Leased employees 
• Union employees 
• Profitability  
• Mix of exempt/nonexempt employees  
• Leased employees 
• Union employees 
• Claim history  
• Written procedures  
• Termination and turnover rates  
• Plans for staff reductions and layoffs  
• Corporate culture  
Jurisdiction  
Location is the single most important factor affecting premiums, given the disparity in claim susceptibility and severity from state to state. Substa ntial jury verdicts have been recorded in Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
36 California (where more than one-third of all EPL claims are made), Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, 
and Texas, a fact that accounts for considerable statewide variation in EPL rates. 
Mix of Locations 
Underwriters also consider the numbe r of locations at which an insured operates. This is an important 
factor because the greater the geographical dispersion, the more difficult it is to implement and monitor loss control policies and procedures within a corporation. Larger, decentralized firms pose a greater risk of claim frequency and severity (tha n do single location businesses) and are surcharged 
accordingly Enforcing safety rules would be more di fficult than if the contractor worked at only a 
single location. The company might be surcharged as a result.  
Industry 
Industry is the second most important factor a ffecting EPL policy premiums. Firms in certain 
industries are more susceptible to being sued and for being subjected to substantial judgments. For 
example, under the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) employment-related practices liability policy's rating plan, coal mining risks are surcharg ed, whereas agricultural operations receive a credit. 
Number of Employees 
Not only does the number of employees provide an in dication of the number of potential plaintiffs, it 
is also significant because larger organizations are more likely to be sued than smaller ones. There are 
three reasons for this.  
Higher Standards of Claim Prevention 
First, courts tend to hold larger firms to higher standards of claim prevention, compared to smaller 
organizations. Whether one agrees with such reasoning or not, the thinking is that such firms have 
greater financial ability to implement fair employment  practices, and as such, they should be held to a 
higher standard, compared to smaller, less financially solid companies.  
Deeper Pockets 
Second, plaintiff's attorneys often target larger firm s when they file lawsuits for two reasons. First, 
because they are more likely than smaller compani es to be insured, thus providing a source of 
settlement proceeds. Second, even if not insured (or insured with a high retention) larger companies 
have the kinds of deep pockets that will produce sizeable settlements or jury verdicts. 
Similarly Situated Employees 
Third, larger firms have greater numbers of similarly situated employees. For example, a Fortune 500 
firm is more likely to employ 1,000 workers in a si ngle plant, doing the same or similar job, than will 
a smaller firm. This makes larger firms more vul nerable to class-action (i.e., multiple plaintiff) 
claims, which, in recent years have yielded a num ber of enormous settlements and judgments against 
major corporations.  
Leased Employees 
Underwriters are also interested in knowing th e number of leased employees maintained by a 
company. Depending on the terms of the lease(s) under which leased employees work, an insured may or may not be responsible for maintaining EPL insurance on such personnel. In cases where the 
insured must purchase such coverage according to the terms of a leasing agreement, the underwriter Chapter 5–Rating and Underwriting Empl oyment Practices Liability Coverage 
37 will add such personnel to the head count when de veloping a premium for the policy. Typically, the 
rate per leased employee is one-third the rate per regular employee. 
Union Employees 
The number of union employees is also an importa nt underwriting consideration. This is because 
union workers are more likely to make a claim than nonunion workers, since the former are more 
“sensitized” to possible causes of action, based upon input from union shop stewards. However, this 
factor is somewhat offset by the fact that claims  associated with grievances related to union contracts 
are excluded by most EPL forms. In addition, many  minor disputes are resolved—without lawsuits—
by agreements between union representatives (i.e., shop stewards) and the employer.  
Profitability  
An employer’s profitab ility and net worth are key underwriti ng issues. Since employees are often 
terminated for financial rather than performance re asons, firms in questionable financial condition are 
much more susceptible to wrongful termination claims compared to companies that have strong 
earnings. This is because layoffs are frequently a co nsequence of financial losses. Thus, financially 
weaker companies often have to pay more for EPLI coverage.  
Profitability Indicators 
When evaluating a company’s profitability, underwr iters consider a number of specific factors.  
Working Capital 
A firm with ample working capital is typically in a better position to avoid layoffs, compared to one 
with less available cash; particularly during economic downturns. Firms lacking such capital may be forced to lay off workers during such periods, despite the fact that they intend to re-hire them when conditions improve. In cont rast, better capitalized companies are not necessarily forced into layoffs 
during slack periods.  
Financial Ratios 
Underwriters also look at key financial ratios (e.g., re turn on equity ratio, current ratio, profit margin). 
Such data also enable an underw riter to assess a firm's likelihood of experiencing financial distress 
and consequent layoffs. This is especially true if th e trends of such ratios are analyzed (i.e., are the 
ratios improving or deteriorating?). 
Age of Firm 
In situations where an insured or applicant for coverage does not show a profit for its most recent 
year, the underwriter often considers the number of  years the company has been in business. In the 
case of a relatively “young” firm (i.e., less than 5 years of operating history), if losses have been 
decreasing, this is a positive sign, which enhances th e firm’s insurability. In  fact, providing coverage 
for an established firm that is beginning to lose money is often more problematical than offering 
coverage to a newer company that has been experiencing losses for some time, but is starting to stabilize financially and therefore does not anticipate future layoffs. 
 
  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
38 Mix of Exempt and Nonexempt Employees  
A high percentage of exempt employees (i.e., those exempt from being eligible to receive overtime 
pay) increases the potential severity and frequency of claims, and thus the rate per employee. Exempt 
employees are likely to earn higher salaries than are nonexempt employees (i.e., those eligible to 
receive overtime pay), thus producing larger in come loss following termination. (Sometimes, 
underwriters apply a separate rate for exempt and nonexempt employees.) In addition, since exempt 
employees tend to be more educated and thus more awar e of their rights, they are also more likely to 
bring claims than are nonexempt workers. 
The “Re-Employment” Factor  
Exempt employees also have an increased likelihoo d of bringing a lawsuit, because it is generally 
more difficult for them to find jobs following te rmination, compared to nonexempt personnel. 
Moreover, once a highly-compensated individual has been terminated, this often makes it harder to 
obtain similar employment, given the stigma associat ed with having been dismissed from a high-level 
position. Finally, such employees, given the condition of  their finances, can often hold out longer than 
rank-and-file employees and can resist initial settlement offers by their former employer, thus enhancing their ability to con tinue the litigation process.  
Claim History  
Underwriters often surcharge (or even reject) firm s with a history of employment-related litigation. 
However, prior claims are not necessarily grounds for rejection, especially if an organization has addressed the causes of such claims and has taken meaningful, effective action to prevent similar allegations in the future. On the other hand, an underwriter would, for example, be leery about a company applying for EPL coverage in which one of  its officers was sued for sexual harassment and 
the company agreed to a substantial settlement—o f a magnitude indicating more than mere nuisance 
value and hence culpability—and the officer remained  with the organization following the settlement. 
Written Procedures  
Underwriters carefully evaluate a company’s wr itten procedures regarding employment practices.  
Policies are Helpful in Defending Claims 
Although written employment procedures may not necessarily prevent claims, they are nevertheless helpful in defending against them (provided th e company has followed those procedures). For 
example, the existence of detailed performance re views indicating a terminated employee's specific 
performance shortcomings, along with evidence that the company has given the employee ample opportunity to rectify these deficiencies (e.g., cau tions, oral warnings, written warnings, probation), 
will make it easier to refute allegations  of discrimination-based termination.  
Critical Policy Areas to Address 
Key corporate policies should address the following ar eas: salary administration, employee benefits, 
employment-at-will statements, performance appraisal, discipline, discharge, interviewing, hiring, 
work assignments, postemployment offers of medi cal coverage, providing references, grievance 
procedures, discrimination polic ies, and sexual harassment. Chapter 5–Rating and Underwriting Empl oyment Practices Liability Coverage 
39 Promulgation and Enforcement of Pr ocedures is Most Important  
It should be mentioned that firms not having such  procedures are now the exception rather than the 
rule. This is because within the past 5 years such  materials have become widely available from a 
number of sources, yet employment-related claim act ivity shows no signs of abating. Indeed, a 
company’s failure to have such materials available would send up an immediate red flag for most 
underwriters. Accordingly, underwriters are particularly concerned about the extent to which such policies are disseminated and enforced. Simply havi ng such documents in a personnel manual is of 
little value in preventing claims if the “spirit” underlying these documents is not promoted throughout 
a company. 
Turnover and Termination Rates 
Underwriters carefully assess turnover and terminatio n rates since unfavorable trends could indicate 
employee morale and/or management problems. High turnover and termination rates also create a 
large potential plaintiff group that could bring claims  against the insured in the future, after coverage 
is bound.  
Nevertheless, these rates must be evaluated in light of two mitigating factors: (1) the rate of voluntary 
versus involuntary turnover and termination and (2) the extent to which the “seasonal” nature (if any) 
of the business affects turnover and termination rates.  
Management Stability 
One important consideration as it relates to turn over and termination is the extent to which a 
company’s senior management has changed in recent y ears. Management stability is usually a sign of 
a well-run and typically profitable company. Conversely, rapid turnover of company executives often 
signals larger problems that sometimes manifest th emselves in losses, and ultimately, a high turnover 
rate among rank-and-file employees, often because of large-scale layoffs. 
Plans for Staff Reductions and Layoffs  
A firm’s immediate plans for layoffs and staff reductions must be ascertained. If a company does plan layoffs within the near future, the underwriter may ex clude claims from such layoffs or, alternatively, 
impose a surcharge, based on th e clear increase in exposure cau sed by these circumstances. 
Corporate Culture 
Although not easily quantified, a company’s culture pl ays a crucial role in determining the likelihood 
of employee claims. For example, firms in which th ere is a high level of trust and communication are 
rarely sued. Despite its importance, an underwriter’s evaluation of an organization’s culture remains a subjective exercise and is difficult to assess.  
Renewal Underwriting: Assessing Change 
When an EPL policy is up for renewal, the key factor that an underwriter considers is the extent to which the insured and its operati ons have changed since the inception of the soon-to-expire policy. 
Among the key items that an underwriter reviews include whether there are/is: 
• New acquisitions 
• Spin-offs of subsidiaries 
• Higher-than-usual termina tion rate of employees Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
40 • Turnover in the company’s HR management group 
• Changes in financial statements 
• Changes in written HR policies 
• Any imminent or planned layoffs

43 Chapter 6 
Employment Practices Liability Loss Control 
Chapter 6 explains how to control the exposures to employment litigation. In addition to preventing 
claims, these approaches will reduce the size of a cl aim, once it is made against an insured. The 
material in this chapter addresses the following topics: 
• Effective hiring 
• Using protective legal documents 
• Reducing risks associated with terminations  
• Preventing claims from providing references 
• Preventing sexual harassment claims  
Effective Hiring  
It can be argued that at least half of all employ ee lawsuits are a direct result of hiring the wrong 
person for a particular job. A corollary to this  statement is the belief among many human resources 
professionals that “good employees don’t sue.” Un fortunately, even companies with elaborate 
personnel policies and procedures hire the wrong peop le. However, if a company (1) tests for skills, 
(2) assesses the candidate’s character/personality, and (3) does a thorough in terview and background 
check, the risk of hiring the wrong person will be vastly reduced. 
Test for Skills  
Companies should not underestimate the value of skills testing. For example, a secretary who types 
60 words per minute, with mistakes, will be less e ffective than a secretary  who types 90 words per 
minute without mistakes. However, if a company fails  to test for typing skills, it will never be aware 
of a prospective employee’s level of ability to pe rform a specific task. Unde r these circumstances, a 
supervisor will criticize the first secretary for lack  of productivity, even when the secretary is putting 
forth her best effort.  
Avoiding Discrimination Allegations Associated with Skills Testing 
Most jobs have a well-defined skill set that can be formally tested. To avoid allegations of 
discriminatory testing, the law only requires that skills  tests be “objective,” “reasonably related to the 
job,” and “validated.” Admittedly, there have been lawsuits claiming that pre-employment tests were 
discriminatory because they had the effect of ex cluding a particular class of persons from a job Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
44 (known as disparate impact discrimination, a c oncept discussed earlier). However, such cases are 
rarely filed, especially against private-sector employers, and then typically against only large 
organizations.  
Weighing the Risk of a Discr imination Lawsuit versus Hiring the Wrong Employee 
Ultimately, a company must weigh the substantial risk  of hiring a poorly qualified worker against the 
relatively low probability of a lawsuit alleging discriminatory testing procedures. Indeed, the damage 
an under-qualified workforce can cause a company is much greater than the low probability of 
lawsuits the firm faces when it uses objective and validated tests that assess the skills and abilities 
required for a particular job. 
Test for Personality/Character 
A wide range of character assessment tools are available on the market today, a number of which have been specifically oriented to hiring. As is also the case with skills testing, there have been 
lawsuits against firms that have used psychological tests. Again, such risks must be weighed against the potential costs associated with hiring the wrong person for a job—lost productivity, reduced morale, missed business opportunities—in addition to the person’s salary.  
Personality Assessments: Ho w High Are the Stakes? 
One indication of the high stakes associated with evaluating prospective management/professional 
employees is provided in Hiring Smart , by Dr. Pierre Mornell, in which he estimates that the cost of 
hiring the wrong employee is two-and-a-half tim es the person’s annual salary—provided the person is 
replaced within 6 months. 
Do Not Use Psychological Test Scores as the Sole Criterion 
One means of reducing the risks associated with lawsuits is not to use a candidate’s scores on 
psychological tests as the sole source of hiring decisions. Rather, such tests should be used as only 
one of several sources of information in evaluati ng a candidate, but not as the sole decision-making 
factor.  
The one exception to this rule is where the company has established predictive validity for the 
particular position under consideration. For example,  assume an auto dealership has used a certain 
personality test for the past decade. Based on such u se, the dealership has found that every successful 
sales person received a specific minimum score on the segment of the test that measures extraversion (i.e., the extent to which a person enjoys interac ting with others). If a candidate for a sales position 
failed to reach this minimum score, it would be bot h appropriate and nondiscriminatory if this person 
were not offered the sales job.  
Interviewing and Background Checking  
Thorough pre-employment interviews and backgrou nd checks, performed in compliance with state 
and federal laws, should be conduc ted. The information obtained from such procedures will be 
valuable in assessing a prospective employee’s track r ecord of previous problems with management 
and history of job turnover during his or her career. 
   Chapter 6–Employment Pract ices Liability Loss Control 
45 Powerful Interview Questions 
There are three powerful interview questions that can  spot problem employees before they are hired. 
Each can be an important “tell” in evaluati ng a job candidate. The questions are as follows. 
• What was it in your last job that felt most unfair?  
• What was it in your last job that excited you the most?  
• What were the three biggest challenges in your last job and how did you overcome them?  
The first question provides insight into whether the applicant is a “self-created” victim who has 
problems accepting responsibility for his or her ac tions and their results. The answer to the second 
question indicates what the potential employer can  hopefully recreate in this job for which the 
candidate is being considered. Finally, the last question provides insight into the person’s problem-
solving style, yet another key factor in evaluating prospective employees. 
Check Criminal, Credit, and Driving History  
Such checks, which can usually be performed by  services specializing in such work for under $100, 
can prevent a number of obvious “horror stories” in the hiring process. Unfortunately, a majority of employers do not take such precautions but suffer ha rsh consequences as a result of this omission.  
Obtaining References on Prospective Employees: Secure Releases from Former 
Employers 
Prior employers are often reluctant to provide detailed, subjective information about previous 
employees. Therefore, when checking the background of a prospective employee, attempt to obtain a 
“Post-Employment Release of Employment Info rmation” Request. When signed by a former 
employee, that person’s former employer is author ized by the former employee to provide detailed 
information about that person’s tenure with the or ganization. But most important, this form releases 
the prior employer from liability cl aims associated with providing th is information. Such a form, a 
standard feature found in human resources software packages, will make it easier to obtain 
meaningful reference information from prospective job candidates. 
Ask the Rehire Question 
Although many firms refuse to release any more than “name, rank, and serial number” despite receiving a release from a former employee, they w ill sometimes answer the following question, the 
response to which is very telling: “Was the employee eligible for rehire at the time he or she left your 
company?” Although a number of HR directors refuse  to provide subjective information about an ex-
employee’s tenure, they will occasionally provide an answer to this all-important but seemingly less-
intrusive question. 
Verify Academic Backgrounds 
The problem of degree fraud was illustrated several years ago when it was revealed that Jayson Blair, a now-former New York Times  reporter, had fabricated many of his articles while working there. In 
his application for employment, Mr. Blair falsely cl aimed to have been awarded a bachelor's degree 
in journalism from the University of Maryland. Unfo rtunately for the Times, no one ever attempted to 
verify the authenticity of Mr. Blair's degree, yet ha d the Times done so, it is likely he would not have 
been hired. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
46 The potential for degree fraud is becoming ever more  likely, given the emergence of Internet-based 
diploma mills that not only print authentic-looking diplomas from reputable, nationally respected 
universities, but also provide transcripts of supposed coursework completed at these institutions.  
An Easy Solution 
The problem of counterfeit diplomas and transcripts  is easily solved. All colleges and universities 
routinely offer students “transcript request forms”  that should be completed by the applicant and 
marked so that the requested transcript will be sent directly to a company’s HR manager—rather than to the former student who is requesting the transcript. This simple step will eliminate virtually all possibility of degree fraud. A company should neve r accept as verification of an academic credential 
or degree a diploma or even a transcript—no matter how official-looking—if they are furnished 
directly by a job candidate.  
Using Protective Legal Documents 
Despite the publicity garnered by large employment -related verdicts, many firms still fail to use 
protective legal documents. Some of the more important ones include “at-will” employment 
agreements, management rights statements, and ag reements in which employees assent to arbitrate 
(rather than litigate) employment-related claims. In  addition, have outside counsel specialized in 
employment law review all employ er-produced, HR-related material. 
Have Employees Sign “At-Will” Employment Agreements 
Both new and current employees should be require d to sign a statement acknowledging that their 
employment is on an “at-will” basis, meaning that they can be terminated for cause or for no cause, at any time, and with no advance notice. As already explained, the “at-will” doctrine is recognized in 
most jurisdictions (although there are certain excepti ons to it, where, in a handful of states, such 
statements are considered contrary to public policy).  
Avoid Implied Promises of “Permanent” Employment 
If a company considers this approach too harsh, the fi rm must at least avoid statements at the time of 
hire or during an employee’s tenure that could be construed as promises of permanent employment. In addition, the employer should make sure that  employees clearly understand (either through signed 
statements or contract provisions) that no oral understandings or promises are incorporated into the employment relationship.  
Audit Employee Handbooks  
Employee handbooks should also be audited to ensure that they contain no statements that could be 
interpreted to guarantee permanent employment. In  effect, employees should be given no assurances 
of continued employment, future promotions, or  specific levels of monetary compensation.  
Include a "Management Rights" Pr ovision in Written Material  
Any written material given to employees, both ne w and existing, should include language reserving 
the right of the organization to modify and inte rpret personnel policies and practices without advance 
notice and at its sole discretion. This is know n as a “management rights” provision and will help to 
defeat claims alleging that the company promised to notify employees of any future changes to the 
employee handbook. Chapter 6–Employment Pract ices Liability Loss Control 
47 Require Employees To Sign Mandatory  Arbitration Agreements  
Binding arbitration agreements, which preclude an employee from suing an employer, and instead 
require that employment disputes be settled by binding arbitration, should be used by most 
employers. Observers agree that the advantages of  arbitration to employers outweigh the potential 
disadvantages. These advantages are noted as follows.  
Avoids the Unpredictability of Juries 
Employers and defense counsel prefer arbitration because it avoids the risk of a so-called runaway 
jury. Since the majority of jurors identify more with an individual employee than with an employer, especially if the employer is a large corporate entity, juries sometimes have a tendency to dispense 
their own brand of justice in the form of an astronom ical award. In contrast, arbitrators usually have a 
better ability than most jurors to understand the reasoning behind legitimate business decisions made by an employer.  
Lower Costs than Litigation 
Compared to a trial, an arbitration proceeding involves less discovery and fewer motions than a typical lawsuit, producing considerable savings in legal fees associated with arbitration.  
Affords Earlier Resolution 
The time between the filing of the claim and the arb itration hearing is usually much shorter than the 
time from the filing of a lawsuit to the trial date. Th e benefit of achieving an early final resolution of 
employment cases, where emotions often run high an d tension in the workplace lingers for some time, 
is extremely important to any company. 
Removes the Dispute from Public Scrutiny 
Most employers want to keep their workplace disputes out of the public fishbowl known as the courtroom. Private arbitration allows that. 
Use Legal Counsel To Review Employer-Produced Material  
All employer-produced written material (e.g., em ployee handbooks, “at-will” statements, arbitration 
agreements, benefits descriptions, and HR policies) should be reviewed by both internal and external 
counsel for possible misleading statements regarding the employer-employee relationship. Ideally, the counsel should specialize in employment law.  
Watch Out for “Contractual Except ions” to the “At-Will” Doctrine 
Frequently, plaintiffs allege that an employee handbook created a contractual exception to the employment-at-will doctrine. Therefore, the handbook should contain a specific and thorough 
disclaimer regarding promises of continued future  employment. The disclaimer should acknowledge 
that the employee is cognizant of his or her at-w ill status, and that the handbook does not intend to 
create contractual rights in favor of the employee.  
Preventing Wrongful Termination Claims 
A number of steps can help to minimize bot h the incidence and se verity of wrongful 
termination claims. These are noted in Exhib it 6.1 and discussed in the paragraphs that 
follow. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
48 Exhibit 6.1 
Preventing Wrongful Termination Claims 
• Conduct periodic performance evaluations  
• Avoid knee-jerk terminations.  
• Consider alternatives to termination  
• Be consistent in making termination decisions 
• Educate and assist managers in the termination process  
• Terminate at the right time and place  
• Use counseling, employee assistance, and outplacement programs  
Conduct Periodic Performance Evaluations  
Conducting periodic performance evaluations that hon estly note deficiencies but give the employee 
opportunity for remedial action is the initial step in preventing wrongful termination claims. 
Performance evaluations should be conducted on a re gular basis (at least once yearly, and quarterly 
for employees who are experiencing difficulties) and follow written procedures developed by management 
Do Not Sidestep Problems 
If performance problems do exist, they should be duly noted at the time of the reviews, rather than sidestepped to avoid conflict. For example, if an employee’s performance is marginal and requires 
significant improvement, he or she should not be give n a rating of “satisfactory” simply to avoid a 
confrontation.  
Record Derogatory Information Carefully 
However, when performance has been  unsatisfactory, managers and s upervisors should be instructed 
on how to properly document personnel files so that especially embarrassing or disparaging remarks do not appear in writing, since these documents are fully discoverable in employment-related litigation. 
Discuss and Document Performance Shortcomings 
Directly addressing such performance deficiencies  is critical because it is difficult to justify 
termination or demotion when a person has received ostensibly adequate ra tings for an extended 
period of time. Rather, shortcomings should be  openly and promptly discussed, and the employee 
given a fair opportunity—within an agreed-upon time frame—to take remedial action.  
To the extent possible, it is advisable to evaluate employees using objective and quantifiable 
performance standards: for example, in the case of a customer service representative, on the basis of 
the number of customers with which he/she interact s per day or the number of customer complaints 
received. (However, this is easier to accomplis h for some positions compared to others.)  
Record the Need for Remedial Steps 
If, after providing fair warning, coupled with a plan for performance improvement, when progress is 
not forthcoming, a manager must consider termina tion. However, by having documented the need for 
remedial action, the organization is in a position to have demonstrated its goo d faith. This will make it 
easier to defend against claims. Indeed, honest, timel y evaluations, coupled with an opportunity for Chapter 6–Employment Pract ices Liability Loss Control 
49 the employee to improve performance, will make it easier to assert that the company opted for 
justifiable termination only as a last resort. 
Performance-Related Terminations  Should Never be a Surprise 
A termination based on poor performance should no t surprise anyone, especially the employee. If the 
employee has been warned, disciplined properly, a nd encouraged to improve his or her performance 
or change his or her conduct, th ere should be little room for surprise when someone is eventually 
terminated. 
Document, Document, Document 
Judges and juries expect to see documentation of p oor performance. Make sure the employee signs 
any performance evaluations or warnings. T horough and objective documentation of poor 
performance guards against claims of ulterior motives such as harassment or discrimination. 
Avoid Knee-Jerk Terminations 
While most employers, as a general rule, fire “too slowly,” sometimes there are circumstances where 
an owner or a manager engages in a “knee-jerk” termination. Not surprisingly, many of these 
terminations end up as lawsuits. Conflict is the breakdown of communication coupled with an 
emotional override. This emotional override can resu lt in poor decision-making. Rather than firing an 
employee during a heated argument, employers should take 5 minutes and go for a walk to cool off.  
Moreover, knee-jerk terminations often violate the terms of a company’s disciplinary procedure, 
making room for affirmative arguments by a sav vy plaintiff’s counsel. If there is a company 
procedure for terminations, it should be followed. 
Consider Alternatives to Termination 
Termination is certainly one answer when an em ployee’s performance is substandard, but not the only 
one. Other alternatives are to restructure the person’s job, move that person to another department or 
location, or demote the employee to a lower pos ition on a temporary or permanent basis. But, as 
already discussed, many employees have filed lawsuits  not just for wrongful termination but also for 
wrongful demotion. Alternatively, consider giving the employee leave without pay so that he or she 
can think over whether he or she wants to continue working for the company.  
Be Consistent in Maki ng Termination Decisions 
The fastest way to get hit with a discrimination or  wrongful termination claim is to treat one person 
differently than another under a similar set of circumstances. If there is a company termination policy, follow it consistently. Employers must make sure th at any action taken is consistent with the manner 
in which the company has treated other employees under similar circumstances. 
Educate and Assist Managers in the Termination Process  
A firm’s termination procedures should be estab lished by management, committed to writing, 
reviewed by legal counsel, distributed and explained to supervisors, and implemented in the event that an employee must be terminated. By having such guidelines in place and then adhering to them, a 
company reduces the possibility that the employee will prevail in a wrongful termination claim. 
  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
50 Involve Additional Persons 
Have more than one person review a terminati on decision. This person can be a human resources 
executive or other company manager. It is highly recommended that the organization’s director of 
human resources approve all terminations. Whoever re views the termination decision, that person can 
inquire into the immediate supervisor’s true motiv ations and check any other concerns (i.e., does the 
employee have a contract that controls this decision?).  
Independent Review of the Decision To Terminate 
In addition, consider obtaining an independent, out side review by an employment attorney when 
confronted with a termination decision that appears problematic.  
When, Where, and How To Fire 
Being terminated is a highly emotional experien ce. Studies have found that employees who recover 
the most quickly are those who focus on pursuing new opportunities, as opposed to those who dwell on their past circumstances. As a result of these studies, the consen sus is that employees should be 
terminated on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday so that they do not have the entire weekend to dwell on their misfortune. It is also suggested that the te rmination decision be done in the morning, when 
everyone is less tired and has the energy necessary to  deal with such a decisi on. Lastly, seek “neutral 
grounds” for communicating the termination decision, one not regularly used by any of the parties 
involved in the termination. A conference room that is private, or even an off-site location, is 
therefore, preferable to the manager's or the employee’s office. 
Have the Appropriate Paperwork Ready 
In most states, an employer is required to give an employee his or her final paycheck at the time of termination. This includes all accrued vacation pa y, sick pay, commissions, and other benefits. 
Depending on the size of the company and the state in which it is located, an employer is also 
required to give a COBRA notice for continued medical coverage, an unemployment insurance 
benefits notice, information on transferring their health insurance, and 401(k) plan details. 
Severance Pay Issues 
If the employer is considering offering any form of severance package, a release of all claims against 
the company should also be presented at the time of the termination meeting. Explain to the employee that he or she is not required to sign the agreem ent at that moment, but that he or she has the 
opportunity to speak with an attorney of his or her choosing. However, request a response to the 
release no later than 14 calendar days from the date of the document. 
Handling the Exit Interview 
A witness should be present when an employee is notified of termination. This requirement will assist in corroborating what was said during the exit interview so that someone will be able to refute a claim 
of defamation if one is made. 
What To Say, How To Say It 
The reason(s) for termination should be stated sensitively but candidly. Acknowledge the emotional 
and financial loss an employee will suffer as a result of being terminated. Finally, managers should 
choose their words carefully, as if th e exit interview were being taped, since claims are more likely to 
result when employees are treated in an unduly harsh manner.  Chapter 6–Employment Pract ices Liability Loss Control 
51 Use Counseling, Employee Assistan ce, and Outplacement Programs  
The separation of almost any relationship is accompanied by emotional upheaval. Recognize that the 
employee, even if he or she is “at fault” for the termination, will be facing uncertainty, fear, anger, 
resentment, and a host of other emotions. Anything that the employer can do to ease the transition 
will not only reduce the employer’s liability exposure  but also send a message of true caring to the 
remaining workforce.  
Other techniques to avoid wrongful termination suits (o r at least mitigate their effect if they do arise) 
include counseling, employee assistance program s (for employees with performance, personal, or 
substance abuse problems), and outplacement services.  
Assist in Finding New Employment 
Unless an employee was dishonest or deceitful, it is often a good idea to make an effort to help them 
find new employment. A willingness to expend funds for outplacement services shows a company’s 
concern for and sincere efforts to help a terminated employee. These kinds of programs sometimes reduce an employee’s incentive for making a claim a nd will assist in defending a claim if one is 
made. 
Preventing Claims from Providing References  
Providing references about former employees have  the potential to produce two types of claims.  
The Defamation Exposure 
First, they can result in claims by ex-employees alleging that their former employer provided untrue, 
defamatory references that prevented the ex-employee from obtaining a new position. 
The “Wrongful Hiring” Exposure 
Second, references sometimes result in lawsuits against firms that provide favorable references 
concerning former employees when, in fact, such ex-employees were known to have been 
incompetent, dishonest, or dangerous. This is known as “wrongful hiring,” whereby former 
employers knowingly give favorable references concerning former problematic employees. For 
example, Employer “A” gives a positive reference to Employer “B” about a former employee who 
was fired for embezzling. Company “B” hires the ex-employee, who embezzles from Company “B.” 
As a result, Company “B” sues Company “A” fo r providing a knowingly false reference.  
Obtain Releases as a Condition of Providing References 
Given these potential problems associated with references, companies should obtain signed agreements from ex-employees that will prev ent the kinds of claims discussed above.  
Specifically, companies should secure a signed “Post-Employment Release of Employment 
Information” statement that absolves a former em ployer from liability when they give reference 
information to prospective employers. Such a form will provide legal protection when a former 
employer releases subjective information about a fo rmer employee that goes beyond “name, rank, and 
serial number.”  
This alleviates the former employer’s poten tial of being sued for providing unduly negative 
references (i.e., the defamation exposure) and lowers the chance that it could be alleged by another 
employer that the former employer failed to provide candid but derogatory information about a potential employee (i.e., the wrongful hiring exposure).  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
52 Preventing Sexual Harassment Claims 
A number of actions can help an organization re duce the frequency and severity of claims alleging 
sexual harassment. These steps are noted in Exhibit 6.2 and discussed in the paragraphs that follow. 
 
Exhibit 6.2 
Preventing Sexual Harassment Claims 
• Develop a written policy against sexual harassment  
• Communicate the policy  
• Train supervisors, managers, and employees on how to implement the policy  
• Develop a complaint procedure that prot ects the employee making the complaint  
• Promptly, thoroughly, and confidentially investigate complaints  
• Carefully document investigations  
• Take timely, effective actions following investigations  
• Continuously review the program  
Develop a Written Sexual Harassment Policy  
The most important measure in preventing sexual harass ment claims is for an organization to prepare, 
distribute, publicize, and enforce a written co rporate policy against sexual harassment.  
Contents of a Sexual Harassment Policy 
An effective policy should include the following. 
• A definition of sexual harassment, along with specific examples of sexual harassment  
• Strong wording prohibiting sexual harassment  
• A confidential complaint-reporting mechanism  
• Notification that harassers will be subject to  disciplinary action, including discharge  
• Designation of an employee representative to whom complaints should be made  
• A statement that all complaints and inve stigations will be held confidential  
Communicate the Policy 
The policy must be communicated to all employees and supervisors. It should be placed on bulletin 
boards, in the HR office, and in employee manuals  or handbooks. Most importantly, the policy should 
be communicated directly, in mee tings with employees. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have 
held that the existence and communication of a corporate sexual harassment policy can sometimes 
provide an affirmative defense when  confronted with such claims. 
Train Supervisors in Implementing the Policy 
Training of all supervisors can substantially reduce an employer’s legal liability for sexual 
harassment. Persons who know the laws prohibiti ng sexual harassment should administer training. 
During training, managers and s upervisors should be given guidance regarding the types of conduct 
that constitute sexual harassment.  Chapter 6–Employment Pract ices Liability Loss Control 
53 Develop a Confidential Complaint Procedure  
Developing a confidential complaint procedure is  another key element of a corporate sexual 
harassment policy. However, unless a complaint can  be made outside of the normal organizational 
chain of command, the complaining employee is expo sed to the risk of retaliation. For example, 
assume that a female secretary alleges harassment by her male supervisor. If, under her employer’s 
complaint procedure, she must report such har assment to her supervisor, there will be obvious 
disincentive to make such a complaint, given the high probability of retaliation against her. Accordingly, sexual harassment complaint pro cedures should provide that employees must file 
grievances with appropriate individuals who work in different departments (e.g., human resources) 
within the company. This will help to maintain confidentiality and reduce the risk of retaliation. 
Investigate Complaints  
Once complaints are made, they must be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Absent such action, the policy will have little effect and will be perceive d as paying mere lip service to the problem rather 
than being a sincere attempt to eliminate sexual ha rassment within the organization. At least two 
employees should investigate complaints. Such pe rsons should be well-regarded members of the 
company and, preferably, one should be of the same gender as the complaining employee. 
Consider Using Outside Investigators 
Given the emotionally charged nature  of sexual harassment allegations , it is sometimes appropriate to 
retain the services of an outside firm to investigate sexual harassment complaints. Using such a service can often assist in maintaining independen ce and objectivity during th e investigation process, 
which might otherwise be impossible if a company employee is charged with this responsibility. For 
example, Manager A is alleged to have committe d sexual harassment. Under these circumstances, an 
independent investigator would pr obably be more objective in investigating the complaint, compared 
to Manager B, a colleague of Manager A. 
Document Investigations with Care 
It is important to recognize that internal documents pertaining to sexual harassment investigations are discoverable in legal actions. For this reason, those responsible for investigating allegations must use 
caution when or if they make subjective or derogato ry remarks, either verbally or in writing. Of 
course, such cautions apply whether they are evalua ting either the person making the complaint or the 
alleged harasser. 
Take Prompt, Appropriate Actions Following Investigations  
Following the investigation, all parties involved should be counseled. Appropriate discipline, including termination, if warranted, should follow. It is important to note that executives and managers who are harassers must not be treated  any differently than nonmanagerial/nonexecutive 
personnel. Otherwise, the policy will lose its effectiveness. 
Continuously Review the Policy  
By continuing to review the policy, modifications can be made that reflect the changing conditions of 
the company. Confidential exit inte rviews can ensure compliance with the policy, allow the company 
to assess its usefulness, and, ultimately, make im provements to assure its continued effectiveness.

57 Chapter 7 
Employment Practices Liability Coverage Options 
Chapter 7 discusses the various sources of employ ment practices liability coverage. These sources 
include: 
• Stand-alone EPLI policies  
• Coverage under D&O policies  
• EPLI coverage endorsements to D&O policies  
• Management liability policies  
• Businessowners policies (BOP) 
Before examining these sources in more detail, this  chapter begins by explaining why EPL coverage 
is not provided under commercial ge neral liability (CGL) policy forms.  
The Lack of EPL Coverage under CGL Policy Forms 
During the past 20 years, CGL policy forms became increasingly restrictive as respects the extent of 
EPL coverage they provide. As the frequency and sev erity of EPL claims began to rise in the late 
1980s, CGL insurers became reluctant to cover such claims under their policies. In addition, the 
introduction of stand-alone EPL forms beginning in th e early 1990s, and the proliferation of such 
forms by the late 1990s, have made it apparent that  CGL insurers do not intend to cover employment-
related claims.  
CG 21 47 (7/98): The Employmen t-Related Practices Exclusion 
By 1998, CGL insurers had developed a standardized exclusionary endorsement that significantly restricts the scope of EPL coverage available under th eir policies. Accordingly, nearly all CGL policy 
forms are currently being written with endorsem ent CG 21 47 (7/98), known as the Employment-
Related Practices Exclusion, that bars coverage of employment-related claims.  
More specifically, the endorsement precludes coverage  for bodily injury and personal injury resulting 
from “refusal to employ,” “termination of employment,” “coercion, demotion, evaluation, 
reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination or other employment-
related practices, policies, acts or omissions.”  
As a result, stand-alone EPLI policies that fill this significant coverage gap have become increasingly 
available; as has EPL coverage under a number of other arrangements such as EPL coverage Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
58 endorsements to D&O policies, management liab ility package policies, and businessowners policies 
(BOP).  
Stand-Alone EPLI Policies 
Buying a stand-alone EPLI policy has become a popular option as more than 50 insurers as well as 
Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) offer such  forms. The following discussion addresses the pros 
and cons of this option. 
Pros  
The three advantages of this approach include (1 ) added coverage breadth, (2) protection of D&O 
policy limits, and (3) availability of risk management and claim prevention advice. 
Added Coverage Breadth 
First, breadth of coverage is a decisive advant age. EPL exposures are “specialty” risks, much like 
D&O, intellectual property infringement, media lia bility, and other exposures that typically are 
addressed with specialty insurance products. Sta nd-alone EPLI policy underw riters better understand 
these risks and continuously update their policies to address evolving claim causes in favorable ways, as they vie for a greater or more profitable share of the EPL insurance market. By using a well-crafted, stand-alone EPLI policy, the insured obtai ns cutting-edge coverage breadth on a continuous 
basis.  
Protection of D&O Policy Limits 
Second, insulating an insured’s D&O program of coverage from EPL claims is another advantage. By 
using a stand-alone EPLI program, rather than e ndorsing a D&O policy (an alternative discussed later 
in this chapter), EPL claims are contained, without impairing the limits of the D&O form (i.e., limits 
are available to protect the directors and officers that could potentially be used to pay employment-
related claims). 
Risk Management and Claim  Prevention Advice 
Third, the availability of risk management advice and practical loss prevention tools is also a significant advantage offered by a stand-alone EPL policy. Many stand-alone EPLI insurers offer no-
cost or low-cost, yet effective advice for managi ng EPL risk, such as providing a hotline for labor and 
employment lawyers, assisting in writing employ ee manuals, and giving advi ce on potentially volatile 
situations—such as terminating a problem employee in  a way that minimizes the firm's exposure to 
liability for a wrongful termination claim.  
Cons  
Although stand-alone EPLI policies are a viable cove rage option, there are nevertheless some cons, 
even with respect to this approach, including higher premium cost and added risk management program complexity.  
Higher Premium Cost 
First, the cost of a stand-alone policy is significant.  An insured typically will spend substantially more 
in premium for a stand-alone policy than for an EPL endorsement to a D&O liability policy.  Chapter 7–Employment Practices  Liability Coverage Options 
59 Added Risk Management Program Complexity 
Second, such policies are yet another stand-alone product that adds complexity to the process of 
administering an insurance program. More specifica lly, with the exclusion of EPL exposures by CGL 
insurers, and thus the need to buy separate EPL c overage, insureds must now maintain yet another 
“tower” of insurance (i.e., a primary EPL policy and perhaps an excess EPL policy), for a risk that 
was once covered by CGL forms.  
Employment Practices Liability Coverage under D&O Policies 
One key point to recognize is that most D&O po licies do not specifically exclude coverage for 
employment-related claims. On the other hand, ne ither do they provide explicit coverage for such 
claims. In addition, there are a number of other limitations associated with the scope of EPL coverage D&O forms provide. These limitations are discussed below. 
Limitations of EPL Coverage under D&O Forms 
The actual scope of EPL coverage that D&O forms afford is limited by the following provisions.  
Only Directors and Officers are Insureds under the Policy 
Only directors and officers are insureds unde r a D&O policy written to cover publicly-traded 
corporations. Yet, because non-director/officer employees are routinely named as defendants in 
employment claims, this omission creates a significant coverage gap. 
No Coverage for the Corporate Entity 
Most D&O policies written to cover publicly-trade d corporations contain what is known as “entity 
coverage.” In addition to covering individual dir ectors and officers, D&O forms that include entity 
coverage also protect the corporate entity, when the entity is named as a defendant in a lawsuit. However, such protection only applies to claims  involving the company’s securities. The coverage 
does not apply to any other type of claims, including employment claims.  
Insured versus Insured Exclusions 
These exclusions, which preclude cove rage for lawsuits by one director/officer against another, will 
defeat coverage in a number of situations. For ex ample, because it is common for an officer, after he 
or she is terminated; or a director, after being ask ed to step down from a corporate board, to sue the 
directors and officers of the company, insured vers us insured exclusions fre quently preclude coverage 
for such claims. (Note that “former insureds” are also considered “insureds” under D&O policies, so 
that the insured versus insured exclusion is still operative, even after termination.) 
Employment Practices Liability Exclusions 
The true intent of D&O policies written to cover publicly-traded corporations is to cover claims 
caused by the business decisions of the firm’s direct ors and officers. Accordingly, a handful of such 
forms contain blanket exclusions of all claims associated with the employment process. 
Employment Practices Liability Endorsements to D&O Policies 
Given the serious coverage limitations associated with relying on a D&O policy for coverage of EPL 
claims as noted above, beginning in the mid-1990s, D&O insurers began offering specialized D&O 
coverage endorsements, in conjunction with the standard D&O policy form.  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
60 The EPLI Coverage Endorsements 
Typically, the endorsement costs an additional 10 percent of the D&O premium, although in certain 
instances, insurers will provide such coverage for no additional premium.  
Even if the full 10 percent premium is charged,  obtaining EPL coverage in this manner is cost-
effective, compared to buying a stand-alone policy.  
Pitfalls of D&O Coverage Endorsements 
Despite this cost advantage, there a number of substantial drawbacks to these endorsements, the nature of which are noted below. 
Limits Dilution  
EPLI endorsements do not create a separate limit of insurance. Rather, the coverage is subject to the existing aggregate limits available to cover claims  against directors and officers. Accordingly, these 
limits can be diluted by EPL claims, something that directors and officers do not favor. 
Higher Deductibles  
EPLI endorsements are subject to the same deductibl es as are applicable to D&O claims, which are 
typically much higher than those applicable under a stand-alone EPLI form. Thus, all but the most serious EPL claims will fall below this figure, thereby precluding insurer reimbursement.  
Frequent Lack of Coverage for the Corporate Entity  
Although entity coverage for securities claims is  available under D&O policies, allegations naming 
the corporate entity when it is a plaintiff in an  EPL suit are covered by most, but not all, EPLI 
endorsements to D&O policy forms. In contrast, virtually all stand-alone EPLI forms routinely cover the corporate entity as a named insured.  
Frequent Lack of Coverage for N on-Directors and Non-Officers  
EPLI endorsements to D&O policies can create yet a nother critical coverage gap since again, most, 
but not all EPLI endorsements to D&O policies, cover non-directors/non-officers. 
Fewer Covered Perils Compared to Stand-Alone Forms 
Virtually all EPLI endorsements to D&O policy forms cover the four key employment-related perils: 
wrongful termination, sexual harassment, discr imination, and retaliation. However, EPLI 
endorsements to D&O policies generally cover only a limited number of what are referred to as the 
various types of “inappropriate employment conduct.” Such conduct includes, but is not limited to 
breach of an oral or written employment contract, employment-related misrepresentation, wrongful 
failure to promote, wrongful discipline, wrongful de privation of a career opportunity, failure to grant 
tenure, constructive discharge, negligent evalua tion, invasion of privacy, employment-related 
defamation, and employment-related emotional di stress. Usually, an EPL endorsement to a D&O 
policy will only cover four to six of these items, compared to an average of about a dozen under stand-alone EPLI forms. 
Management Liability Policies 
Management liability policies afford anothe r alternative for obtaining EPL coverage. Chapter 7–Employment Practices  Liability Coverage Options 
61 Basic Structure 
As the name indicates, such policies “bundle” EPL coverage along with several other lines of 
insurance, including D&O, fiduciary liability, and special crime coverage (also known as 
kidnap/ransom insurance). Therefore, management  liability policies can be considered “package 
policies,” because they combine more than one line of coverage under a single policy. 
A Flexible Structure 
Usually, an insured must only select two of these four types of coverage, to be eligible to purchase EPL coverage under a management liability policy form. In other words, an insured seeking EPL coverage need only buy one other of the following coverages to obtain a management liability policy: 
D&O, fiduciary, or special crime coverage. 
Common Policy Conditions  
Management liability policies always contain a set of common policy conditions that apply to all of 
the four lines of insurance afforded. Such provisions are, of course, general in nature and pertain to 
matters such as cancellation, subrogation, and cooper ation with the insurer in the event of a claim. 
Coverage-Specific Policy Forms 
In addition to the common policy conditions, mana gement liability policies contain a coverage-
specific policy for each of the different types of  coverage selected by the insured. These forms 
address areas particular to the line of coverage purchased, such as an enumeration of the types of 
covered acts of inappropriate employment conduct.  
Cost Advantage 
Management liability policies afford meaningful premium discounts, compared to what would be 
charged, if an insured were to purchase the aforem entioned types of coverage separately. This is 
because there are cost efficiencies inherent in  the underwriting and policy issuance process when 
more than one coverage line is provided under a si ngle policy. Specifically, an insurer needs much of 
the same data to underwrite EPL coverage as fo r D&O, fiduciary, and special crime insurance. 
Limited Eligibility 
Typically, management liability forms are only made available to privately-held firms, not-for-profit 
organizations, and relatively sma ll publicly-traded companies (i.e., those with annual sales of under 
$25 million). 
Nature and Scope of EPLI Coverage 
Management liability policies overcome virtually all of the disadvantages created by EPLI endorsements to D&O policies. Specifically, such policies:  
• Contain separate limits and separate deductibles for each of the coverages, so that a single 
large claim does not reduce or exhaust the limits available for other types of claims.  
• Cover non-directors/non-officers as insureds. 
• Cover the corporate entity as an insured. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
62 • Provide a much broader scope of inappropriate conduct perils than what is available under 
EPL endorsements to D&O forms, which, under a nu mber of insurers’ forms, are as broad as 
that afforded by a typical stand-alone EPLI policies. 
Combined Single Limits 
Although, as indicated above, most management liabi lity policies are written with separate limits for 
each of the coverages selected, a minority of policies, and especially those for small firms, are written with a combined single limit.  
This approach is almost always less costly than one in which separate limits are provided. It is 
adequate for small insureds that have very low claim frequency. For such companies, the probability 
of sustaining both an EPL and a D&O, fiduciary, special crime claim in a single year is remote. Thus, 
for such organizations, a policy containing a separate EPL limit may not justify the additional cost. 
(Management liability policies are most often u sed by small, privately-held companies.)  
EPLI Coverage under Businessowners Policies 
Yet another source of EPLI covera ge is businessowners policy (BOP) forms. Such coverage is 
provided by attaching the Employment-Related Practices Liability Endorsement, form BP 05 89 (01 06), to a BOP. This endorsement is part of the portfolio of coverage forms offered by Insurance 
Services Office, Inc. (ISO), an organization that de velops standard policy forms and files information 
with state regulators on behalf of insurance companies that purchase its services. 
What Are BOPs? 
BOPs are “package policies” for small businesses. A “package policy” is one that combines several 
different coverages under a single form, most of ten, general liability insurance and property 
insurance. A key feature of package policies—and on e that significantly impacts the pricing structure 
of the employment-related practices liability endorsem ent—is that package policies usually afford 
meaningful premium discounts. This is because, as is also the case with mana gement liability policies 
noted earlier, there are cost efficiencies inhere nt in the underwriting process when more than one 
coverage line is provided under a single policy. 
Eligibility 
As already noted, the ISO BOP is designed for insuring small businesses. Eligibility is based on the 
nature as well as the size of the insured’s business. 
There are two basic requirements that a business must meet to be eligible:  
• none of its locations can exceed 25,000 in squa re footage (excluding basements not open to 
the public), and  
• it must not exceed $3 million in annual gross sales.  
   
 
 Chapter 7–Employment Practices  Liability Coverage Options 
63 Ineligible Businesses 
The following types of businesses ar e ineligible, regardless of whether they meet the requirements 
noted above. 
• Manufacturers  
• Auto repair or service stations; auto, motor home, mobile home, and motorcycle dealers; 
parking lots or garages  
• Bars and pubs  
• Places of amusement  
• Banks and other financial institutions  
• Self-storage facilities that provide outdoor st orage of motorized vehicles of any type  
How Employment Practices Liability is Covered under BOPs 
BOPs do not automatically cover employment prac tices liability exposures. Rather, the policies cover 
EPLI exposures by means of an employment-relate d practices liability endorsement, form BP 05 89 
(01 06). This endorsement is a seven-page cove rage form, written on a claims-made basis.  
No EPL Coverage Endorsement Availa ble under ISO, Non-BOP Policies 
Interestingly, there is no similar EPLI coverage  endorsement found within the ISO commercial 
general liability (CGL) or property insurance endorsement  portfolios. In other words, if an insured is 
covered by a “standard” ISO propert y or ISO CGL policy (i.e., the bus iness is not eligible for a BOP), 
ISO offers no comparable endorsement that can be attached to either the CGL policy or property 
policy to also afford EPLI coverage. Therefore, if  a company is ineligible for a BOP form, it must 
obtain EPLI coverage by one of the four approaches noted at the beginning of this chapter. ISO does offer a stand-alone EPLI policy of its own, although an analysis of the form is beyond the scope of 
this course.  
Premium Determination 
The premium is determined by applying a state-specific rate, for the $10,000 basic limit of coverage 
provided by the endorsement. The specific rate is a function of: (1) the type of business being covered 
and (2) the number of covered employees. The basic rating unit is a cost per employee.  
As noted, the basic limit available under the ISO EPLI  coverage endorsement is $10,000. However, a 
limit of up to $100,000 is available. The basic deductible available under the ISO EPLI  coverage endorsement is $500. However, a 
deductible of up to $25,000 is available, for wh ich commensurate premium credit is granted.  
Coverage Aspects 
For the most part, the coverage afforded by the endorsement uses the same provisions found within 
stand-alone EPLI forms.   
 
 Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
64 Positive Features 
And in some respects, the endorsement actually offers an even broader scope of coverage than do 
standard EPLI forms (e.g., a more liberal counsel  selection provision, an extended reporting period 
limit reinstatement, no punitive damages restrictions ; coverage areas that will be discussed later in 
this course).  
Negative Features 
Conversely, there are a few areas in which th e coverage falls below customary stand-alone 
approaches, including the following: (1) constructiv e discharge and breach of confidentiality/privacy 
are not covered perils; (2) a lack of coverage for certain special categories of employees such as leased, temporary, part-time employees, and for ot her persons, such as independent contractors, 
applicants, and volunteers; (3) no coverage for third- party liability; and (4) the absence of a discovery 
provision (such provisions will be discussed in Chapter 12 of this course).  
The Need for Higher Limits 
In addition to the coverage deficiencies noted, the largest possible limit that can be purchased under 
ISO’s BOP program is $100,000. This is not really sufficient to address the kinds of employment practices liability exposures faced by even the sma ll employers for which the program is designed. 
(At times, however, insurers do file state exceptions to these maximum limits, and they are typically 
approved by regulators.)

67 Chapter 8 
Covered Organizations, Covered Persons, and Covered Acts Provisions in Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
Chapter 8 will discuss the: (1) covered organiza tions, (2) covered persons , and (3) covered acts 
provisions contained in stand-alone employment practices liability insurance policy forms.  
Covered Organizations  
Unlike D&O liability policies, EPL policies provide explicit coverage for the corporate entity. This is 
critical because virtually all EPL lawsuits name both the corporate entity and specific individuals as 
defendants. Accordingly, if a lawsuit were filed naming an employee such as a manager or supervisor, as well as “XYZ Corporation” as a de fendant, the policy would also cover XYZ 
Corporation. 
Covered Persons 
Under nearly all of the policies, officers, directors, partners, managers, and employees are typically “covered persons.” In addition, the forms cover (1) personal representativ es of insureds such as heirs, 
administrators, and executors and (2) spouses, but on ly for their “status” as spouses, if they are also 
named in a lawsuit, but not for any actual wrongful acts. If a claim were made against an employee, 
coverage would also extend to the employee’s spou se, but only as to the spouse’s interest in assets 
held jointly (to which claimants’ attorneys frequent ly seek access). In contrast, the employee’s spouse 
would not have coverage if, for example, the s pouse was accused of committing sexual harassment at 
the insured company’s Christmas party. 
Definition of “Employee” 
While all of the policies cover “employees,” there is  some variation between the exact definitions of 
the term “employee.” The following categor ies of “employee” are usually covered. 
• Full-time employees  
• Part-time employees  
• Leased employees  
• Temporary employees  
• Seasonal employees  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
68 • Interns  
• Volunteers  
Coverage of Leased Employees 
For coverage to apply to leased workers, all thr ee of the following requirements need to be met: (1) 
the insured must agree to provide legal indemnifica tion to the leased worker, as if the worker were an 
actual employee of the insured corporation. (Absen t an agreement to indemnify leased workers, the 
insured company would not be legally obligated to indemnify the leased worker for his or her 
conduct. This is because legally, such workers are the employees of the leasing firm.) (2) The firm 
that leases the worker to the insured must be schedul ed as an insured under the policy. (3) The insured 
must pay an additional premium to cover the leased workers. Typically, the per-leased worker 
premium is 1/3rd of the usual per employee premium.  
Coverage of Independent Contractors 
Independent contractors are not included within  the definition of “employee” under EPLI policy 
forms and are therefore not covered. However, about  half of all insurers’ forms can be endorsed to 
provide such coverage by individually listing th e independent contractors it wishes to cover and by 
paying additional premium. In contrast, other insu rers’ forms specifically preclude such coverage 
under any circumstances. 
Covered Acts 
Most EPLI forms cover five specific categories of employment-related perils: (1) discrimination, (2) 
wrongful termination, (3) harassment, (4) reta liation, and (5) a number of other specifically-
enumerated acts, referred to collectively as “ina ppropriate employment conduct.” In effect, most are 
considered named perils policies. 
Discrimination 
There is often variation between the manner in  which the different policies define the term 
“discrimination.” Typically, the forms indicate that coverage applies to various types of 
discrimination, and they specifically enumerate su ch discrimination on the basis of: “race,” “color,” 
“religion,” “age,” “gender,” “sexual orientation,” “n ational origin,” or “disability.” However, such 
lists are not all-inclusive (nor can they ever really be, given the ever-increasing categories of 
protected classes of persons), because they someti mes omit various bases for discrimination, such as 
HIV status, pregnancy, Vietnam-era veteran status, disability, appearance, and so on.  
Catchall Discrimination Coverage Provisions 
Since it is difficult to list every possible basis on which employment-related discrimination can be 
alleged (because the number of categories is expandi ng constantly), most, but not all, policies also 
contain what are known as “catchall provisions” or “omnibus clauses.” These provisions apply to claims alleging various types of discrimination and, in addition, incl ude within their definitions of 
discrimination the statement that coverage also a pplies to “... any other status that is protected 
pursuant to any applicable federal, state, or local  statute or ordinance.” This wording is a positive 
feature for insureds because federal, state, and local laws vary with respect to their individual definitions of “protected persons.” It is also va luable because discrimination laws are a constantly 
changing and especially dynamic aspect of the law. Accordingly, such provisions assure that the broadest possible range of bases upon which discrimination can be alleged, will be covered.  Chapter 8–Covered Organizations, C overed Persons, an d Covered Acts 
Provisions in Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
69 Wrongful Termination 
Most, but not all, of the policies define the term “w rongful termination.” However, it is actually to the 
insured’s advantage when “wrongful termination” is  not defined by an EPLI policy. This is because a 
definition of the term only serves to restrict—rather than expand—the scope of  coverage available.  
Those forms that do define “wrongful termination” normally define it as “... actual or constructive 
termination of the employment relationship in a mann er that is wrongful and against the law or which 
breaches an implied agreement to continue employment.”  
No Coverage for Breach of an Ex press Employment Contract  
One key point to note is that nearly all of the policies, either in their definitions of “wrongful 
termination” or in the exclusions section of the policies, preclude coverage for both indemnity and 
defense coverage resulting from wrongful termina tion alleging breach of an express employment 
contract (i.e., an employment contract for a stat ed number of years, containing clearly delineated 
compensation amounts, but barring termination, ex cept for gross misconduct). As will be explained 
later, in the exclusions portion of this course, the rationale for excluding coverage for employment 
contracts is that they are within the insured organization’s control and are considered by insurers to be 
a business risk, for which coverage is not intended. In recent years, however, a handful of insurers 
have begun to offer coverage, vi a endorsement and for additional premium, for defense coverage 
required by such claims. 
Coverage for Breach of “Implied” Employment Contract Breaches 
Most policies do, however, offer both defense and indemnity coverage in situations where an 
employee plaintiff alleges that a termination breached an “implied” contract of employment. More specifically, plaintiffs often assert that wording in: (1) an offer letter or in (2) an employee handbook 
created an “implied” contract of employment. 
Harassment 
Up until around 2002, virtually all EPL policy fo rms covered “sexual harassment” rather than 
“harassment,” as is now the case under a majority of  insurers’ policy wording. This change occurred 
because it became apparent that harassment is usually, but not always, of a sexual nature.  
Coverage for Harassment of a Nonsexual Nature 
Accordingly, coverage for non-sexual harassment also became necessary because it has become 
common in the workplace. For example, one employee may purposely and cont inually annoy another 
employee by means of name-calling and taunting, although not in a sexual manner. Or, one employee 
may constantly make demands th at another employee loan him money. Under a policy that only 
covered liability for “sexual harassment,” claims aris ing from these situations would not be covered.  
The importance of having coverage for harassment of a nonsexual nature is evidenced by a study 
conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. Specifically, 
managers at one in four of the workplaces surveyed  reported bullying and three out of five said that 
uncivil behavior (e.g., berating and the “silent tr eatment”) had occurred within the past year. 
 
  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
70 Accordingly, an EPLI policy form should address such situations by covering “harassment” and 
defining that term so it covers both sexual harassment and nonsexual harassment. The policies usually 
define harassment as comprising one (or more) of  four key elements. Specifically, harassment 
involving unwelcome sexual or nonsexual advances, verbal or physical conduct, or requests for sexual or nonsexual favors that: 
• Are either explicitly or implicitly made a condition of employment;  
• Are used to make decisions that affect a person's employment;  
• Create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or  
• Interfere with job performance.  
Retaliation 
Retaliation claims, which are covered by virtually ev ery insurer’s form, are most frequently made in 
conjunction with Title VII claims, in which discrimin ation is alleged on the basis of gender, race, or 
national origin. In addition, retaliation is frequently alleged under a variety of other circumstances, 
including in conjunction with a claim of sexual harassment or wrongful termination, or in response to an employee’s making a claim under a state workers compensation law or whistleblower statute. 
“Inappropriate Employment Conduct” 
As already noted, nearly every insurer’s polic y form provides coverage for claims alleging 
discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and retaliation. In addition to these categories of 
claims, most EPLI policies also contain a secti on titled “inappropriate employment conduct” that 
enumerates a variety of other employment-related pe rils not falling within any of the preceding four 
categories. Importantly, this is the area in which the actual scope of coverage provided by the policies 
varies most significantly. This is because the exact list of items that are classified as “inappropriate 
employment conduct” differs from insurer to insure r and must therefore be examined on a policy-to-
policy basis. Clearly, the broader the scope of perils falling within a policy’s definition of 
“inappropriate employment conduct,” the more favorable the policy is for the insured.  
Exhibit 8.1 indicates a number of the more common acts considered to be “inappropriate workplace 
conduct.”

An “All Risks” EPLI Policy: The Ultimate Scope of Coverage  
As noted earlier in this section, the vast majority of EPLI policies are written on a named perils basis 
(e.g., coverage for harassment, di scrimination, wrongful termination,  retaliation, and inappropriate 
employment conduct). However, a handful of insu rers, responding to competition, offer “all risks” 
policies which afford superior protection, compared  to named perils polici es. Like named perils 
policies, these forms explicitly cover the four ke y covered perils (harassment, discrimination, 
wrongful termination, and retaliation). In addition, such policies also note that the policy covers “all 
other workplace torts.” Since there is virtually no limit to the kinds and types of employment-related 
allegations that can be made (in part, due to the cr eativity of plaintiff’s atto rneys), an all risks policy 
is valuable. Consider a claim where an employee alleges that her employer had promised her a 
company car if she met a certain sales target. The employee met the target, but the employer failed to 
deliver the car as promised. There is no standard EPL policy peril to cover such a claim. However, under an EPL form written on an all risks basis, an insurer would be hard-pressed to deny coverage in Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
72 this situation. The effect of this wording is to convert a named peril EPLI policy into an all risks EPLI 
policy, which is clearly favorable for an insured.  
One Final Caveat: Check the Scope of Policy Exclusions 
Certainly, there are significant advantages associat ed with EPLI policy forms written on an all risks 
basis. Nevertheless, there is one important pitfall associated with such form s. Specifically, the scope 
of the “Exclusions” sections of such policies tends to be more extensive than those ordinarily found in 
EPLI policies written on a named perils basis.

73 Chapter 9 
Third-Party Liability, Covered Damages, and Definition of “Claim” Provisions in Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
Chapter 9 will discuss the third-party liability covera ge, covered damages, and definition of “claim” 
provisions within EPL policies. 
Third-Party Liability Coverage 
The original purpose of EPLI policies was to provi de coverage for claims made by employees. More 
specifically, such policies were designed to cover claims in which employees alleged that employers 
or fellow employees committed wrongful acts in conjunction with their employment. However, in 
recent years, there have been a number of incide nts in which non-employees (most often customers, 
clients, and vendors) have also made claims alleging harassment and discrimination, committed by 
employers and their employees. These claims have been termed “third-party liability claims.” 
Third-Party Liability Claims: Two Examples 
Two high-profile examples of third-party liability allegations have been those made by customers 
belonging to minority groups, in which they claimed to have been discriminated against by Denny’s, the national restaurant chain, and Adam’s Mark, the national hotel chain. In addition to these two claims, both of which produced multimillion dollar settlements, numerous other third-party claims are being reported with increasing frequenc y. Accordingly, given the expandi ng nature of this exposure, 
EPL insurers have responded by offering what is known as “third-party liability” coverage.  
The Need for Third-Party Liability Coverage 
Coverage for third-party liability employment claims is needed because commercial general liability 
(CGL) policies provide little, if any coverage for most workplace-related claims. First, as already 
noted in this course, CGL forms exclude coverage  for work-related harassment and discrimination—
the two causes of action most likely to be alleged in  claims by third parties. In addition, coverage 
under CGL forms requires that damages produce: bodily injury, property damage, contractual liability, or advertising injury. Since the latter th ree items virtually never involve employment-related 
claims and because few such claims involve bodi ly injury, separate coverage is required. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
74 Public Contact: The Key Driver of Third-Party Liability Claims 
A firm’s exposure to third-party liability claims is dr iven largely by the extent to which its operations 
involve contact with the public. For example, an airline, which engages in considerable customer 
contact, would have a much greater exposure to third-party claims, compared to a firm that 
manufactures aircraft engines for sale to a handful of large industrial customers. Similarly, a car rental 
agency has greater third-party EPL exposure than would an accounting firm.  
How Third-Party Liability Coverage Is Provided within EPL Forms 
Third-party liability coverage is afforded under EPL policies in one of two ways: (1) by endorsement 
or (2) such coverage is built into the policy. 
Most often, third-party EPL coverage will be  added by endorsement, whereby a pre-printed 
endorsement containing the applicable coverage wo rding, is attached to the policy and for which 
additional premium is required.  Less often, both “regular” EPL coverage and third-pa rty EPL coverage wording is included within an 
EPL form’s insuring agreements. If the insured or ganization seeks third-party coverage, it simply 
pays the additional premium required. Under such circumstances, the declarations page will note that 
the insured has purchased third-part y coverage and a premium amount  will be included on that page. 
Scope of Third-Party Liability Coverage 
It is important to check the actual scope of third- party coverage provided. This is because the breadth 
of coverage is not necessarily the same as that affo rded within the regular EPLI policy, depending on 
the individual insurer. For example, a few third- party endorsements (or built-in coverage wording) 
exclude coverage for class action (i.e., multiple plai ntiff) lawsuits. From the insured’s standpoint, 
coverage on this (or any basis less comprehensive than that afforded under the regular EPLI form) 
should be rejected. This is because class action lawsu its by customers have, in recent years, proven to 
be the most costly type of third-party claim. Rather, third-party coverage endorsements should be 
subject to the same scope of coverage offered by the rest of the policy, and the insured should 
negotiate for coverage on this basis. 
Covered Damages Definition 
EPLI policy forms cover judgments, settlements, and de fense costs. There are, however, a number of 
other items that do not fall within, and are therefore precluded by, the policies’ definitions of “loss” or 
“damages.” 
Punitive Damages 
Punitive damages are usually found within an EPLI policy’s definiti on of “damages.” This is because 
in recent years nearly all insurers’ forms starte d granting coverage for punitive damages, provided 
punitive damages are insurable in the jurisdiction within which a claim for such damages has been brought. Since employment practices liability claim judgments frequently include punitive damages, the value of such coverage is considerable.  
Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions 
Since the early 2000s, EPL insurers have attempted to circumvent state-specific prohibitions against 
insurer payment of punitive damages (i.e., about 40 percent of the states bar such coverage) by means 
of what are known as “most favorable jurisdiction” provisions. Such wording states that, with respect Chapter 9–Third-Party Liability, Covere d Damages, and Definition of “Claim” 
Provisions in Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
75 to determining the insurability of punitive damages,  the law of the jurisdiction most favorable to the 
insurability of punitive damages will apply, provide d one of the following four criteria are met: (1) 
the act giving rise to the punitive damages award occurred in a jurisdiction allowing punitive damages 
coverage; (2) the claim giving rise to the punitive da mages is made in such a jurisdiction; (3) the 
insured is incorporated or maintains its principa l place of business in a jurisdiction allowing punitive 
damages coverage; or (4) the insurer is incorporat ed or maintains its principal place of business in 
such a jurisdiction.  
When Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions are Critical 
A most favorable jurisdiction provision would be im portant in the following scenario. Assume that an 
insured is incorporated in a state that bars insurance payment of punitive damages and that a punitive 
damage award is made against the insured in this  jurisdiction. However, the insured has an EPLI 
policy written with a most favorable jurisdiction provi sion and the insurer is incorporated in a state 
where punitive damages coverage is permitted. As a result, the insurer will indemnify the insured for 
payment of the punitive damages award, regardless of the fact that the insured is incorporated in and punitive damages were awarded in a jurisdiction that bars such payment. Accordingly, most favorable 
venue wording is imperative (a) when purchasing an EPL policy in a state where punitive damages 
are not insurable and (b) for insured companies having multistate operati ons and who therefore 
cannot predict where the claims seeking punitive damages will arise. 
Two Limitations of Most Favorable Jurisdiction Provisions 
Most favorable jurisdiction provisions contain two key limitations. First, they merely modify the existing level of coverage for punitive damages al ready provided by an EPL policy; they do not 
provide coverage if punitive damages are excluded by the policy (although the vast majority of EPL 
forms do not). Second, the enforceability of most favorable jurisdiction wording has never been tested in court. As a result, insureds should request su ch wording, but not be required to pay additional 
premium for it, because an insurer’s liability for paym ent, as a result of this endorsement, remains 
uncertain. 
Fines, Penalties 
Virtually all of the forms’ definitions of “loss” or  “damages” preclude coverage for fines, penalties, 
and similar items. To provide coverage of fines and penalties would contrave ne public policy. For 
example, there would be no coverage if an employ er were required to pay a fine for violating the 
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (W ARN) Act, a law that requires employers to 
provide certain minimum advance notice periods, pr ior to conducting large-scale plant closings.  
Stock Benefits 
This refers to stock made available by mean s of: (1) stock option grants, (2) employee stock 
ownership plans, and (3) employee stock purchase plans. The policies’ definition of covered 
damages/covered loss precludes “stock benefits” becau se it is not their intent to make payments in 
conjunction with executive terminations in which it is alleged that as a result of such terminations, the 
executive was wrongfully denied stock options. In addition, most stock benefit claims involve 
employment contracts, an area that EPLI insurers al so avoid covering since the insured corporation is 
in control of such contracts, thus constituting an uninsurable business risk. 
Nor do the policies intend to cover losses sustained from employee stock purchase plans involving 
401(k)-type programs. Rather, such exposures are addressed by fiduciary liability policy forms.  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
76 ADA-Associated Costs 
Virtually all EPL policies’ definitions of “loss” or  “damages” preclude payment for the costs of 
modifying buildings as required by the ADA, when it is necessary to accommodate employees who 
fall within the purview of this law. Such cost s are excluded because they constitute a business risk. 
The policies do not, however, exclude coverage to de fend allegations that an insured failed to comply 
with the ADA. For instance, if a prospective employee sues a company for discrimination because it failed to hire her and also refused to build a wh eelchair ramp, the policy would cover defense costs 
associated with such allegations. However, it w ould not cover the cost of building the ramp.  
Non-pecuniary Relief 
Coverage for relief not involving monetary dama ges (e.g., reinstating a wrongfully terminated 
employee) is not within the policies’ definitions of “loss” or “damages.” This is because insurance 
contracts provide promises to pay money under certain circumstances, rather than providing 
performance guarantees. 
Damages Associated with  Employment Contracts 
Coverage for damages involving contracts of employ ment, such as liquidated damages in the event an 
employee is terminated without cause, do not fall within EPLI policies’ definitions of “loss” or “damages.” For instance, if, under an employment c ontract, an executive claimed that he was owed 2 
years’ salary if he is terminated without cause,  the policies would not cover the corporation’s 
obligation to pay 2 years’ salary. The rationale for this approach is that the drafting of employment 
contracts is within the control of the insured or ganization, thus constitu ting an uninsurable business 
risk.  
Insurance Plan, Pension, or Savings Plan Benefits  
Some, although not all, of the forms, either by thei r definitions of “loss” or “damages,” or within the 
exclusions sections, preclude covera ge for benefits owed to employees (e.g., health insurance, 401(k) 
plans as part of judgments or settlements. The rationa le underlying this position is that obligations to 
provide employee benefits are business risks and ther efore do not fall within the scope of coverage 
intended by the policies.  
Another justification for this definition of loss is that the policy does not intend to cover items that 
could be addressed by a fiduciary or employee benefits liability policy.  
Still another reason for excluding insurance plan be nefits is that their actual cost, on a long-term, 
“going-forward” basis, is highly speculative. For example, if a claimant is awarded 10 years of 
benefits (that she would have received had she not been wrongfully terminated), it would be very 
difficult to predict the actual cost of such benefits  that many years into the future. Case-in-point: 
during some years, the cost of health insurance cove rage rises by 3 to 5 percent, whereas in others, it 
has increased by as much as 20 percent.  
Costs Relating to Labor Disputes 
Such costs are precluded either by the policies’ “loss” or “damages” definitions or by separate 
exclusions because these costs are again considered  business risks to which firms in particular 
industries, especially those subject to co llective bargaining agreements, are exposed. Chapter 9–Third-Party Liability, Covere d Damages, and Definition of “Claim” 
Provisions in Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
77 Claim Definition 
The manner in which EPL policies define the term “claim” is an important coverage issue. The 
broadest possible definition is ideal because it tends  to accelerate the trigger of coverage under an 
EPL form, which is usually advantageous from the in sured’s standpoint. Although the exact definition 
of “claim” varies from policy to policy, the follo wing are events that trigger a “claim” under the 
typical policy. 
Coverage for Written and Oral Demands 
Coverage is triggered under the policies not only by a written demand (i.e., a summons and 
complaint), but also by an oral demand. Often, clai ms will be made orally by an employee-claimant’s 
attorney (e.g., when he/she calls the insured company, notifying it of  the intention to sue). In other 
instances, oral claims are made by employees. For in stance, after being terminated at the end of an 
exit interview, many an employee has said something to the effect of “I’m going to sue this place for 
everything it’s worth.” Oral notification of a clai m accelerates the trigger of coverage, because it 
eliminates the need to wait for a written lawsuit before  reporting the claim to an insurer, this approach 
is advantageous for an insured. 
Coverage for Administrative Hearings 
Virtually all of the policies’ definitions of “clai m” encompass administrative proceedings before the 
EEOC, as well as proceedings and hearings before applicable local, state, and federal agencies. This 
is critical because frequently, and prior to hiring an  employment lawyer to bring a claim, an employee 
will contact the EEOC who, in turn, will call for a hearing in regard to the employee’s grievance. (In addition, other local, state, and federal agencies routinely bring claims on employees’ behalf.) Accordingly, it is advantageous for coverage to be triggered unde r an insured organization’s EPL 
policy under these kinds of circumstances. 
Coverage for Criminal Proceedings 
Also important is the fact that nearly all of th e policies’ definitions of “claim” encompass coverage 
for criminal proceedings associated with employment litigation. Such covera ge is advantageous for 
insureds because civil employment litigation also frequently has a criminal component. Case-in-point: 
the CEO of a corporation is sued civilly for sexual harassment. In addition, he is charged with assault in connection with the sexual harassment and will also require defense coverage for the criminal indictment. Frequently, such indictments occur prior to the receipt of a civil lawsuit so that the trigger 
of coverage in this manner is advantageous for the insured.

79 Chapter 10 
Claims Management, Defense Cost, and Special Conditions in Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
Given the nature of employment-related litigati on, the claims management and defense cost 
provisions are among the most important sections in the policy. In addition, EPL policies are written 
with a number of conditions that are particular to  such policies. Chapter 10 examines these provisions 
in detail. 
Claims Management Provisions 
The manner in which a policy addresses the claims ma nagement process has a significant bearing on 
the actual scope of coverage provided by an EPLI  policy. The key claim handling areas include: (1) 
claims settlement procedures, (2) duty to defend versus non-duty to defend la nguage, and (3) defense 
cost provisions. 
Claims Settlement Procedures 
The vast majority of EPL forms contain the tr aditional “hammer clause” provision. A hammer clause 
becomes operative when the insured and insurer ca nnot agree on a settlement figure proposed by the 
insurer. Under such circumstances, if the insured pr efers to defend a claim rather than settle it, the 
insured must pay any additional amount for which th e claim is eventually settled plus pay defense 
costs incurred from the point at which the insured takes over the defense of the claim.  
Coinsurance Hammer Clauses—A Favorable Variation 
One favorable variation of the hammer clause is the so-called coinsuran ce hammer clause. Such 
provisions provide for: (1) a sharing of defense co sts incurred after the insu red refuses to consent to 
settlement and for (2) a sharing of any settlement am ount or judgment amount that is larger than the 
settlement amount that the insurer originally wanted the insured to accept. Most common sharing 
percentages typically are 50/50 but can go higher (e.g., 70 insurer/30 insured).  
Why Coinsurance Hammer Clauses are Valuable 
Coinsurance hammer clauses are important because they  continue coverage on a partial basis if the 
insured decides to litigate rather than settle a claim based on an in surer’s recommendation. Given the 
precedent-setting implications of employment litiga tion, this option is especially valuable because 
such provisions reduce the financial risk associated with contesting a meritless claim that could, if Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
80 settled—rather than litigated to a “no liability ve rdict”—encourage similarly groundless allegations 
against the insured in the future.  
For example, assume that an employee was termin ated for poor performance, that the insured 
organization had convincing document ation of the sub-standard work , and that the organization had 
given the employee ample time to improve her perfo rmance. Despite these circumstances, the former 
employee brings a wrongful termination claim. If the company were to settle the case, it could send a 
message to other employees (and potential future claimants) that the firm will compromise even 
groundless claims, a clearly unfavorable precedent. However, under an EPL form containing a co-insurance hammer clause, if the employer did not want to settle the claim, it could continue to contest 
the case, but at much less financial risk than if  its policy contained a standard hammer clause.  
Duty To Defend Language versus Non-Duty To Defend Language 
When EPLI policies emerged in the early 1990s, most  of the forms were written on a “duty to defend” 
basis. Today, however, the EPLI market has evolved to the point where the policyholder often has the option to purchase what is known as a non-duty to defend form. 
The phrase “duty to defend” in an EPLI policy expre ssly states that the insurer has the duty to defend 
any claim alleging a covered act under the policy. The phrase indicating that the insurer has “no duty to defend” in an EPLI policy states that the insurer 
does not have the duty to defend claims; rather that it is the duty of the insured to defend claims. Such 
forms only compel the insurer to pay the defense co sts in connection with the insured’s executing the 
defense of the claims. 
Three of the important differences between a “non- duty to defend” and “duty to defend” policy are: 
(1) the right to choose defense counsel, (2) the right to control the defense of the claim, and (3) the 
insurer’s obligation to defend the entire claim when one or more allegations associated with a given 
claim are not covered by the policy.  
The Right to Select Defense Counsel 
 The first difference between these two types of po licies is that under a “duty to defend” policy, 
unless specifically negotiated otherwise in the policy, the insurer has the sole right to choose defense 
counsel.  
In contrast, under a “non-duty to defend” policy, the policyholder is able to use any lawyer of its 
choosing, subject to insurer approval (which is n early always agreed to, unless the selected counsel 
has little or no EPL claim handling experience).  
The Right to Control the Defense of  a Claim: Advantages and Disadvantages. 
The second key difference between a “non-duty to de fend” EPLI policy and a “duty to defend” policy 
is in the area of claim handling and control of th e defense process. Specifically, “non-duty to defend” 
programs allow the policyholder—not the insurer—to  create the “reputation” that the policyholder 
seeks to project because it permits the policyholder to  handle and settle claims. In contrast, under a 
“duty to defend” policy, the insurer typically has the absolute right to control the defense of the claim—by means of invoking the policy’s “h ammer” clause or co-i nsurance hammer clause 
(discussed earlier), if the insured wants the coverage afforded by the policy.  
Consider the following three corporate litigation philosophies. Insured Company A automatically settles all claims, regardless of merit, in an e ffort to close them as quickly as possible. Insured Chapter 10–Claims Manage ment, Defense Cost, and Special Conditions in 
Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
81 Company B vigorously resists frivolous claims by taking all such claims to trial, but is amenable to 
settling meritorious cases. Insured Company C takes all claims to trial, even meritorious claims, 
despite potential adverse consequences. Regardl ess of an insured company’s preferred approach, 
corporate policyholders generally favor the opportunity  to make the determina tion to settle or defend, 
rather than have this decision made for them by  an insurance company. A non-duty to defend EPL 
policy allows this, whereas a duty to defend policy does not. Under a non-duty to defend policy, Companies A, B, and C would have free hand to resolve claims in its respective preferred manner. Under a duty to defend form, the companies would not have such latitude. 
Despite the fact that a non-duty to defend policy allows an insured, rather than its insurer, to handle 
claims and decide to defend or settle individual cases, duty-to-defend policies confer an important 
advantage upon an insured. Specifically, a duty-to -defend provision may benefit an insured, as 
compared to a non-duty to defend policy, if the in sured is inexperienced in managing the complexities 
of employment litigation. Under such circumstances, an insured is generally better off if it delegates 
strategic claims management decisions to an insu rer rather than trying to make them internally. 
However, for firms that are more familiar w ith the details of the EPL claim handling process 
(typically larger companies which are more rou tinely faced with such claims), an EPLI policy 
containing non-duty to defend langua ge may be preferable. (It should be mentioned that there is 
generally no premium difference between a duty to defend and a non-duty to defend policy.)  
Insurer Obligation To Defend No n-Covered Claim Allegations 
The third important difference between duty to defend and non-duty to defend policies is that under the former, the insurer is obligated to defend all of the allegations in a lawsuit, as long as at least one 
such allegation is covered by the policy. The fo llowing scenario illustrates this point. A former 
employee with 20 years of service is terminated by an insured company. In her wrongful termination 
lawsuit, she alleges damages from lost wages, as we ll as the fact that prior to her termination, the 
company failed to pay her overtime (i.e., a wage and hour claim). 
Although damages arising from the first allegation ar e clearly covered by a standard EPL policy form, 
the wage-and-hour claim is excluded. However, sin ce coverage exists for the first allegation, an 
insurer, under a duty to defend policy, must also  defend the wage-and-hour claim (although it would 
not be liable for any potential damages). In contrast, under a non-duty to defend policy, the insurer 
would only be obligated to pay the costs of defending  the first allegation made in the claim. As this 
scenario illustrates, "all allegations" defense cove rage, which is available under a duty to defend 
form, but not under a non-duty to defend policy, is advantageous for an insured. 
Defense Cost Provisions 
In addition to covering claim settle ments and judgments, EPLI policies pay the costs required to settle 
or defend claims. Such items typically involve: (1) a ttorneys’ and adjusters’ fees and expenses, (2) the 
cost of legal proceedings including mediation and arbitration, (3) the cost of appeal bonds, and (4) 
pre- and post-judgment interest. Under some, but not all, insurers’ forms, defense costs also include 
costs that the insured must incur while assisting the insurer during the defense and investigation of 
claims (subject to a per day limit of $100 to $250), such as attending tr ials or depositions. 
Expenditure of Defense Costs Reduce Policy Limits 
Under virtually all EPL policies, the expenditure of defense costs reduces the limits available to pay 
claims. Given the high costs of defending EPL clai ms, insureds should bear this “shrinking limits” 
factor in mind when deciding on how much coverage to purchase.  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
82 One key factor to consider when selecting EPLI policy limits is that, in addition to settlements and 
judgments associated with employment-related cl aims, defense costs such as legal fees, adjusting 
expenses, and court costs are also covered by EPLI  policies. And under virt ually all EPLI policies, 
payment of defense costs reduces available policy limits. (This is in contrast to the approach used in 
commercial general liability (CGL) policies, in whic h defense costs are paid in addition to policy 
limits.) Often, defense costs can far exceed the actual settlement fi gure or judgment rendered against 
an insured in employment-related claims. Accordingly, in addition to projecting potential judgment and settlement amounts, careful consideration s hould be given to likely defense costs when 
attempting to select an appropriate limit of coverage under an EPLI policy form. 
Special Conditions  
EPL policies are written with several special conditions  that can have a considerable effect on the 
application of coverage. These conditions include: (1) provisions that reduce deductible amounts, (2) 
other insurance provisions, a nd (3) value-added provisions. 
Provisions that Reduce Deductible Amounts under EPL Policies 
Some insurers will allow insureds to reduce the am ount of the deductible/retention specified in the 
declarations page of the policy. Specifically, insurers sometimes assent to such reductions if insureds agree to: 
• Report “incidents” to the insurer before th ey mature into formal “claims,” or  
• Consult with an employment attorney (designated by the insurer) prior to making any termination decisions, or  
• Have employee sign mandatory arbitration agreements. 
Typically such reductions are 50 percent of the regular policy deductible/retention so that, for 
example, a $10,000 deductible would be reduced to  $5,000 if the insured agreed to any of these 
actions, prior to policy inception. 
Early Incident Reporting 
The thinking behind granting a reduced deductible in return for the early reporting of “incidents” is 
that it will encourage insureds to report potential claim circumstances well before a lawsuit is filed 
against the insured. As a general rule, the earlie r an insurer becomes involved in an employment-
related claim (or any claim, for that matter), the better the chance that it can be resolved without the 
employee hiring an attorney. And if, under these circ umstances, the employee does retain counsel, the 
probability of settling the claim without a trial is al so much improved if the insured promptly notifies 
the insurer of a potential claim.  
An Example 
After taking the company’s aptitude test, a job candida te is advised that he will not be offered the 
position for which he has applied. He immediately ca lls the company’s HR director and says “that test 
was used to discriminate against me and I’m going to sue you and the company for denying me a job 
for which I was totally qualified.”  
By immediately notifying the insurer of the potential claim associated with this sequence of events, 
the insurer will be in a better position to defend agains t a lawsuit, if one is eventually brought against 
its insured. Among other things, the insurer can exam ine the test that was administered, as well as the Chapter 10–Claims Manage ment, Defense Cost, and Special Conditions in 
Stand-Alone EPL Policies 
83 other information submitted by the applicant. Based on  such details, if a claim is eventually made, the 
insurer will be better equipped to decide: 
• if an expedited settlement offer is appropria te (perhaps the test did discriminate), or 
• if the claim is completely without merit (if th e test did not discriminate and the applicant was 
otherwise unqualified for the position), or  
• if some other course of action is appropriate. 
Regardless of the insurer’s initial assessment, the insured’s expedited notice of a possible claim will 
assist the insurer in the claim ma nagement process, a fact that w ill ultimately reduce the overall cost 
of the claim. This is the rationale for offering a lower deductible when an insured reports such 
incidents, before they result in a formal claim. 
Consulting with an Employment Atto rney Prior to Terminations 
By requiring an insured to contact employment coun sel designated by the insurer, prior to terminating 
any employee, an insured will receive the benefit of the lawyer’s expertise, which can assist in reducing claim potential under these circumstances. 
The manner in which a termination is handled has a significant impact on two key variables: (1) 
whether the employee will bring a wrongful termination lawsuit and (2) if a lawsuit is brought, the 
extent of the damages that he or she can collect. 
Accordingly, a number of EPL policy forms contain provisions allowing for a reduction in the 
policy’s deductible if the insured agrees to consult with an employment attorney prior to terminating 
employees.  
Mandatory Arbitrat ion Agreements 
Mandatory arbitration agreements, which preclude an employee from suing an employer, and instead require that employment disputes be settled by binding arbitration, provide the employer with a number of advantages in the claims settlement process. These advantages include avoidance of 
runaway jury awards, reduced costs compared to litiga tion, faster claim resolution, and removal of the 
dispute from public view. 
Given these positive features of the arbitration process,  insurers will also sometimes agree to reduced 
deductible provisions when an insured requires both new and existing employees to sign mandatory 
arbitration agreements. 
Other Insurance Provisions 
The purpose of “other insurance” provisions is to determine the order of priority for payment of 
claims when multiple policies cover a single loss. An “other insurance” provision in an EPLI policy is  needed if coverage for an employment-related 
claim is also available under another insurance polic y. Often, such coverage is in place under an EPLI 
endorsement to a D&O policy (which was discussed earlier in this course). Moreover, even if an 
insured corporation has not purchased an EPLI e ndorsement, D&O policies do not exclude coverage 
for employment practices liability exposures (although directors and officers would be the only 
persons insured under the policy). Therefore, duplicate coverage could exist if an insured company 
has a D&O policy, even in the absence of an EPLI endorsement to that policy. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
84 EPLI Policy Should Be Primary 
Under such circumstances, it is preferable that the other insurance provision make the EPLI policy 
expressly primary to the coverage afforded by eith er an EPLI endorsement on a D&O policy or to an 
unendorsed D&O policy. This is because it is not advisable to expose a D&O insurance program to 
employment-related loss experience, since doing so could mean not only premature exhaustion of the 
D&O policy, but also higher premiums for renewal policies.  
Therefore, insureds should seek language in the EPLI policy’s “other insurance” clause expressly 
making the coverage afforded by that policy to function as “primary” to the D&O policy.  
Loss Control Services 
Depending on the insurance company, EPLI polici es often come with loss control attached. These 
loss control services are provided at no cost or si gnificantly reduced cost to the EPLI policyholders. 
Their purpose is to reduce the insured’s exposure to  employment-related claims being made against 
them. When selecting among competing insurers, the nature, availability, and quality of value-added 
provisions and services should be carefully considered.  Just as the different insurers’ forms vary considerably  with respect to the scope of coverage, there is a 
correspondingly wide range of possible “value-added” services available. These services include the 
following. 
• A free human resources law compliance audit conducted by an attorney or human resources 
professional.  
• Personnel forms, software for creating employee handbooks, and other policies and 
procedures.  
• Training materials in print or online format.  
• Continuing education workshops aimed at pr esenting approaches that reduce and control 
claims.  
Online Self-Audits 
In recent years, a few insurers have begun to offer their insureds the ability to perform a self-audit of 
their human resources policies, using online computer  programs. The advantage of such programs is 
that they afford an employer the ability to verify that its policies and procedures are up-to-date. This 
is especially important, given the rapid and cont inuous changes in the laws applying to the 
employment process. These programs take the insured through a series of detailed questions and, based on the answers to the questions, the program provides an assessment of the areas in which the organization could be vulnerable to claims. Such programs offer valuable insight into a company’s 
human resources practices and target the activities mo st likely to give rise to employment practices 
liability litigation. 
Hot Lines 
Some insurers also provide access to “hot line services” manned by employment law attorneys or human resources specialists. Hot lines are an especially valuable service because they can assist in managing on-the-spot compliance issues, problems, and disputes, which can often prevent a claim 
from happening. There are two types of hot line services available: those that provide access to a 
human resources person and those affording contact with a labor-employment attorney. The latter are 
more valuable. Chapter 10–Claims Manage ment, Defense Cost, and Special Conditions in

repeated on-the-job trauma. The harassment claim is within the scope of the EPLI, but the 
medical fees are covered by workers comp ensation. Blue Suede’s insurer will: 
a. defend Blue Suede against the harassment claim only. 
b. defend Blue Suede against the medical expense claim only. 
c. defend Blue Suede against both the harassment claim and the medical expense claim.  
d. expect Blue Suede to provide its own defense against Sue’s claims. 
 
   
 
   
Answers to Chapter 10 Review Questions 
1. d. A “hammer clause” becomes operative when the insured and insurer cannot agree on a settlement 
figure proposed by the insurer. If the insured prefers to defend a claim rather than settle it, the insured 
must pay any additional amount for which the claim is eventually settled. 
2. c. Under a duty-to-defend policy, the insurer is obligated to defend all allegations in a lawsuit, as long 
as at least one such allegation is covered by the policy. Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage

87 Chapter 11 
Exclusions in EPL Policy Forms 
EPL forms differ significantly with respect to the actual wording of the exclusions they contain, 
which has a substantial impact on the actual scope of coverage a given policy provides. Often, a 
policy will exclude a particular exposure, but the policy’s exclusionary wording will also be written 
with “exception” wording that has the effect of “adding back,” and thus covering certain aspects of 
the otherwise excluded exposure. Chapter 11 an alyzes wording of the most common EPL policy 
exclusions, which are those pertaining to:  
• Criminal, fraudulent, or intentional acts 
• Bodily injury 
• WARN Act liability 
• Liability under workers compensation and similar laws 
• Contractual liability 
• Liability under the Americans With Disabilities Act 
• Strikes and lockouts 
• Wage and hour claims 
• Claims about which an insured had prior knowledge 
• Claims for nonpecuniary relief 
• Claims for breach of employment contracts 
• Claims for insurance benefits 
Criminal, Fraudulent, or Intentional Acts  
Virtually all of the policies preclude coverage for fraudulent, criminal, and intentional acts. However, 
nearly all insurers promise to defend allegations of  such acts until “final adjudication,” whereby it is 
judicially determined that an insured caused or is indeed responsible for intentionally causing an 
injury. 
In addition, such exclusions are usually written on a “severable” basis, whereby so-called innocent 
insureds who are accused of wrongful conduct will have defense coverage, although culpable 
insureds will not. For example, if three department managers are named in a sexual harassment 
lawsuit, but only one actually committed the harass ment, the other two innocent insureds will have Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
88 defense coverage under the policy. (In addition, the employer itself will also have defense and 
indemnity coverage available if the top manage ment was unaware of the wrongful conduct.)  
Bodily Injury 
Liability for claims involving bodily injury is ex cluded by EPL policies because such coverage for 
bodily injury is typically afforded under the CGL form.  
Key Exception Language 
However, nearly all versions of this exclusion “except,” and therefore cover, damages caused by: (1) 
emotional distress, (2) loss of reputation, (3) mental anguish, or (4) humiliation. This exception 
applies because employment-related claims frequently allege damages associated with such perils, 
which, if caused by employment-related acts, w ould not be covered under CGL policies given the 
broad exclusionary language in such polici es as respects employment-related claims.  
WARN Act Liability 
Under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraini ng Notification (WARN) Act, employers of 100 or 
more persons are required to give their workers specific notice periods prior to various types of mass layoffs or plant closings. The majority of EPL policies preclude coverage for claims alleging failure 
to provide such notice as required by this law. The rationale for the exclusion is that if claims result 
from failure to comply with the requirements of the WARN Act, such failure is within the control of 
the insured organization and could presumably have been avoided. 
Favorable WARN Act Language 
However, a favorable variation of th is exclusion is one in which there is an exception, and therefore 
coverage, for claims alleging WARN  Act violations, provided the insu red organization consulted with 
attorneys prior to the claim being made and attempte d, in good faith, to comply with the law, yet was 
sued nevertheless. 
Liability under Workers Comp ensation and Similar Laws 
Nearly all of the forms exclude coverage for th e insured’s obligations under workers compensation 
and similar laws, such as those requiring payment of disability and unemployment compensation benefits.  
Exception Language for Retaliation and Other Types of Claims 
The exclusion does, however, contain important exce ption language for various types of employment-
related claims. Specifically, such wording affords coverage by “excepting” retaliation and other types 
of employment-related claims if they are associated with acts involving workers compensation (or similar) laws. For example, there would be covera ge (for retaliation) if, after an employee files a 
workers compensation claim, her supervisor reta liates against her by sexua lly harassing or demoting 
her.  
Contractual Liability 
The vast majority of EPLI forms exclude covera ge for contractually assumed liability (i.e., an 
agreement to indemnify or hold a third party harmless).  Chapter 11–Exclusions in EPL Policy Forms 
89 Exception for Liability in the Absence of a Contract 
However, nearly all EPL policies contain an excep tion providing coverage for liability that would 
have attached in the absence of a contract. For ex ample, assume an insured organization agrees to 
indemnify an employment agency (that leases worker s to the insured organization) for the wrongful 
acts of the insured’s employees committed against the employment agency’s employees. Under these 
circumstances, the insured organization would be liable, even in the absence of the contract, to 
indemnify the employment agency. Consequently, if one of the insured’s employees harasses an employee of the employment agency, the contractua l liability exclusion will not apply and coverage 
will be available under the insured organization’s EPLI policy.  
Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) 
Loss arising from an insured’s failure to comply with any accommodations or building modifications for the disabled, as required by the ADA , is excluded by most EPLI forms. The effect of this 
exclusion is to preclude coverage if, for example,  an insured is required to install handicapped access 
ramps within its building. Insurers consider this  exposure a business risk and therefore exclude it. 
Coverage Is Not Excluded for Discrimination Based upon Disability 
However, this exclusion would not apply if, fo r example, a handicapped person were to allege 
discrimination because he or she was denied employment with an insured company. In effect, the 
purpose of the ADA exclusion is to preclude coverage  for the cost of making physical modifications 
rather than to eliminate coverage if it is alleged that an insured discriminated on the basis of a 
plaintiff’s disability.  
Exception Wording Covers Defense Costs 
Some versions of this exclusion contain exception wording that affirmatively provides coverage for 
the costs of defending claims alleging violation of  the ADA, which is, of course, favorable for the 
insured.  
Strikes and Lockouts 
Most, although not all, of the forms exclude c overage for claims by employees who are striking, 
locked out, or temporarily or permanently replaced . Most insurers’ forms contain this exclusion, 
although it is doubtful that other insurers would provi de coverage for such claims, since this is a 
business risk.  
Wage and Hour Claims 
Virtually all EPLI policies exclude coverage for what are known as “wage and hour claims.” 
Employees are either “exempt” or “nonexempt.” Exempt employees need not be paid overtime, 
whereas nonexempt employees are owed such wag es. Wage and hour claims arise from an 
employer’s alleged failure to pay overtime to em ployees who should have been treated as nonexempt 
employees and are therefore eligible to receive overtime pay. 
The key federal law governing the payment of overt ime wages is known as the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, enacted in 1938. In some instances, wage a nd hour laws in individual states apply even more 
stringent standards as to which employees are eligible to receive overtime pay.  Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
90 The most common misconception associated with wa ge and hour claims is that simply because 
someone receives a salary, rather than an hourly wage, that they are exempt from receiving overtime 
pay. However, in 2007, Staples stores paid $38 million (i.e., $22,000 each) to a group of salaried 
assistant managers who were allegedly misclassified as exempt under the overtime laws. 
Coverage for Defense of Wage and Hour Claims 
In response to such claim trends, a handful of insurers have begun to offer defense (but not 
indemnity) coverage for wage and hour claims.  
Limits Available 
Under these policy forms, coverage for defense is  provided, subject to a sublimit (most often 
$100,000 or $250,000). As a result, payments fo r defending wage and hour claims do not reduce the 
policy’s annual aggregate that is available for ot her types of employment-related claims; rather, the 
policy’s wage and hour defense sublimit is a who lly separate amount of coverage, a fact that is 
advantageous for the insured.  
This defense coverage is written on a first-dolla r basis, meaning that it is not subject to a 
deductible/retention, which is yet another advantageous feature for insureds. 
No Special Underwr iting Requirements 
Additionally, under such policies, there is typically no requirement that the insured undergo an audit 
(to evaluate the extent of the company’s wage a nd hour exposure). Rather, insurers will agree to 
provide the coverage on the basis of the insured’s answers to questions on the application, pertaining 
to its wage and hour exposures.  
The new product is a boon to employers—especially smaller ones—previously left to defend against 
this costly and increasingly common litigati on without the benefit of insurance.  
Exception for Coverage of Claims under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
In addition to the defense coverage of wage and hour claims that has become available, most insurers’ 
wording of the wage and hour exclusion modifies the exclusion so it does not apply to claims 
associated with the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963.  This law, which prohibits discrimination in 
determining the wages of male and female employees, mandates equal pay for both sexes when work involves equal levels of skill, effort, and responsibility. While this law does not involve the typical 
wage and hour claim, absent a clarifying endorsement , an insurer could stretch the intended scope of 
this exclusion and deny coverage for a clai m alleging violation of the Equal Pay Act.  
Prior Knowledge of Potential Claims 
Nearly all EPLI policies exclude coverage for clai ms produced by circumstances or incidents about 
which the insured had knowledge, prior to policy in ception, about incidents or circumstances that 
have the potential to result in claims. This exclusion is appropriate because the purpose of EPLI 
policies is to cover only fortuitous circumstances about which the insured had no knowledge prior to 
the inception of the policy.  
 
 
 Chapter 11–Exclusions in EPL Policy Forms 
91 Problems with the Prior Knowledge Exclusion 
However, the exclusion as sometimes written can be a frequent source of claim denials. Specifically, 
if a prior knowledge exclusion states that knowledge of an incident or circumstance by an “insured” 
or “employee” is excluded, coverage would, for example, be precluded in scenarios where 
employees—but not management personnel—had knowle dge of circumstances that could give rise to 
a claim.  
An Example of How the Excl usion Could Create Problems 
After being terminated, an employee tells a co-worker, “I'm going to see my lawyer about this.” Following the incident, the coworker does not advise his supervisor. If an investigation by the insurer 
receiving the claim revealed that an employee was aw are of such circumstances, a claim denial could 
result. 
Only Knowledge by Officers, Managers, or  HR Department Supervisors Should Be 
Considered “Prior Knowledge” 
Accordingly, a prior knowledge exclusion should be  written so that it precludes coverage only if one 
of the following, a: (1) supervisor, (2) officer, (3 ) manager, or (4) HR manager had prior knowledge 
of the circumstances surrounding a potential claim. A number of insurers, but not all, offer such 
wording.  
Nonpecuniary Relief 
Most of the policies exclude coverage for nonmoneta ry damages. Coverage of such damages, also 
known as “injunctive relief” (e.g., as reinstatement of  a terminated employee), is beyond the intended 
scope of EPLI forms because insurance policies are cont racts to pay money rather than to perform or 
enforce the performance of services. 
Exception for Defense Costs 
Favorable versions of this exclusion “except,” and th erefore cover, the costs required to defend claims 
seeking nonpecuniary relief, which can be considerable.  
Breach of Employment Contracts  
Most EPL forms exclude coverage for damages accruing when the in sured organization breaches an 
employment contract. Such exclusions also precl ude payment of the severance amounts provided by 
such contracts. The rationale for the exclusion is th at the insured was in control of this exposure when 
it entered into the employment contract, as well as when it terminated the contract. Thus, such circumstances are considered uninsurable risks that  involve business decisions (i.e., the decision to 
hire that particular person, under a specific set of conditions). For example, the CEOs of major 
corporations often obtain employment contracts stating that they cannot be fired without just cause and that if they are terminated without such cause,  they will receive a stipulated lump-sum payment. 
If a former CEO were to bring a claim based upon su ch a contract, there would be no coverage under 
an EPL policy.  
   Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
92 Defense and Indemnity Cost E xception for “Implied” Contracts 
There are, however, favorable versions of this ex clusion that do provide coverage of both defense 
costs and indemnity expenses associated with alle gations that the insured organization breached an 
“implied” employment contract. One rationale for this exception is that former employees sometimes 
assert, for example, that an offer letter, which specified a certain salary and level of benefits, 
constituted an “implied contract of employment.” In other instances, employee lawsuits have cited 
that material in employee handbooks created an im plied contract of employment. For this reason, 
some insurers’ forms agree to fu lly cover such claims which allege breach of implied employment 
contracts.  
Defense Cost Exception for “Exp licit” Employment Contracts 
A handful of EPL insurers’ forms go a step further and provide defense coverage, for claims made in 
conjunction with explicit employment contracts (i.e., those for a specific term of years, which include 
actual compensation amounts, and usually specify that  damages will be due unless the person, usually 
an executive, is terminated without cause.) However,  virtually no EPL insurers’ form cover indemnity 
payments associated with such explicit employment contracts. 
Insurance Benefits 
Nearly all EPLI forms contain exclusions precluding coverage for insurance benefits. One rationale 
underlying this approach is that obligations to  provide employee benefits are business risks and 
therefore do not fall within the scope of coverage intended by EPLI policies.  
Another justification for this exclusion is to preclude coverage for a risk that could also possibly be 
covered by fiduciary/employee be nefit liability insurance policies.  For example, assume that an 
employee was told by the benefits administrator at a company that his retirement pension would be $2,000 per month. In reality, when he retires, his monthly benefit is only $1,200. If he sues the 
company for the difference between the promised and the actual benefit amount, this exclusion will 
preclude coverage, which is appropr iate since this type of claim would be covered by a fiduciary 
liability policy form.  
On the other hand, this exclusion could also bar cove rage if, as part of a wrongful termination claim, a 
former employee claims a loss of health insu rance resulting from his termination. Absent an 
exception in this exclusion for loss of benefits as a result of wrongful termination, no coverage would 
apply. Still another reason for excluding insurance plan be nefits is that their actual cost, on a long-term, 
“going-forward” basis, is highly speculative. As poi nted out earlier, health insurance premium cost 
increases during the past 20 years have varied considerably, a fact making it difficult to predict the 
actual cost of such benefits that many years into the future.  
Exception for Coverage of Benefits as a Part of Claim Settlements 
Fortunately, favorable versions of  this exclusion “except” from their definitions of “benefits,” and 
therefore cover, insurance benefits when they are part of claim settlements or judgments associated 
with wrongful termination claims.

Chapter 11 Review Questions  
1. ABC employment agency leases workers to C&C Contractors, which is insured under an EPL 
policy that contains a typical contractual liability exclusion. C&C has agreed to indemnify 
ABC for any wrongful acts that C&C employees commit against ABC employees. If a C&C employee harasses an ABC employee: 
a. C&C’s contractual liability coverage will apply because of the indemnification 
agreement.  
b. C&C’s EPLI coverage will apply because liability exists independently of the 
indemnification agreement. 
c. C&C has no coverage because harassmen t does not qualify as a wrongful act.  
d. C&C has no coverage because of the contractual liability exclusion in its EPLI policy. 
2. Goldie, a Locks Company employee, told a cowo rker that continuing sexual harassment by 
another coworker was making her job unbearable , but she had not filed a complaint because 
she needed the job. Locks’ EPLI policy excludes coverage for incidents or circumstances that 
have the potential to produce claims if an insured had knowledge of it prior to policy 
inception. This exclusion: 
a. can lead to a denied harassment claim si nce an employee knew of Goldie’s alleged 
harassment. 
b. ensures that any claim Goldie makes will be covered. 
c. ensures that management personnel will repor t such incidents in the new or renewal 
application so the underwriter can de termine how best to handle it.  
d. reduces Locks’ premium without sacrificing important coverage.

95 Chapter 12 
Coverage Triggers in EPL Policies 
Chapter 12 examines the coverage triggers found wi thin EPL policies, all of which are written on a 
claims-made basis.  
Operation of Claims-Made Coverage Triggers 
EPLI policies are written on what are known as a “claims-made” basis, which requires that two 
conditions be met for c overage to apply.  
First, the claim must be “first made” against the insured during the policy term. This means that for 
coverage to apply, the claim must not have previ ously been made against the insured during a policy 
with an earlier term of coverage.  
Second, coverage applies only if the act giving rise to a claim takes place on or after the policy’s 
“retroactive date.”  
Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates in EPL insurance po licies state that for coverage to apply, the wrongful act giving 
rise to a claim must have taken place on or afte r the retroactive date specified by the policy’s 
declarations page. Thus, retroactive dates preclude coverage for cl aims stemming from acts that took 
place before a policy’s retroactive date. 
Purpose of Retroactive Dates 
Retroactive dates have the effect of excluding coverage for possible wrongful acts committed in 
conjunction with some known event (i.e., known to the insured) that took place prior to policy 
inception. They also preclude coverage for wrongful acts that took place far in the past—even if 
unknown to the insured. 
Retroactive Dates in Policies for First-Time EPL Buyers 
Retroactive dates are sometimes included in EPLI pol icies for firms that are buying coverage for the 
first time. This is because underwriters are reluctant to offer “full prior acts coverage” (i.e., policies without retroactive dates) under such circumstances. Their concern is that the insured’s sudden desire 
to obtain a policy may have been prompted by the need to obtain coverage for circumstances they 
suspect could produce a claim in the future. Howeve r, even if additional premium is required, the 
first-time buyer of EPL coverage should purchase a policy that does not contain a retroactive date (or at least a retroactive date coinciding with the commencement of the company’s operations), if such 
coverage is available. Otherwise,  no coverage will be available for claims that are made against the Employment Practices Liability Expos ures and Insurance Coverage 
96 insured during the policy period if the insurer can de monstrate that they were caused by acts taking 
place prior to the inception of the policy. This coul d have the effect of excluding coverage for a 
significant portion of the insured’s exposure to employment-related claims. 
Retroactive Dates in Policies fo r Companies Currently Insured 
On the other hand, for a company that already h as an EPLI policy in place with another insurer, a 
replacement insurer should include a retroactive date  that is no later than the retroactive date found 
within the current policy, unless the insurer has a specific underwriting reason for excluding coverage 
based on known, specific events.  
Discovery Provisions 
Circumstances often arise under which it is probable that an act or omission will eventually cause a 
claim to be made against a company, despite the fact that litigation may not be initiated for some 
time. To address this problem, virtually all of the policies are written with what are called discovery provisions (also known as “awareness provisions” or “notice of claim provisions”). These allow the insured to advise the insurer—during the policy peri od—of situations that could later produce a claim 
against the insured. In the even t such situations do produce a future claim, the claim will be 
considered to have been “made” during the policy pe riod in which the insured originally notified the 
insurer. At that point, despite the fact that the act ual claim is made against the insured long after the 
policy period has terminated, coverage applies nonetheless.  
Extended Reporting Periods 
If an insured cancels or nonrenews an EPLI policy, unless a replacement policy is purchased that contains a retroactive date that is the same as  (or earlier than) the policy being canceled or 
nonrenewed, there will be a gap in coverage. To prevent such a gap, an insured can purchase an 
“extended reporting period (ERP) endorsement.” An ERP covers claims that took place during the 
expired or canceled policy but are made against th e insured during the extended reporting period. The 
ERP does not, however, cover claims produced by wrongful acts that took place during the ERP itself; it only covers claims made against the insured and reported to the insurer during the ERP.  
 
Chapter 12 Review Question  
1. To trigger coverage under a claims-mad e policy, the claim must be made: 
a. after the retroactive date for an act occurring during the policy period.  
b. before the retroactive date for an act occurring during the policy period. 
c. during the policy period for an act that occurred on or after the retroactive date.  
d. during the policy period for an act that occurred before the retroactive date. 
 
 
Answer to Chapter 12 Review Question 
1. c. For claims-made coverage to apply, (1) the claim must be first made during the policy term and (2) 
the act giving rise to the claim must take place on or after the policy’s retroactive date.
