1 Introduction 
 
Standard residential and commercial property insurance policies that cover buildings and their contents 
normally exclude coverage for flood losses. Flood dama ge was traditionally considered uninsurable due 
to the widespread and catastrophic nature of many floods, and individuals and businesses had no way to 
insure themselves against the fina ncial consequences of a flood loss. 
In response to the need for flood insurance that pr ivate insurers could not meet, Congress passed the 
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 . This Act established a form of government insurance against flood 
losses and created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) . Coverage under the NFIP is 
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  and underwritten by the federal 
government. NFIP insurance policies can be sold to individuals, families, and businesses by regular 
insurance agents and brokers who also sell other types of property insurance. 
This course covers topics in FEMA’s outline of “m inimum training and edu cation requirements, as 
required by Section 207 of the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, for all insurance agents who sell 
Standard Flood Insurance Policies issued thro ugh the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).”1 This 
course goes beyond the minimum requirements by adding u seful information that makes the details more 
understandable.  
The NFIP is unusual in several ways. Unlike most in surance programs that were developed by private 
insurers, the NFIP was designed by the government b ased on legislation developed in Congress, so it does 
not always follow conventional insurance practice. Th e unique nature of the flooding hazard also requires 
approaches that address both risk financing and risk  control. The NFIP is designed not only to 
compensate people whose property has been damaged by a flood but also to recognize, encourage, and 
reward efforts to mitigate flood damage. 
The language of flood insurance is unique, involving  specialized jargon and heavy use of acronyms. The 
NFIP’s Flood Insurance Manual2 and other resources include technical terms and acronyms that the agent 
must understand and some common in surance terms that take on a sp ecial meaning when used by the 
NFIP. The key terms are defined as they are introduced  and are also defined in the course’s Glossary. 
 
 
 
2 Course Objectives

requirements for agents who sell flood insuran ce. More specifically, you should be able to 
 identify, define, and use key techni cal terms associated with the NFIP; 
 explain the background, purposes, and development of the NFIP; 
 identify events that do or do not fall within an NFIP policy’s definition of “flood”; 
 explain what properties are eligible for NFIP  coverage under the emer gency program and the 
regular program; 
 describe the important role of flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and distinguish among various 
flood zones shown on rate maps; 
 describe in general the process of obtaining cove rage directly from NFIP or through the Write-
Your-Own (WYO) Program; 
 outline the process for determining flood insurance rates and describ e the factors considered in 
rating; 
 describe general rules and procedures associated with handling NFIP applications and policies; 
 identify the types of property and describe the pe ril that can be covered under a standard NFIP 
policy; and 
 describe the respective responsib ilities of NFIP policyholders and agents in handling flood 
claims. 
   
3 Chapter 1 
Overview of NFIP 
Overview 
 
This chapter begins with the technical definition of “flood” and explains why flood insurance is needed. It 
then explains what property is eligible for flood insurance and the role of flood maps. The chapter 
concludes by explaining how flood insurance coverage can be arranged.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify, define, and use key techni cal terms associated with the NFIP; 
 explain the background, purposes, and development of the NFIP; 
 explain what properties are eligible for NFIP  coverage under the emer gency program and the 
regular program; 
 describe the important role of FIRMs and dis tinguish among various flood zones shown on rate 
maps; and 
 describe in general the process of obtaining cove rage directly from NFIP or through the WYO 
Program. 
Floods and Flood Insurance 
First we must understand what is meant by “flood ” and why floods require a special approach to 
insurance. 
 
 
 
4 What Is a Flood? 
A flood  is a great flowing or overflowing of water, esp ecially over land areas that are normally dry. NFIP 
flood insurance policies use a more specific definition.  
Flood  is a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres 
of normally dry land area or of two or more properti es (one of which is your property) from one of 
the following:  
 Overflow of inland or tidal waters   
 Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source   
 Mudflow  
 Collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a 
result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding 
anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood as defined above   
A water event that does not meet this definition is not, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP), a “flood.”  
There are several types of flooding.  
 Coastal flooding  occurs when hurricanes and storms pr oduce heavy rains or drive ocean water 
onto land. Storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes can create tidal waves that produce coastal 
flooding. The force of the water from tidal waves often sweeps away  beaches and houses. 
 River flooding  is normally seasonal because of snowmelt or  heavy rains. Water fills the river 
basin too quickly, and the river flows over its banks. Water then covers the floodplain , often 
damaging homes, and other property.  
 Flash flooding  is caused when small and powerful fast-fl owing rivers are quickly formed because 
of excessive rainfall or dam failure, sometimes triggering catastrophic mudslides. Flash floods 
can be powerful enough to carry away roads, bri dges, and other structures, and they can occur 
with little advance warning.  
Loss Control Measures 
Floods cause major water damage to homes, and they can cause walls and entire buildings to collapse. 
Many homes caught in a flood are total losses. Property ow ners can take various measures to protect their 
homes and businesses, incl uding the following: 
 Elevate the structure. 
 Relocate the structure. 
 Relocate or elevate electrical panel boxes, fu rnaces, washers/dryers, and water heaters to a 
location less likely to be flooded. 
 Seal the structure. 
FEMA provides detailed informa tion in its publication titled Design Manual for Retrofitting Flood Prone 
Residential Structures , which can be ordered from FEMA. 
Need for Flood Insurance  
Most property insurance coverage forms exclude fl ood coverages. (Notable exceptions include auto 
insurance policies and inland marine floaters, which often include flood coverage.) Since most property 
forms do not typically cover flood losses, all propert y owners should seriously  consider procuring 
separate flood insurance.   
5 Flooding and Probability  
Many locations have a 1 percent or more probability  that that location will experience a flood in any 
given year. It’s important to understand exactly  what this means and what it doesn’t mean. 
A 1 percent probability is the same as saying they can expect 1 flood every 100 years on average in the 
long run.  This is no guarantee that the property will not have  2 or more floods within a 2- or 3-year period 
or even within the same year.  
Why Flood Insurance Is Better Than Disaster Assistance 
Disaster assistance might become available, but it is  available only if a disaster is federally declared. 
When it is available, assistance is usually a loan that mu st be repaid in full with interest. Flood insurance, 
however, indemnifies the insured for covered losses—e ven when a disaster is not federally declared. 
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) 
The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968  established the NFIP as a federally funded and operated 
program. Flood insurance is available from the NFIP , which is administered by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).  
The National Flood Insurance Act was amended in 1969 to provide coverage for mudslides. A 1973 
amendment required mortgage lenders, in most cases, to ensure that flood-plain property was covered by 
flood insurance. 1994 legislation tightened the enforcement of flood insurance requirements.  
The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters)3 made further modifications to 
various aspects of the NFIP. But in passing the Ho meowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, 
Congress rescinded some of the changes that Biggert-Waters had called for. 
NFIP Coverage Forms 
There are three different NFIP coverage forms: 
 The dwelling form  can be used to cover one- to four-fa mily dwellings. It cannot be used for 
residential structures with five or more residential units. 
 The general property form  covers other residential buildings of five families or more and 
nonresidential buildings. This flood form insures most businesses. 
 The residential condominium buildi ng association policy (RCBAP)  provides coverage for the 
condominium association, not individual unit owne rs. This policy covers the common elements 
and all structural items of the residential condom inium units within a building. It also covers 
personal property owned by the condominium association. 
Where Property Is Eligible for Flood Insurance 
FEMA has identified high-risk flood areas, known as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) where flood 
insurance is essentially mandatory. Pr operties in these areas have a 1 percent or greater chance of being 
flooded in any given year ( 100-year floodplain ).  
Participating Communities 
Properties do not need to be located in SFHAs to qua lify for NFIP flood coverage. However, they do need 
to be located in a participating community . To become a participating community, a community must 
adopt a floodplain management ordinance that meet s or exceeds minimum NFIP criteria and have a Flood 
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Fl ood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  
 
6 Participation in NFIP is a two-stage process, be ginning with the community’s participation in the 
emergency flood program . The second stage of participation is the regular flood program . Higher limits 
of coverage are available under the regular program. 
Emergency Program 
The emergency program, the initial phase of a community ’s participation in the NFIP, exists when the 
community has adopted floodplain management standard s, but no Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) is 
yet available. Pending the creation of a FIRM, which will identify all of the flood hazard zones in the 
community, properties in an emergency program commun ity are eligible for flood insurance at emergency 
program rates and subject to em ergency program maximum limits.  
The same emergency program rates apply to all insured properties, whether or not they are located within 
a floodplain. However, the maximum amount of insurance available is limited.  
Regular Program 
Once a detailed engineering study is completed fo r the community and a Flood Insurance Rate Map 
(FIRM) is issued, the community is brought into the regular program of the NFIP. Under the regular 
program, higher amounts of flood insurance coverage  are provided than under the emergency program. 
Regular program communities must agree to adopt  and enforce certain floodplain management 
regulations, including building cons truction and zoning laws that minimize the risks of flood damage.  
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) 
A FIRM  is an official map of a community on whic h the FEMA has delineated the SFHAs, the base flood 
elevations (BFEs), and the flood zones applicable to the community.  
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) 
The BFE is the elevation of surface water resulting from a flood that has a 1 percent chance of equaling or 
exceeding that level in any given year. The BFE is shown on the FIRM zones AE, AH, A1–A30, AR, 
AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1–A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1–V30, and VE. 
In essence, the BFE outlines the border of the 100-year floodplain. Property below th is line is in the 100-
year floodplain, also known as the Special Flood Hazar d Area (SFHA); property above this line is not. 
However, property outside the 100-year floodplain is not immune from flooding. It only means that the probability of a flood is a bit lower. Over the past decade, approximately 20 percent of all NFIP claims 
came from properties in low- to moderate-risk areas. 
Flood Zones 
Flood maps of communities that participate in the NF IP indicate the degree of flood hazard in various 
specific areas referred to as zones .  
Special Hazard Flood Areas (SFHAs) are defined as th e areas that will be inundated by the flood event 
having a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceed ed in any given year. The 1-percent annual chance 
flood is also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood. SFHAs are labeled as zones A, AO, AH, A1–
A30, AE, A99, AR, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/A1–A30, AR/A, V, VE, and V1–V30.  
Moderate flood hazard areas , labeled Zone B or Zone X (shaded)  are also shown on the FIRM and are 
the areas between the limits of the base flood and th e 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood. The 
areas of minimal flood hazard , which are the areas outside the SFHA a nd higher than the elevation of the 
0.2-percent-annual-chance flood, are labeled Zone C or Zone X. 
A more specific description of these map zones is shown in Exhibit 1.1.  
7 Exhibit 1.1  
Definitions of FEMA Flood Zone Designations  
Flood zones are geographic areas that FEMA has define d according to varying levels of flood risk. These 
zones are depicted on a community’s FIRM. Each zone  reflects the severity or type of flooding in the 
area.  
Moderate- to Low-Risk Areas  
In communities that participate in the NFIP, flood insurance is available to all property owners and 
renters in these zones:  
ZONE DESCRIPTION 
B and X (shaded)   Area of moderate flood hazard, usually  the area between the limits of the 
100-year and 500-year floods. Are also used to designate base floodplains of lesser hazards, such as areas protected by levees from 
100-year flood, or shallow flooding areas with average depths of less than 
one foot or drainage areas less than one square mile.  
C and X (unshaded)   Area of minimal flood hazard, usually depicted on FIRMs as above the 
500-year flood level  
 
 
 
 
    
 
     
 
    
 
  
 
8 High-Risk Areas  
In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
apply to all of these zones:  
ZONE  DESCRIPTION  
A  Areas with a 1% annual chance of flooding and a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 
30-year mortgage. Because detailed analyses ar e not performed for such areas, no depths 
or BFEs are shown within these zones.  
AE  The base floodplain where BFEs are provided. AE zones are now used on new format 
FIRMs instead of A1–A30 zones.  
A1–30   These are known as numbered A zones (e.g., A7  or A14). This is the base floodplain where 
the FIRM shows a BFE (old format).  
AH  Areas with a 1% annual chance of shallow flooding, usually in the form of a pond, with an 
average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over 
the life of a 30-year mortgage. BFEs derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected 
intervals within these zones.  
AO  River or stream flood hazard areas and areas with a 1% or greater chance of shallow 
flooding each year, usually in the form of sheet flow, with an average depth ranging from 1 
to 3 feet. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage. 
Average flood depths derived from detailed analyses are shown within these zones.  
AR  Areas with a temporarily increased flood risk due to the building or restoration of a flood 
control system (such as a levee or a dam). Mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirements will apply, but rates will not exceed the rates for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built or restored in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations.  
A99  Areas with a 1% annual chance of flooding that will be protected by a federal flood control 
system where construction has reached specified legal requirements. No depths or BFEs are shown within these zones.  
 
High Risk: Coastal Areas  
In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
apply to all of these zones:  
ZONE  DESCRIPTION  
V  Coastal areas with a 1% or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated 
with storm waves. These areas have a 26% c hance of flooding over the life of a 30-year 
mortgage. No BFEs are shown within these zones.  
VE, V1–30  Coastal areas with a 1% or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated 
with storm waves. These areas have a 26% c hance of flooding over the life of a 30-year 
mortgage. BFEs derived from detailed analys es are shown at selected intervals within 
these zones.  
 
 
   
9 Undetermined Risk Areas  
ZONE DESCRIPTION  
D  Areas with possible but undetermined flood hazards. No flood hazard analysis has been 
conducted. Flood insurance rates are commensurat e with the uncertainty of the flood risk.  
Community Participation/Eligibility 
A community has many incentives to pa rticipate in the NFIP. For exampl e, if an officially declared 
disaster occurs as a result of flooding in a nonparticipa ting community, no federal financial assistance will 
be granted for the permanent repair or reconstruction of insurable build ings in these areas. In addition, a 
lender can offer only a conventional loan (a loan no t guaranteed or insured by the federal government) in 
a community that does not participate in the NFIP. The lender is still required to inspect any flood maps 
to determine flood hazard risk and provide notice of this risk. A lender that recognizes the flood risk to 
financed property may require a borrower to obtain flood insurance even without a federally mandated 
requirement.  
Community Rating System (CRS) 
The CRS, a voluntary program for NFIP-particip ating communities, encourages flood mitigation 
activities, by providing financial incentives (premium di scounts) for policyholders in communities that go 
beyond the minimum floodplain management require ments and develop extra measures to provide 
protection from flooding. More than 1,300 communities currently participate in the CRS. 
For a community to be eligible, it must be in full co mpliance with the NFIP and be in the regular phase of 
the program.  
CRS classes range from class 1 to class 10. All commun ities begin with a class 10 rating, which provides 
no discount. A class 1 rating earns the largest premium discount of 45 percent.  
Eighteen activities in four categories—public info rmation, mapping and regul ation, flood damage 
reduction, and flood preparedness – are recognized as measures for reducing the exposure to floods. 
Credit points are assigned to each activity. Once a comm unity applies to the appropriate FEMA region for 
the CRS program and its implementation is verifi ed, FEMA establishes the CRS classification based on 
the credit points allowed.  
Building Property Eligibility 
Flood insurance may be written only on a structure with  two or more outside rigid walls and a fully 
secured roof affixed to a permanent site. Structures must  resist flotation, collapse, and sideways motion. 
Usually at least 51 percent of the actual cash valu e (ACV) of the property, including machinery and 
equipment that are a part of the building, must be above ground level.4 4  
Manufactured Homes 
Manufactured or mobile homes , along with travel trailers, may be  eligible, but they have separate 
eligibility standards. A manufactured or mobile home is defined as a structure built on a permanent 
chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation.  
A travel trailer without wheels is also eligible if it is built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent 
foundation, provided it is regulated under the co mmunity’s floodplain management and building 
ordinances or laws.  
  
 
10 Two different eligibility rules that apply to manuf actured homes are based on how long the flood policy 
has been in force. 
 For manufactured homes insured under policies that were effective on or after October 1, 1982, 
the home must be affixed to a permanent foundation.  It must also be anchored if located in an 
SFHA.  
 For manufactured homes on a foundation that have been continuously insured since September 
30, 1982, the requirements are not as rigorous.  
Other Structures 
Numerous other structures are considered eligible buildings, including the following. 
 Appurtenant structures  
 Silos and grain storage buildings 
 Cisterns 
 Buildings entirely over water that were construc ted or substantially impr oved before October 1, 
1982 
 Buildings partially over water,  under certain circumstances 
 Boathouses located partially over water, under certain circumstances 
 Buildings in the course of construction that ha ve yet to be walled and roofed except when 
construction has been stopped or delayed for more th an 90 days and/or if the lowest floor used for 
rating purposes is below the BFE 
 Severe repetitive loss properties5 
Ineligible Buildings 
The following buildings are among those typica lly ineligible for flood insurance coverage. 
 Buildings that are constructed or altered in a wa y that places them in violation of state or local 
floodplain management laws or regulations. C ontents and personal property located in these 
buildings are also ineligible.  
 Container-type structures, such as gas and liquid tanks, chemical or reactor container tanks and 
brick kilns, including their contents 
 Buildings entirely over water if they were newly constructed or substantia lly improved on or after 
October 1, 1982 
 Buildings partially underground, if 50 percent or  more of the structure’s ACV, including the 
machinery and equipment that are part of the building, is below ground level 
 Boat repair docks 
 Greenhouses (unless the structure has at least two rigid walls and a roof) 
     
11 Contents Eligibility 
To be eligible for coverage, contents must be locat ed in a fully enclosed bu ilding or secured to prevent 
flotation out of the building. Additional categor ies of eligible property include the following. 
 Vehicles and equipment—self-propelled vehicles or machines are eligible, provided they are not 
licensed for use on public roads and are (a) used pr imarily to service the described location or (b) 
designed and used to assist handicapped persons. Coverage applies only while the vehicles or 
machines are inside a building at the described location. 
 Contents located inside silos, gr ain storage buildings, and cisterns 
Arranging NFIP Flood Insurance Coverage 
Flood insurance is mandatory for most owners of mortgaged property located in an SFHA. This is 
because lenders that are federally regulated, supervi sed, or insured by federal agencies are not legally 
permitted to lend money on property in a flood plain z one when the community is participating in the 
NFIP unless the property is covered by flood insurance.  The amount of flood insurance required in this 
situation must be at least equal to the smallest of these three amounts: 
 The outstanding principal balance of the loan  
 The insurable value of the structure (not including land). (Under the dwelling form and the 
RCBAP, the insurable value is based on the build ing’s replacement cost; the general property 
form provides actual cash coverage on the building,  so the building’s insurable value is its ACV.) 
 The maximum amount of insurance available from th e NFIP. (Property is often worth more than 
the maximum amount of flood insurance offered by the NFIP.) 
This legal requirement has been poorly enforced in the past, partly because mort gages are often sold by 
one bank to another, and the pena lty for noncompliance has been only $350. Biggert-Waters encourages 
lenders to comply with flood insurance requireme nts by increasing the penalty to $2,000 per violation 
with no limit on annual penalties.6 
Biggert-Waters permits the use of private insurance to satisfy the mandatory purchase  requirement.7 
“Private flood insurance” does not refer to NFIP pol icies that private insurers issue under the WYO 
Program, but rather to insurance underwritten by a pr ivate insurance company using a different policy 
form. 
Lenders may purchase flood insurance on behalf of hom e owners who fail to buy it themselves and then 
bill the home owners for covera ge. This is referred to as force-placed insurance.  Within 30 days after 
receiving confirmation that a property owner has pur chased his or her own flood insurance, Biggert-
Waters requires mortgage lenders a nd servicers to terminate the for ce-placed insurance and refund any 
premiums or fees paid for any period of duplicate coverage.8 
At a real estate settlement, home buyers must now be  made aware that flood insurance is available under 
the NFIP or from a private insurer, and they must also be notified if the property they are buying is 
located in an SFHA.9 
Home owners with homes in moderate- to low-risk  flood zones may not be compelled to purchase flood 
insurance. But residential and commercial properties not subject to such obvious risks of flood damage 
can and do suffer flood losses. There is a tendency of those whose property is not subject to an obvious 
flood hazard (such as a nearby river that floods relia bly every spring or hurricane-related flooding in 
seaside communities) to discount the possibility of flood damage.  
Another reason why relatively fe w property owners purchase flood insurance is that many insurance 
agents find it difficult to arrange NFIP policies. The application and rating procedures for NFIP flood insurance are entirely separate from t hose used in arranging other coverages, and the program has some  
 
12 requirements that are burdensome for agents. Neverthel ess, the NFIP is often the only available source of 
flood insurance, particularly for home owners a nd commercial property owners with an obvious flood 
exposure.  
Agents who do not recommend or suggest flood insuran ce, when it is available, face the possibility of 
serious errors and omissions (E&O) claims.  
Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program 
NFIP flood policies can be issued directly by the NFIP or  by a private insurer that participates in NFIP’s 
WYO Program. WYO participating insurers write the c overage on their own “paper”—that is, policies are 
issued in the participating insurer’s name—but the NFIP reinsures the coverage 100 percent, so losses are 
borne entirely by the federal government. Policy langua ge and coverage are the same whether the policy 
is issued directly by the NFIP or by a WYO insurer. More information about the WYO Program is provided later in this course.

C. the house is within the 100-year floodplain. 
D. the house is outside the 500-year floodplain. 
5. An insurance agent speaking at a countrywide c onvention of agents and brokers informs them 
about the common reasons why only a fraction of pr operties exposed to the risk of flood damage 
is actually insured against flood. First, he points out that those who own properties that are not

Flood Maps and Rating 
Overview 
 
Understanding the different flood maps and the factors involved in rate determin ation are important in 
understanding how the National Floo d Insurance Program operates. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 describe the important role of flood insurance maps and distinguish am ong various flood zones 
shown on rate maps; 
 outline the process for determining flood insurance rates and describ e the factors considered in 
rating; and 
 identify, define, and use key techni cal terms associated with the NFIP. 
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) 
An FHBM is the official map of a community, i ssued by FEMA, in which the boundaries of the flood, 
mudflow, and related erosion areas possessing special h azards have been identified. It shows approximate 
areas of 100-year flood hazard. An FHBM is genera lly used for emergency program communities, but 
some communities with minimal flood hazards that ente r the regular program continue to use an FHBM, 
renamed as a FIRM. 
 
 
16 Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) 
A FIRM is the official map of a community on wh ich FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas 
and the risk premium zones for the designated comm unity. The date of an initial FIRM may determine 
whether a property is categorized as pre-FIRM or post-FIRM. This is relevant because flood insurance 
rates are different for pre-FIRM and post-FIRM properties. 
 A pre-FIRM  building is one for which construction or  substantial improvement occurred on or 
before December 31, 1974, or before th e effective date of an initial FIRM. 
 A post-FIRM  building is one for which construction or  substantial improvement occurred after 
December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM, whichever is later. 
Pre-FIRM buildings that are substantially improved can continue to be rated as pre-FIRM if certain 
conditions are met.  
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) 
A base flood is often referred to as a 100-year flood. This is not a flood that will only occur once every 
100 years. Rather it refers to a flood having a 1 per cent or greater probability of occurring in any given 
year. At a given location, a 100-year flood could happ en more than once in a relatively short period of 
time, or it could not happen for hundreds of years.  
BFE refers to the height of a base flood, usually in feet above sea level.10 When building a new structure 
in a flood hazard zone, the best way to protect prope rty and minimize damage is to build above the BFE 
and strictly follow all building codes. 
Zone Determination 
A zone—a geographical area shown on an FHBM or FI RM—reflects the severity or type of flooding in 
the area. Zone determination is one of the key step s necessary to determine the appropriate rate for flood 
insurance. For example, Zone V is a coastal area that tidal floods with a high wind velocity can inundate. 
(“V” stands for “velocity.”) Property in SFHAs w ould be classified in one of the numerous Zone A 
locales. Zones B, C, and X are in areas of moderate or minimal hazard, and Zone D consists of areas in 
which the flood hazard is undetermined.  
Types of Buildings 
The lowest level of any building is the level most susceptible to flood damage. For rating purposes, the 
NFIP distinguishes among the followi ng “building types” categories. 
 No basement/enclosure 
 With basement 
 With enclosure 
 Elevated on crawlspace 
 Non-elevated with subgrade crawlspace 
 Manufactured (mobile) homes 
Any building area with a floor below grade level on all sides qualifies as a basement . 
An elevated building  is a building that has no basement and that has its lowest elevated floor raised above 
ground level by foundation walls, posts , piers, pilings, or columns. An  enclosure such as a shed or a 
utility room might be found in the space under an elevated building.  
17 A crawlspace  is a space under the building where one must crawl because there is not enough room to 
stand. 
Premium Calculation 
The premium calculation steps for flood insurance po licies differ depending on whether the emergency 
program or the regular program is in effect.  
Emergency Program 
The emergency program is designed for communities that do not yet have a FIRM. The same emergency 
program rates apply to all insure d properties without regard to the flood hazard. Limited dollar amounts 
of coverage are available in this first phase.  
The rate structure for properties in emergency progr am communities is simple. The only variables are the 
nature of the insured property (building or cont ents) and whether the property is residential or 
nonresidential. 
Steps in Premium Calculation 
The emergency program calculation steps are as follows. 
1. Determine occupancy type: resi dential or nonresidential.  
2. Calculate premium using appropriate rates. 
3. Apply appropriate deductible factor if  an optional deductible is chosen. 
4. Add the reserve fund assessment fee. 
5. Add HFIAA surcharge and the federal policy fee. 
Introduced in the Homeowner Flood Insu rance Affordability Act (HFIAA), the HFIAA surcharge  fee is a 
flat fee intended to offset some of the other ch anges made by that act. Policies on primary residences 
include a $25 surcharge, and all other policies include a $250 surcharge. The federal policy fee  is a flat 
administrative charge that applies to all flood policies. The reserve fund assessment fee  is an amount 
dedicated to the NFIP Reserve Fund as authorized by  the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 
2012. 
Regular Program  
The second and final stage of a community’s particip ation is the regular flood program. A community 
becomes a participant in the regular program on ce its flood hazard zones have been identified and 
published in a FIRM. Regular program communities must agree to adopt and enforce certain  floodplain 
management  regulations, including building construction and zoning laws that minimize the risks of flood 
damage.  
Rates applicable to properties in regular program communities vary based on a number of factors. The 
most important is the flood hazard zone in which the property is located.  
The applicable zone can be found on the FIRM for the community in which the property is located. 
Alternatively, the applicable zone for a particular  property can be obtained from the permits or building 
department of the community’s city or county gove rnment office. Flood maps are available from these 
offices or the NFIP.  
Sections of flood maps (referred to as FIRMettes ) are also available free of charge via the Internet on the 
NFIP’s website. Instructions on how to access and print a FIRMette are provided in the “FEMA Flood 
Map Service Center” section of the NFIP website.11  
 
18 Rates applicable to properties constructed after the date the initial flood map of the community was issued 
and located in the most hazardous zones also vary depending on the elevation of the building’s lowest 
floor  above the area’s BFE.  
Steps in Premium Calculation 
The regular program premium calculation steps are as follows. 
1. Determine whether the property to be covered is pre-FIRM or post-FIRM.  
2. Determine the appropriate zone.  
3. Determine occupancy: single fam ily, two- to four-family, other residential, nonresidential, or 
manufactured home. 
4. Determine building type, including the number of floors. 
5. Determine whether building has a basement (or enclosed area below an elevated building): none, 
finished, or unfinished. 
6. Determine elevation difference. 
7. Calculate premium using the appropriate rates. 
8. Apply appropriate deductible if an optiona l deductible is chosen. Note that the increased cost of 
compliance (ICC)  premium is not subject to deductible factors. 
9. Add the ICC amount to the premium. 
10. Apply community rating system (CRS) credit if applicable. 
11. Add a 15 percent reserve fund assessment fee. 
12. Add $50 probation surcharge  if structure is located in a community on probation. 
13. Add HFIAA surcharge and the federal policy fee.  
Special Rating Situations 
Special rating situations include circumstances that involve tentative rates, alternative rates, or 
grandfathering. 
Tentative Rates 
Insurers use tentative rates  to issue policies when th e insurance agent fails to  provide the necessary rating 
information. Tentative rates are typically higher than  the NFIP published rates. When tentative rates are 
used, a declarations page and a tentative rate lette r will be forwarded to the policyholder, agent, and 
mortgagee (if any) requesting the necessary informati on so that the proper rate can be ascertained.  
Tentatively rated policies cannot be endorsed to in crease policy limits or renewe d for another policy term 
until the insurer has received the necessary actuarial rating informa tion and full premium payment.  
If a loss occurs on a tentatively rated property, the lo ss payment is limited by the amount of coverage that 
the initially submitted premium would have purchased using the correct actuarial rating information. 
Alternative Rates 
When a structure is pre-FIRM and the FIRM zone is unknown, an alternative rating  process can be used 
for noncoastal high-hazard areas. In these cases, the NF IP will assume that the building is located in an 
SFHA.   
19 The NFIP also uses the alternative rating procedur e for renewing policies in communities that have 
converted from the emergency program to the regul ar program during a policy’s term. When initially 
using alternative rates, the agent should determin e the actual FIRM zone as soon as possible during the 
initial policy term and submit a gene ral change endorsement to correct the FIRM zone and premium. 
Unless the correct flood zone is provided, the policy cannot be renewed.  
Grandfathering  
Grandfathering  is a situation in which an old rule continues to apply. With flood insurance, grandfathered 
property that had lower rates under some previous situ ation continues to qualify for lower rates even after 
the situation changes. 
A community’s flood risk potential can change for many different reasons. For example:  
 One community might install structural impr ovements (dams, levees, etc.) to decrease the 
potential effects of flooding.  
 Another community might engage in new commer cial or residential development that could 
aggravate the flooding situation.  
 Communities sometimes revise their geographical boundaries, resulting in the designation of 
additional or reduced flood hazard areas.  
When situations like these occur, the FIRM is re vised and republished. When this happens, flood 
insurance premiums can dramatica lly increase for policyholders who se property is reclassified. The 
NFIP’s grandfather rules give the insured the opt ion of using the new and updated rating criteria or 
having the premium rate determined  using the BFE and/or flood zone on the FIRM in effect when the 
building was originally constructed or wh en flood insurance was first procured.  
Effect of Biggert-Waters  
In order to ensure that flood insurance rates more accurately reflect the risk, Biggert-Waters presumably 
phased out subsidized rates for non-primary (sec ondary) residences such as a vacation home occupied 
only during the summer months. Subsidized rates for ot her property classes were also to be eliminated 
over time, beginning in late 2013. 
These subsidies were to be phased out by imposing a 25  percent premium increase every year until rates 
increase the true risk. These changes would affect the following property owners.12 
 Owners of non-primary (secondary) residences in an SFHA  
 Owners of business properties in an SFHA  
 Owners of property that has experienced severe or repeated losses 
The owners of primary  residences located in SFHAs would retain  their subsidized rates unless or until 
one of the following conditions occurs. 
 The property is sold. 
 The policy lapses. 
 The property suffers severe repeated flood losses. 
 A new policy is purchased. 
Grandfathered rates were to be phased out for mo st properties whenever a community adopts a new 
FIRM. The phase-out would happen gradually over a 5- year period, with a 20 percent rate increase each 
year.13  
 
20 Effect of the Homeowner Flood Insuranc e Affordability Act (HFIAA) of 2014  
It probably could have been predicted that ma ny policyholders strenuously objected to increased flood 
insurance premiums, and they let their congr essional representatives know. In March 2014, Congress 
reduced some of the rate increases that had alr eady been implemented and prevented some future 
increases. Among other things, the 2014 law requires pr emium increases for most subsidized properties of 
at least 5 percent annually until the premium reache s its full-risk rate. However, it prevents most 
policyholders from experiencing annual rate increases of more than 18 percent.  
The 2014 law also reinstated grandfathering, with th e effect that properties recategorized as being at a 
higher risk of flooding under FEMA’s revised maps woul d not be subject to large increases. In addition, 
the 2014 law terminated a Biggert-Waters provisi on that removed a subsidy once a home was sold. 
According to FEMA, more than 80 percent of NFIP  policyholders were not affected by either Biggert-
Waters or the later rollback. The properties most affect ed were located in high-risk flood zones, were pre-
FIRM properties, or were second homes. 
The 2014 law also instituted an HFIAA surcharge fo r all policyholders of $25 on primary residence and 
$250 on all other policies.

1. A. The official map of a community  on which FEMA has delineated spec ial hazard areas and risk premium 
zones is known as a flood insurance rate map, or FIRM. 
2. C. Ben’s building is post-FIRM because it was substantia lly improved after the eff ective date of an initial 
FIRM. 
3. A. Base flood, while often referred to as a 100-year flood, actually refers to a flood having a 1 percent or 
greater probability of occurring in any given year. 
4. A. Because this part of Blake’s house is below ground level on all sides, it qualifies as a basement. 
5. A. A community in the emergency program does not yet have a FIRM, so no FIRM date is available. 
 
   
23 Chapter 3 
General Rules 
Overview 
 
Many of the complicated rules in the frequently revised Flood Insurance Manual  may raise questions. 
This chapter examines some of the general rules a nd procedures but does not cover every rule or nuances 
of the rules.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 describe various rules and procedures associated with handling NFIP applications and policies 
and 
 identify, define, and use key techni cal terms associated with the NFIP. 
Standard NFIP Forms 
Each of the following three NFIP forms is referred to as a standard flood insurance policy (SFIP). 
 Dwelling form 
 General property form 
 RCBAP  
Despite their somewhat misleading titles, scheduled building policies  and preferred risk policies (PRPs) , 
discussed later this chapter, are not additional, different coverage forms.  A policyholder who has a 
scheduled building policy or a PRP has coverage unde r one of the three standard insurance policies 
(forms) mentioned above.  
 
 
 
24 Eligibility  
Exhibit 3.1 describes each SFIP form and the types of risks each form may be used to insure. 
One significant distinction between these forms invol ves the valuation provisions that apply to building 
coverage. The dwelling form and the RCBAP provide replacement cost  coverage, while the general 
property form provides actual cash coverage on th e building. All forms provide ACV coverage on 
contents. 
Exhibit 3.1  
Flood Form Description and Eligibility

percent of its total floor area in 
residential use 
 Detached garage 
 Toolshed 
Stock, inventory, or ot her commercial contents 
Residential 
Condominium Building 
Association Policy (RCBAP) Issued to residential 
condominium association 
on behalf of association and unit owners In the regular program only, the RCBAP 
provides building coverage such as the common 
elements of the condominiums and, if requested, coverage for commonly owned 
contents for a residential condominium building 
with 75 percent or more of its total floor area used for residential purposes. In addition, it 
covers the structural items of the condominium 
units inside the building. The RCBAP is not 
designed to cover the individual contents of each unit owner. 
  
 
26 Structures at separate locations need separate NFIP  policies, with one exception, referred to as a 
scheduled building policy . 
Scheduled Building Policy 
As many as 10 buildings can be covered under a single sch eduled building policy if all buildings have the 
same ownership and the properties on which the insure d buildings are located are contiguous. Blanket 
limits are not available; separate limits of insurance apply to each  covered property. 
Preferred Risk Policy (PRP)  
A PRP is available for properties located in Zones B, C, X, AR, or A99 in a regular program NFIP 
community that meet certain loss history requirements. A PRP is an SFIP (dwelling, general, or RCBAP) 
with lower rates. 
SFIP insurance buyers who insure their building and it s contents outside the PRP program normally select 
a dollar limit of coverage on the building and a dolla r limit of coverage on their contents. The PRP, 
however, provides fixed combined building/contents limits, such as $200,000/$80,000 ($200,000 on the building and $80,000 on the contents).  
The PRP makes combined building/contents limits of  up to $250,000/$100,000 available for owners of 
residential properties and up to $500,000/$500,000 fo r nonresidential properties. Contents-only coverage 
is available for tenants and owners of  all eligible occupancies, except wh en the contents are all located in 
a basement. Multi-unit residential condominium buildi ngs eligible for coverage under an RCBAP are not 
eligible for the PRP. 
Only one building can be insured by each PRP po licy, and only one policy can be written on each 
building. To be eligible, a building must be located within a B, C, X, A99, or AR flood zone on the 
current effective FIRM and must meet certain loss-history requirements.  
General Application Procedures 
The NFIP flood insurance application form, or a simila r form for WYO insurers, must be used to apply 
for all flood insurance policies except a PRP, which uses a shorter application form. A separate 
application must be submitted for each structure for which building and/or contents insurance is being 
requested.  
Applications for coverage on properties that were cons tructed in the most hazardous zones after the date 
of issuance of the initial flood map for the community must include an elevation certificate  showing the 
elevation of the building’s lowest floor.  
NFIP community participation rules require the prep aration of elevation certificates for all buildings 
constructed in the community’s SFHAs after the initial FIRM date. Elevation certificates for these 
properties should be readily available from the building or permits department of the community’s city or 
county government office. If a certificate was not pr epared as required at the time the building was 
constructed, the property owner must arrange to ha ve a certificate prepared by a qualified surveyor or 
engineer.  
The NFIP community number and the flood zone a pplicable to the property must be shown on the 
application. An up-to-date Community Status Book, showing the names, number, and FIRM dates of all 
participating communities is available on FEMA’s webs ite. Also, the permits or building department of 
the community’s city or county government office s hould be able to provide this information.  
The applicable flood zone can also be determined from a review of the flood map for the community. 
Flood maps can be obtained from the community’s city or county government office or by contacting the 
NFIP. Many WYO insurers offer free zone determinat ion services. Agents whose flood insurance policies  
27 are issued directly by the NFIP can contact th e NFIP servicing office for assistance with zone 
determination. 
The correct annual premium for the amount of coverage  being requested must be submitted along with the 
application. (Biggert-Waters14 allows for the premium to be paid in installments.) 
If the premium submitted with the application is inade quate due to a rating or calculation error, but the 
application is otherwise in order, the policy will be  issued with the maximum coverage limits that the 
premium submitted will purchase. The insured will then be  notified of the amount of additional premium 
required to purchase the requested limits, and if the NF IP receives the additional premium within 30 days, 
the policy limits will be amended to pr ovide the originally requested limits  of coverage, effective as of the 
policy inception date.15 
The flood insurance application collects information su ch as the type of property, occupancy, description 
of the building, and the use, as well as information a bout risk factors affecting the building, occupancy 
information, and elevation data relative to the ground level.  
After all parts of the application are complete, the ag ent should attach all require d certifications and other 
documents to the applicant’s check, draft, or money order, payable to the insurer for the required amount. 
A credit card payment is also acceptable if the in sured signs a disclaimer form stipulating that 
cancellation of the policy in matters involving a billin g dispute is allowable only for a billing error or 
fraud. The original copy of the application and relate d documents with the total prepaid amount is mailed 
to the insurer. Copies of the application should be di stributed to the agency file, the applicant, and the 
mortgagee. A copy of the application and a copy of  the premium payment will satisfy the mortgagee’s 
proof-of-purchase requirements.  
After the insurer receives the application and premium,  it will process the application and issue the policy. 
The policy contract and declarations page will then  be mailed to the agent and the mortgagee(s).  
If the application is incomplete or contains incorrect  data, the application will not be processed but will be 
placed into a pending file until the agent provides the missing or correct data. For NFIP direct business, if 
the missing information is not provided, the policy wi ll be issued with tentative rates. If insufficient 
information is available to tentatively rate the polic y, the flood insurance application will be rejected and 
the premium payment return ed to the applicant. 
Waiting Period/Effective Date of Policy 
Flood coverage can be purchased at any time, but it usually does not provide immediate coverage on the 
date of its purchase.  
Flood insurance does not cover a loss in progress . To avoid the adverse selection that would result if 
coverage was purchased in anticipation of an imminent flood, a waiting period applies.  
There is a standard 30-day waiting period  from the time a policy is purch ased until coverage applies. The 
effective date of a new policy will be 12:01 a.m. local  time on the 30th calendar day after the application 
date and the presentment of premium.  
Coverage will not begin until the waiting period h as passed, so the NFIP does not recognize or accept 
binders. This means that the agent normally has no authority to make flood insurance effective 
immediately. However, there are a few exceptions to that rule. 
    
 
28 Exceptions 
Key exceptions to the 30-day wa iting period include the following. 
 There is no waiting period for an existing flood in surance policy in which an additional amount of 
coverage is required with making, increasing, extending, or renewing a loan, such as a second 
mortgage, home equity loan, or refinancing. C overage is effective immediately, as long as the 
premium payment is made at or prior to the loan closing. 
 There is no waiting period when flood insurance is  mandated as a result of a lender determining 
that a loan that does not have flood insurance shoul d have this coverage (e.g., property in a high-
risk area). The insurance is eff ective immediately, as long as the pr emium payment is made at the 
completion of a loan application. 
 There is a 1-day waiting period when an additiona l amount of insurance is required due to a map 
revision. This rule applies when the map revi sion results in a non-SFHA becoming an SFHA and 
only if the application for increased coverage is received within 13 months following the map 
revision. The increased amount of coverage w ill be available 24 hours after the amount of 
coverage is applied for and th e additional premium is made. 
Statutory Coverage Limits 
The maximum flood insurance limits available from the NFIP are based on the type of program 
(emergency or regular), whether the property is resi dential or nonresidential, the size of the residential 
property (e.g., one-family dwelling as compared to a five-family dwelling), and the jurisdiction, as shown 
in Exhibits 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. 
Exhibit 3.2 
Building Coverage—Lower 48 States 
Building Coverage—All Lower 48 States   Regular Program Emergency Program 
Single or 2–4 family dwelling $250,000 $35,000 
Other residential* $250,000 $100,000 
Nonresidential or commercial $500,000 $100,000 
*Biggert-Waters16 provides that multifamily residential propertie s of five or more residences may purchase flood 
insurance up to the limits for commercial properties.

and US Virgin Islands   Regular Program   Emergency Program   
Single or 2–4 family dwelling $250,000 $50,000 
Other residential* $250,000 $150,000 
Nonresidential or commercial $500,000 $150,000 
*Biggert-Waters17 provides that multifamily residential propertie s of five or more residences may purchase flood 
insurance up to the limits for commercial properties.

Contents Coverage—All Jurisdictions 
Contents Coverage—All States   Regular Program Emergency Program 
Residential $100,000 $10,000 
Nonresidential or commercial $500,000 $100,000 
 
For a flood insurance policy on condominium propert y owned by a residential condominium building 
association, distinct maximum limits apply. The ma ximum amount of building coverage that can be 
procured on a condominium is the replacement cost va lue of the building or the total number of units in 
the condominium building multiplied by  $250,000, whichever is less. The maximum allowable contents 
coverage is the ACV of the commonly owned conten ts up to a maximum of $100,000 per building.  
Residential condominium unit owners who want flood c overage on the contents of their units must to 
purchase their own dwelling policies. 
Deductibles 
When a loss occurs under the flood policy, the amount pa yable by the insurer is subject to a standard 
deductible shown on the policy’s declarations page. Deductibles apply separately to buildings coverage 
and contents coverage. Therefore, an insured with flood damage to both buildin g and contents will have 
two deductibles. No deductible appli es to coverage for (a) expenses in curred to protect personal property 
against flooding, (b) condominium loss assessments, or (c) ICC.  
Biggert-Waters18 provides for minimum annual deductibles for s ubsidized and nonsubsidized properties:  
 Subsidized (pre-FIRM) properties: $1,500 for st ructures insured for $100, 000 or less and $2,000 
for structures insured for higher amounts. 
 Nonsubsidized (post-FIRM) prope rties: $1,000 for structures insured for $100,000 or less and 
$1,250 for structures insured for higher amounts. 
Higher deductibles of up to $10,000 are available for one- to four-family dwelli ngs, and deductibles up to 
$50,000 are available for other residential and nonres idential property. Deductibles can be increased at 
any time during the policy term by submitting a co mpleted general change  endorsement form. 
Deductibles cannot be reduced mid-term unless require d by the mortgagee and written authorization is 
provided by the mortgagee. A 30-day waiting period w ill be applied to reducing the deductible, unless the 
request is in connection with making, increasing, extending, or renewing a loan.  
The form’s deductible provision specifies that the de ductible for buildings under construction that do not 
have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss will be twice the deductible that would otherwise apply.  
Cancellation 
The insured may cancel the policy at any time. Howeve r, return premiums in connection with midterm 
cancellations are payable only when the reason for the cancellation is one of those established in the NFIP 
Flood Insurance Manual  as qualifying for a return premium. The insured may be entitled to no refund, a 
pro rata refund, or a full refund. Some situa tions involve a time limit or other restrictions. 
The restrictions on payment of return premiums in  connection with midterm cancellations are necessary 
because of the seasonal nature of flooding. Without these restrictions, it would be possible to purchase 
coverage at the beginning of the flood season and can cel the policy a few months later once the threat of 
flooding has passed.  
 
30 The Flood Insurance Manual  lists cancellation reason codes that are to be used when completing an NFIP 
cancellation/nullification request form and indicates the type of refund for which each type of cancellation 
qualifies. These codes are shown in Exhibit 3.5.

Miscellaneous Rules 
Miscellaneous rules include policy term and assignment. 
Policy Term 
The only policy term available is 1 year for both NFIP direct business flood policies and policies issued 
through WYO insurers.  
Assignment 
Once the transfer of title occurs, a property owner’s  flood insurance building policy may be assigned in 
writing to a purchaser of the insured property without  the written consent of the NFIP. Most other types 
of insurance permit assignment only with the consent of  the insurer and, as a practical matter, the seller’s 
policy is usually canceled and replaced with a ne w policy purchased by the buyer. Exercising the NFIP 
approach to assignment eliminates waiting-period issu es that might otherwise be involved when property 
is sold. 
Policies on buildings in the course of constructi on and policies insuring contents only may not be 
assigned. A new application is warranted in these circumstances.

34 Chapter 4 
Covered Property and Additional Coverages 
Overview 
 
This chapter offers an overview of the covered prope rty and additional coverage provided under the NFIP 
dwelling form, the most commonly used NFIP form.  
Most of the main characteristics of an NFIP dwelling form also apply to the general property form and the 
RCBAP. The chapter notes some situations in which these other policies differ from the dwelling form. 
For example, the dwelling form and the RCBAP provide  replacement cost coverage, while the general 
property form provides actual cash coverage on th e building. All forms provide ACV coverage on 
contents. 
The chapter addresses the coverage on building proper ty (Coverage A), personal property (Coverage B), 
other coverages (Coverage C), and ICC (Coverage D). Unlike standard Insurance Services Office, Inc., 
homeowners or dwelling policies, the NFIP provi des no additional living expense coverage. This 
discussion also describes the types of property  not covered under the NFIP dwelling form.  
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify the types of property that can and ca nnot be covered under a standard NFIP policy and 
 identify, define, and use key technical terms associ ated with the coverage of a standard NFIP 
policy. 
 
35 Building Property (Coverage A) 
A flood insurance policy can cover the building, the cont ents, or both. Which coverages apply is indicated 
in the declarations. 
In the dwelling form that includes building coverage, covera ge on building property (Coverage A) applies 
to the dwelling  described on the policy declarations page . (The general property form’s Coverage A 
applies to the building  described, and the RCBAP’s Coverage A applies to the residential condominium 
building  described.) Covered building property includes add itions and extensions attached to the building 
by a common wall, a stairway, a walkway, or a roof. An  attached garage or other appurtenant structure 
falls into this category. 
Manufactured homes and travel trailers that are attach ed to a permanent foundation can also be insured as 
building property. However, manufactured homes and travel  trailers that are located in an SFHA must be 
anchored in a way that complies with specific policy provisions for coverage to apply.  
Buildings under construction or unde rgoing alteration or repair can also qualify as covered property. 
Restrictions, however, apply to coverage on structures that are not yet walled or roofed. Such structures 
are covered only while work is in progress and for up to 90 days after work is halted. Unwalled or 
unroofed structures in specified zones have no covera ge until the building is walled and roofed if the 
lowest floor is below the base flood elevation (BFE).  
The following fixtures, machinery, and equipment are covered as building property. 
 Awnings and canopies 
 Blinds 
 Built-in dishwashers and microwave ovens 
 Carpet permanently installed over unfinished flooring 
 Central air conditioners 
 Elevator equipment 
 Fire sprinkler systems 
 Walk-in freezers 
 Furnaces and radiators 
 Garbage disposals 
 Water heaters, including solar water heaters 
 Light fixtures 
 Outdoor antennas attached to buildings 
 Permanently installed cabinets, cupboards, book cases, paneling, wallpaper, and wall mirrors  
 Plumbing apparatus 
 Pumps and their operating machinery 
 Refrigerators, ranges, and ovens 
Coverage applies only at the location described on the d eclarations page or at another location (for up to 
45 days) if the property is moved to protect it from the imminent danger of flood. For coverage to apply, 
the removed property must then be placed in a fully enclosed building “or otherwise reasonably protected 
from the elements.” Furthermore, the removed propert y must be placed above ground level or outside an 
SFHA.  
 
36 Personal Property (Coverage B) 
Personal property  is everything that is subject to ownership, other than real estate. Personal property for a 
home owner includes not only what is usually cont ained in a home, such as a television, a washing 
machine, and clothing, but also items stored in the garage such as a lawn mower. Personal property for a 
business includes furniture, inventory, office supplies,  and other business personal property. Property 
permanently attached to the foundation or the ground , or property such as wall-to-wall carpeting or a 
central air conditioner, would be considered real pr operty. A key test to determine whether property is 
personal property might be whether a person would reasonably take the item along when he or she moves. 
If so, it would be considered personal property. 
When a flood policy covers a building’s contents, th e personal property covera ge (Coverage B) applies 
only to personal property that is inside the fully encl osed building at the location described in the policy. 
Coverage is provided for propert y owned by the named insured or household family members. The 
dwelling form also covers, at the insured’s option, property owned by guests or servants.  
Improvements and Betterments 
If the insured is a tenant, improvements to the build ing made or acquired at the insured’s expense are 
covered under the personal property c overage. However, this coverage is subject to a maximum of 10 
percent of the personal property coverage limit.  
If the insured is a condominium unit owner (not an associ ation), up to 10 percent of the personal property 
coverage limit can be applied to cover losses to interior walls, floors,  and ceilings that are not covered 
under a flood policy issued to the condominium association.  
Items Specifically Covered as Contents 
To clarify whether building coverage or contents c overage applies to certain items, the policy explicitly 
states that the following items are covere d under the personal property coverage. 
 Air-conditioning units—portable or window units  
 Carpets not permanently installed, over unfinished flooring  
 Carpets over finished flooring  
 Clothes washers and dryers  
 Food freezers (other than walk-in freezers) and frozen food  
 Ovens and cookout grills  
 Portable dishwashers and microwave ovens  
 Outdoor equipment and furniture stored inside the insured building (RCBAP and general property 
form only) 
Items Subject to Limitations 
Coverage on a few types of personal property is subject to a maximum of $2,500 per occurrence. 
 Artwork, photographs, collectibles, and memorabilia  
 Furs and articles containing fur  
 Jewelry, watches, precious or semiprecious stones, and articles made of precious metals  
 Personal property used in a business (not app licable to the RCBAP and general property form) 
 Rare books   
37 Antiques are covered only for their functional value. 
Coverage on personal property applies at the location described on the declarations page or at a temporary 
location (for up to 45 days) if the property is moved to  protect it from the imminent danger of flood. For 
coverage to apply, the removed pr operty must be placed in a fully  enclosed building “or otherwise 
reasonably protected from the elements.” Furtherm ore, the removed property must be placed above 
ground level or outside of an SFHA. 
Limitations on Property in Basements or Enclosures 
Only certain specific types of proper ty located in a basement or enclos ure are covered, and coverage is 
severely limited, and Exhibit 4.1 shows the applicab le language, which is located in the “Property 
Covered” section of the form (Section III).

Excluded Property 
Several types of property are not covered under the NFIP dwelling form. Exhibit 4.2 provides a summary 
of the “Property Not Covered” section of the dwe lling form. Likewise, none of these excluded items is 
covered under the RCBAP and ge neral property forms.   
 
40 Exhibit 4.2 
Summary of Excluded Property 
 Personal property not inside the fully enclosed building  
 Buildings and contents located over water or seaward of mean high tide, if the building was 
constructed after September 30, 1982  
 Open structures, including boathouses 
 Personal property located in, on, or over water  
 Recreational vehicles, other than travel trailers that qualify as building property  
 Self-propelled vehicles (except those not licensed for road use, or designed and used to 
assist handicapped individuals, w hen located inside a building)  
 Land, lawns, trees, plants, growing crops, and animals  
 Accounts, bills, and evidences of debt  
 Money and securities, bullion, stored value cards, and postage stamps  
 Manuscripts and valuable papers  
 Underground structures and equipment, including wells and septic systems  
 Walks, decks, driveways, patios, and other su rfaces located outside the perimeter, exterior 
walls of the building or the building in which the insured unit is located  
 Tanks containing gases or liquids and simila r containers, including related equipment  
 Buildings and contents in which more than 49 percent of the ACV of the building is below

 Personal property a condominium unit owner owns in common with other unit owners who 
belong to a condominium association 
Other Coverages (Coverage C) 
In addition to building and personal property coverage, the NFIP po licy provides several other coverages, 
including the following. 
 Debris removal expenses 
 Expenses of removing property to safety  
 Sandbagging expenses  
 Condominium loss assessments (dwelling form only) 
 Pollution damage (general property form only)  
41 Debris Removal Expenses 
Debris removal expenses are covered, subject to the limits that apply to the building and its contents. 
There is no debris removal sublimit. If the insured performs the debris rem oval, the insured’s labor is also 
covered; it will be valued at the federal minimum wage. 
The debris removal coverage in SFIP forms is not limited to the cost of removal of debris of the insured’s 
covered property. It also pays for the removal of  a neighbor’s debris on the insured’s property. In 
addition, coverage for the cost of removal of de bris of the insured’s own covered property applies 
regardless of where the debris has landed.  
Expenses of Removing Property to Safety 
If it is necessary to move covered pe rsonal property to protect it from flood damage, not only is coverage 
extended to apply at the location to which the propert y is removed (for up to 45 days), but coverage is 
also provided for the reasonable expenses, up to $1,000, incurred in moving the property. Covered 
expenses specifically include the value of the insure d’s own labor, determined at the prevailing federal 
minimum wage. The $1,000 limit on remova l expenses is part of, rather than in addition to, the limits of 
insurance on building and personal property, and it is not subject to the policy deductible.  
Sandbagging Expenses 
If the insured’s property is clearly threatened by floo d, the form provides up to $1,000 of coverage for 
sandbags (including sand, plastic sh eeting, and lumber used in connec tion with them), fill for temporary 
levees, pumps, and wood purchased by the insured to save the covered building from the imminent danger 
of flooding. In order for coverage to apply, a legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or 
a similar type of civil order for the insured’s neighborhood, calling for measures to preserve life and 
property. The value of the insured’s or a family me mber’s own labor at the federal minimum wage is 
included. The $1,000 limit on sandbags, s upplies, and labor is part of, rath er than in addition to, the limits 
of insurance on building and personal property. This coverage is not subject to the policy deductible. 
Condominium Loss Assessments 
If the policy covers a condominium unit, any condominium loss assessment s are insured, subject to the 
limits that apply to the building. (A unit owner who purchases no coverage on building property would 
not have any flood loss assessment coverage.) 
This coverage applies to loss asses sments resulting from the direct physical loss by or from flood to the 
building’s common elements occurring during the po licy term charged to the insured’s unit by the 
condominium association, in accordance with the c ondominium association’s articles of association, 
declarations, and the insured’s deed. This coverage  does not increase the dwelling limit. This additional 
coverage does not apply to the RCBA P or general property forms.  
Pollution Damage 
The general property form also pays up to $10,000 fo r damage caused by pollutants to covered property if 
the discharge or seepage of the pollutants is caused by or  is the result of flooding. This coverage does not 
include the cost of testing for, or the monitoring of, pollutants unless required by law. This $10,000 limit 
is part of, rather than in addition to, the limits of  insurance on the building and personal property. This 
additional coverage does not appear in the RCBAP or dwelling forms.  
  
 
42 Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) (Coverage D) 
This coverage is roughly comparable to the ordina nce or law coverage in other types of property 
insurance policies. The policy provides up to $30,000 of coverage for “increased cost of compliance.” 
This coverage pays for increased costs resulting from the enforcement of floodplain management 
ordinances or laws that require elevation, flood-proof ing, relocation, or demolition of a structure after 
direct loss by flood. 
Coverage applies only when either of  the following circumstances applies. 
 The cost to repair a flood-damaged structure equa ls or exceeds 50 percent of its market value and 
the state or community is enforcing a substantia l damage provision in its  floodplain management 
law  
 The structure qualifies as a repetitive loss structure  because it has suffered two flood losses 
(including the current loss) paid by the NFIP pr ogram during a 10-year period, the cost of each 
repair equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the mark et value of the structure, and the state or 
community is enforcing a cumulative substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in 
its floodplain management law. 
No ICC coverage applies to garages or carports, pr operty located in communities participating in the 
emergency program, structures insured under a group flood insurance policy, or condominium association 
assessments. 
The $30,000 limit cannot be increased. It applies in addition to the building limit shown on the 
declarations page, unless the sum of the two limits  exceeds the maximum limit permitted under the Act 
(the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968). This  coverage is not subject to a deductible. 
No Time Element Coverage 
One of the many controversial issues surrounding the NFIP  is its lack of coverage for additional living 
expenses, loss of income, or other time element losses. Biggert-Waters19 requires the US Government 
Accountability Office to conduct a study on the impact of expanding the flood program to include these 
important coverages. Private flood insu rance policies often offer these options. 
Disclosures 
Biggert-Waters20 includes a requirement that every NFIP polic y “shall state all conditions, exclusions, and 
other limitations pertaining to coverage … in plain E nglish, in boldface type, and in a font that is twice 
the size of the text in the body of the policy.” Any person who fails to comply with this provision is 
subject to a fine of up to $50,000.  
This might have sounded good in theory. In practice,  however, a large portion of the policy’s provisions 
qualify as conditions, exclusions, and limitations. The policy was reforma tted in October 2015 to comply 
with this requirement, resulting in a policy that is  cluttered and difficult to read, with headings and 
subheadings that are in a smaller font than much of the text.  
43 Chapter 4 Review Questions 
1. Kendrick's one-story house is insured under an  NFIP dwelling policy that provides building 
coverage but not personal prope rty coverage. An enclosed br eezeway connects the house with 
Kendrick's two-car garage. Because the garage is at a slightly lower elevation than the house, 
flood waters damage the garage but do not r each the house. Kendrick's standard NFIP flood 
insurance policy 
A. covers Kendrick's garage under Coverage A (building property) because it is an attached 
appurtenant structure. 
B. covers Kendrick's garage under Cove rage B (appurtenant structures). 
C. does not cover Kendrick's garage because he did not purchase personal property 
coverage. 
D. does not cover Kendrick's garage unless it is separately described in the policy.

program, or to structures insured under a group flood insurance policy. 
    
 
46 Chapter 5 
Covered Peril and Other Provisions 
Overview 
 
Chapter 5 continues the coverage analysis, but with  a different focus. An NFIP SFIP is essentially a 
single-peril policy, covering losses proximately caused only by flood. This chap ter begins by reviewing 
the definition of flood. It continues with an overvie w of key exclusions found in the policy and concludes 
with a brief discussion of important conditions and provisions such as the valuation and coinsurance 
provisions.  
This chapter focuses on the dwelling form but menti ons some areas in which there is a significant 
difference between the NFIP dwelli ng form and other NFIP forms. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 identify events that do or do not fall within an NFIP policy’s definition of “flood” and 
 describe the exclusions found in a standard NFIP policy.  
Definition of Flood 
Coverage is provided only for “direct physical loss by or from flood,” as evidenced by physical changes 
to the property. The definition of “flood” is shown in Exhibit 5.1. 
 
47 Exhibit 5.1 
NFIP Policy Definition of Flood 
Flood,  as used in this flood insurance policy , means: 
1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of 
normally dry land area or of two or more proper ties (one of which is your property) from:  
a. Overflow of inland or tidal waters;  b. Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;  
c. Mudflow.  
2. Collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result 
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated 
cyclical levels that result in a flood  as defined in A.1.a.  above.  
Source: NFIP Standard Flood Insurance Policy—Dwelling Form.  
 
For coverage to apply, the flood must be a general condition that covers two or more acres of normally 
dry land area or two or more properties, one of wh ich is the insured’s property. If floodwaters are 
confined to the insured’s prope rty, there may be no coverage. 
By exception to an exclusion, coverage also appli es to loss resulting from sewer  backup, sump discharges 
or overflows, and seepage of water, if a flood in the area is the proximate cause.  
Mudflow 
The SFIP’s definition of “flood” explicitly encompasses a mudflow , which is defined as “a river of liquid 
and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of 
water. Other earth movements, such as landslide, slope failure, or a saturated soil mass moving by 
liquidity down a slope, are not mudflows.” 
Mudflows can develop when water saturates the gr ound, such as from rapid snowmelt or heavy or long 
periods of rainfall, causing a thick liquid downhill flow  of earth. Mudflows are different from other earth 
movements, such as landslides, slope failures, and ev en moving saturated soil masses in which masses of 
earth, rock, or debris move down a slope where there is not a flowing characteristic.  
Exclusions 
No coverage is provided for loss of use of, or access to , the covered property, lo ss of revenue or profits, 
loss from interruption of business or production, or any other economic loss. Also not covered is any 
increase in the cost of repair or rebuilding that is th e result of ordinances regulat ing construction or repair 
of buildings, other than as provided in the $30,000 I CC coverage. Furthermore, no coverage is provided 
for loss caused directly by earth movement (i.e ., earthquake, landslide, land subsidence, sinkholes, 
destabilization of land that results from the accumula tion of water in subsurf ace land area, or gradual 
erosion) even if the earth movement is caused by flood.  
There is a distinction between mudflows  and mudslides . A flood policy may cover mudslide damage as 
long as the mud is carried by a river or stream of wa ter. So, if a dam breaks and picks up a hillside and 
carries it into the insured home, coverage might appl y. But a flood policy will not cover damage if a 
hillside becomes saturated as a result of rainfall and slowly begins to move. That’s considered earth 
movement. 
 
  
 
48 There are a few other noteworthy exclusions: 
 Loss caused by the insured’s modification to the insured property that materially increases the 
risk of flooding 
 Loss from water, moisture, mildew, mold, or  mudslide resulting primarily from a condition 
substantially confined to the dwelling or from a condition that is within the insured’s control  
 Loss that is already in progress as of 12:01 a.m. of  the policy inception date, or, with respect to an 
increase in limits, the date when the additional coverage becomes effective 
Key Conditions and Provisions 
Important conditions and provisions  include the reduction and reform ation of coverage provision, 
concealment or fraud and policy voidance provision, c onditions suspending or restricting insurance, and 
loss settlement valuation a nd coinsurance clauses.  
Reduction and Reformation of Coverage 
The “General Conditions” section of the polic y includes an important provision titled “ Reduction and 
Reformation of Coverage .” This provision establishes conditio ns under which the policy will be 
considered to provide lower limits of insurance than those shown in the declarations. When the amount of 
premium the insurer receives is not enough to purch ase the limits requested, the policy will provide only 
the limits that can be purchased with the amount of pr emium received. For example, if the insured applied 
for $250,000 in property limits but the premium s ubmitted was only enough to pa y for $220,000 in annual 
coverage, only $220,000 in lim its would be provided.  
On discovering the insufficiency, the insurer must  advise the insured in writing of the amount of 
additional premium due. If the insurer receives that am ount within 30 days of th e date of the insurer’s 
written notice of the premium due, the policy will be re formed back to the incep tion date to provide the 
originally requested limits—even if  the insufficient premium is only discovered at the time of loss. 
Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance 
Another important provision in the “General Cond itions” section of the policy, titled “Concealment or 
Fraud and Policy Voidance,” establishes the conditions under which the policy will be considered void.  
 If the property shown on the application is not e ligible for coverage, the policy is void from its 
inception.  
 If the community in which the property is locat ed was not participating in the NFIP on the 
inception date and did not become a participati ng community during the policy term and prior to 
any loss, the policy is also void from its inception.  
 In the event any insured or its agent has inten tionally concealed or misrepresented any material 
fact or circumstance, engaged in fraudulent conduct, or made fals e statements in connection with 
the policy, the policy is void as of the date of the wrongful act. 
Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance 
This section of the policy also includes an “inc rease in hazard” type provision. The “Conditions 
Suspending or Restricting Insurance” provision stipulat es that the insurer is not liable for loss occurring 
while there is a hazard that is increased by any means that is within the insure d’s control or knowledge. 
For example, if the insured altered the landscape and dr ainage configuration of his or her property in a 
way that increased the chances of a flood loss, no fl ood coverage applies due to this provision.   
49 Loss Settlement Valuation and Coinsurance for Dwelling Form and RCBAP Form 
The dwelling form and the RCBAP offer the following three methods of settling losses, each of which is 
used for a different type of property. 
 Replacement cost 
 Special loss settlement 
 ACV 
Replacement Cost 
Under the dwelling form, replacement cost  valuation applies to a single-family dwelling if it is the 
principal residence of the insured for at least 80 perc ent of the (a) 365 days immediately prior to the loss 
or (b) the period of ownership, if this period is less than 365 days.  
In addition, the limit of insurance applicable must  be 80 percent or more of the building’s full 
replacement cost or the maximum limit allowabl e under the plan. The maximum amount of NFIP 
coverage available is often much lower th an the building’s full replacement value. 
When these conditions are met, the insurer agrees to pay or replace the damaged dwelling after applying 
the deductible and without deduction for depr eciation but not to pay more than the least of the following 
amounts. 
 Building limit on the declarations page  
 Cost of replacing the damaged part of the dwe lling, with materials of like kind and quality 
 Necessary amount actually spent to repair or repl ace the damaged part of the dwelling for like use 
Essentially the same provisions apply to any e ligible property insured under the RCBAP form.  
For example, John Smith owns a single-family home w ith a replacement cost value of $500,000. John 
purchases a standard NFIP dwelling policy with a lim it of $250,000. John’s home is badly damaged in a 
flood, and John spends $100,000 to  repair the damage. John will recover $100,000. His home is not 
insured to 80 percent of its replacement value,  but John carries the maximum amount of insurance 
available under the NFIP. 
Special Loss Settlement 
In the dwelling form, the special loss settlement provi sion applies to a single-family dwelling that is a 
manufactured or mobile home or is a travel trailer.  The home must be at least 16 feet wide when fully 
assembled and contain at least 600 square feet. It s hould also be the insured’s principal residence. 
For a total loss, the insurer pays the least of the following amounts. 
 Replacement cost of the dwelling  
 1.5 times the ACV of the dwelling  
 Building limit shown on the declarations page  
For a partial loss, if the insurer determines that it is economically feasible to repair the dwelling to its pre-
damage condition, the loss will be settled by applyi ng the replacement cost provisions mentioned above. 
Under the RCBAP, a comparable loss provision applies to a residential condominium building that is (1) 
a manufactured home or travel trailer or (2) at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and contains at least 600 square feet.   
 
50 Actual Cash Value (ACV)  
ACV is the cost to replace the covered property at the time of the loss, less any applicable physical 
depreciation.  
This loss settlement applies to a si ngle-family dwelling not subject to replacement cost or the special loss 
settlement valuations as well as th e following types of property. 
 Personal property  
 Appliances and carpets  
 Outdoor equipment, such as awnings and aerials of any type  
 Detached garages  
 Two-, three-, or four-family dwellings  
 Units that are not used exclusivel y for single-family dwelling purposes  
 Abandoned property on the described location 
 Dwellings that are not the insured’s principal residence  
When the limit of insurance on the dwelling is both less than 80 percent of its full replacement cost prior 
to the loss and less than the maximum limit ava ilable under the plan, the insurer will pay the greater  of 
the following amounts, but no more than the limit on the dwelling. 
 ACV of the damaged part of dwelling 
 A proportion of the cost to repair or repl ace the damaged portion, without deduction for 
depreciation and after applying the deductible 
Example 
For example, Bill Jones owns an ol der single-family home with a repl acement cost value of $500,000 and 
purchases a standard NFIP dwelling policy with a lim it of $200,000. Bill’s home is badly damaged in a 
flood, and he spends $100,000 to repair the damage . The ACV of the damaged portion of the structure 
was $70,000 at the time of the loss. John will recove r $80,000. His home was not insured to at least 80 
percent of its $500,000 replacement value, a nd Bill did not carry the $250,000 maximum amount of 
insurance available on a dwelling building under th e NFIP. The $200,000 limit on his insurance policy 
was 80 percent of the amount he sh ould have carried, and he will r eceive 80 percent of the amount he 
spent on repairs—in this case, $80,000. 
Under the RCBAP, the ACV provision applies to comp arable property such as personal property, but it 
also pertains to a manufactured home or a travel tra iler (eligible under the RCBAP ) that does not meet the 
conditions for the special loss settlement.  
The RCBAP ACV provision pays the le ast of the following amounts. 
 Applicable limits of insurance under the flood insurance policy 
 ACV of loss 
 Amount required to repair or replace the property wi th material of like kind and quality within a 
reasonable period of time after the loss occurs  
  
51 Loss Settlement Valuation for the General Property Form 
This form has a single loss settlement provision. The policy will pay the least  of the following amounts 
after applying the deductible. 
 Applicable limit of insurance under the flood insurance policy 
 ACV 
 Amount it would cost to repair or replace the pr operty with material of like kind and quality 
within a reasonable period of time after the loss occurs 
Coinsurance Penalty in the RCBAP 
The RCBAP includes a coinsurance pena lty that applies only to the bu ilding coverage. The coinsurance 
penalty applies at the time of a loss if the insured has not purchased insurance with a limit at least equal to 
the amount required by one of the following criteria: 
 80 percent or more of the full replacement cost  of the building at the time of loss or  
 the maximum amount of insurance under the NFIP. 
The amount of insurance “required” in the RCBAP is similar to the coinsurance “requirement” in other 
types of property policies with one important exception:  No coinsurance penalty is imposed if the insured 
has purchased the maximum amount of coverage available under the NFIP. 
When a coinsurance penalty appli es, the insured’s recovery will be  determined by using the following 
formula.  
Insurance Carried 
× Amount of Loss = Limit of Recovery 
Insurance Required 
 
Where the penalty applies, building loss under the RCBA P will be adjusted based on the replacement cost 
coverage with a coinsurance penalty. The cost of br inging the building into compliance with local codes 
(law and ordinance) is not included in the calculation of replacement cost.  
 
52 Chapter 5 Review Questions 
1. Some insurance policies cover loss to covered pr operty from virtually any cause while others are 
more limited in scope. A standard NFIP flood insurance policy is 
A. A multi-peril policy that covers fl oods, mudflow, and earth movement 
B. A single-peril policy that covers only the flood peril 
C. An all risks policy that includes flood and other perils 
D. An endorsement that converts a standard  homeowners policy to a multi-peril policy 
2. A small area in Watershed, USA, has flooded due to heavy rains. Watershed is a participant in the 
regular program with the NFIP. A resident wants to know if he is going to have coverage under 
his flood policy for the water damage to his home and contents. He will, so long as one of two 
criteria is met. They are: 
A. A legally authorized FEMA official issu es an evacuation order, or the flood causes 
damage to the insured's home. 
B. A legally authorized FEMA official issues an evacuation order, or the flood covers two or 
more acres of normally dry land area. 
C. The flood covers three or more acres of norma lly dry land area, or a legally authorized 
FEMA official issues an evacuation order. 
D. The flood covers two or more acres of normally  dry land area or two or more properties, 
one of which must be the insured's property 
3. Which one of the following does an NFIP flood insurance policy cover? 
A. Loss that is already in progress as of 12:01 a.m. of the policy inception date 
B. Loss caused by the insured's modification to  the insured property that materially 
increases the risk of flooding 
C. Loss from water, moisture, mildew, mold , or mudslide resulting primarily from a 
condition substantially confined to the dwe lling or from a condition that is within the 
insured's control 
D. Loss caused by an inland body of water that  exceeds its banks due to heavy snowmelt 
4. NFIP representative Bob tells client Richard, who has applied for a flood policy, that he is 
eligible because his community is a participant in the regular flood program. Richard has given 
Bob all the required information, including the fl ood hazard zone where his property is located. 
Bob tells Richard that on the first page of the fo rm is a statement specifying that the insurance is 
based on the insurer's reliance on the accuracy of  the information that Richard has provided. 
What will happen if it is later determined th at Richard knowingly gave Bob the wrong flood 
hazard zone? 
A. Nothing; the policy is still in effect. 
B. Richard will be given a refund on the difference in premium based on the different flood 
hazard zone. 
C. The policy will automatically be ame nded with the correct information. 
D. The policy will be void  
53 5. The Indiana Condominium Association could purch ase up to $500,000 in flood insurance from 
the NFIP. However, the association believes its building, which has an insurable value of $1 
million, is not likely to sustain major damage if a flood occurs, so the association purchases an 
RCBAP with a $300,000 limit. If pa rtial damage to the association building should occur, 
A. it will be paid in full up to $400,000. 
B. the insurer will pay 60 percent of the loss 
C. the insurer will pay 75 percent of the loss. 
D. the insurer will pay 80 percent of the loss.  
 
54 Answers to Chapter 5 Review Questions 
1. B. An NFIP policy is a single-peril policy th at covers losses proximately caused by only one 
peril: flood. 
2. D. For coverage to apply, the flood must be a ge neral condition that covers two or more acres of 
normally dry land area or two or more properti es (one of which is the insured’s property). 
3. D. Overflow of an inland water body qualifies as a flood that would, in most cases, be covered. 
However, some flood losses are excluded because of their timing or lack of fortuity. 
4. D. The policy is void as of the date of the wrongful  act in the event any insured or its agent has 
intentionally concealed or misrepresented any ma terial fact or circumstance. Since the flood 
hazard zone classification affects policy rating— and Bob apparently hope d his lie would reduce 
his premium—the information would probably be considered material. 
5. B. The amount of insurance “required” to avoid a coinsurance penalty in this case is the smaller 
of either (a) 80 percent of its $1 million insura ble value (which is $800,000) or (b) the maximum 
amount of insurance available, which is $500,0 00. The association carried $300,000 in coverage 
and should have carried $500,000, so a coinsuran ce penalty applies and it will recover 3/5 or 60 
percent of any covered loss. 
      
55 Chapter 6 
Flood Insurance Legislation 
Overview 
 
Chapter 6 examines the factors that  led to the introduction of the NFIP and describes the most recent 
developments, Biggert-Waters and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which 
rescinded some provisions of Biggert-Waters. The ch apter also examines some of the more significant 
milestones along the way, notably the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (1982) and the National Flood 
Insurance Reform Act (NFIRA) of 1994. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 summarize the purpose and effect of key legislativ e developments in the evolution of the NFIP. 
NFIP Background 
The traditional view is that flooding fails to qualify as  a commercially insurable risk for at least three 
reasons: 
 Adverse selection : Only individuals who ow n property in flood-prone areas are likely to purchase 
flood coverage. 
 Unaffordable premiums for insurance buyers : Premiums based on the actual level of risk would 
be too costly for the typical household. 
 Inadequate premiums for insurers : Private insurers probably coul d not generate premiums high 
enough to insure against a catastrophic flood that  would simultaneously affect many insureds. 
In the absence of private flood insurance, the fede ral government responded by instituting loss control 
measures. Dams, levees, and other structures desi gned to restrain flood waters may actually have 
encouraged people to build in flood zones.  
Faced with increasing amounts of flood damage and th e high costs of disaster relief, Congress passed the 
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, which created the NFIP. 
 
 
56 The NFIP had three components: 
 Floodplain management 
 Flood hazard mapping 
 Flood insurance 
The NFIP made federal flood insurance available in communities that adopt floodplain management 
regulations that meet NFIP standards. The creation of  maps to identify flood-prone areas is an important 
part of this program. 
The NFIP was revised in 1969 to provide coverage for mudslides.21 
The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973  restricted the use of federal funds in high-risk floodplains and 
prohibited federally regulated, supervised, or in sured lenders from lending money on property in a 
floodplain in a participating community that did not have flood insurance. These measures were expected 
to ensure that most properties in these zones ha d flood insurance, but the law making insurance 
mandatory was poorly enforced. Legislation enacted  in 1994 tightened the enforcement of these flood 
insurance requirements and denied federal disaster aid to people who had been flooded twice and failed to 
purchase insurance after their first flood. 
Coastal Barrier Resources Act 
The US Congress passed the Coastal Barrier Resources Act in 1982  to address concerns caused by 
coastal barrier development. Coastal barriers  shield the mainland from the full force of wind, wave, and 
tidal energies. 
This law restricts federal expenditures and financial assistance, including flood in surance, in the Coastal 
Barrier Resource System, a defined list of undevel oped coastal barriers mapped along the Atlantic and 
Gulf of Mexico coasts.  
Three important goals of this Act are to 
 reduce the loss of human life by discourag ing development in high-risk areas;  
 decrease wasteful spending of federal resources; and 
 conserve natural resources associated with coastal barriers.  
Flood insurance may not be available for property located  in coastal barriers or otherwise protected areas. 
Property owners are generally made aware of the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) designation 
affecting their property when they obtain a mortgage that requires flood insurance. However, there is no 
federal mandate for the disclosure of a CBRS designation by  state and/or local officials or realtors at the 
time of purchase or construction.  
National Flood Insurance R eform Act (NFIRA) of 1994 
The NFIRA established the community rating system (CRS) explained in Chapter 1, which encourages 
communities to surpass the minimum requirement s for development within flood plains.  
Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 
Repetitive flooding of flood-prone properties, which c ontinued to have an adverse impact on the NFIP, 
led to the June, 2004 passage of the Bunning-Bereut er-Blumenauer Flood Insura nce Reform Act of 2004. 
This Act was designed to create a 5-year pilot progr am to “reduce losses to properties for which repetitive 
flood insurance claim payments have been made.”   
57 Purposes of the Act 
The overall purposes of this Act included the following. 
 To assist people experiencing serious and repetitiv e flood damage to solve their problems with 
financial assistance from NFIP in part nership with communities and states 
 To stop or mitigate the abuse of the program causing all policyholders  to pay higher flood 
insurance premiums 
 To advance consumer understanding and th e rights of flood insurance policyholders 
 To establish minimum flood insurance training and education requirements for insurance agents 
and brokers 
In particular, the act authorized FEMA to provide financial assistance to participating communities and 
states to carry out mitigation activities or to purchase “ severe repetitive loss properties .” Policyholders 
who refuse a mitigation or purchase offer that meet s program requirements will be required to pay 
increased premium rates of 150 percent following their refusal and another 150 percent following future 
claims of more than $1,500. These rates, however, ca nnot exceed the applicable actuarially determined 
rate.  
Flood Insurance Claims Handbook 
The Act directed FEMA to develop the Flood Insurance Claims Handbook22 that provides policyholders 
with information on pursuing a claim. The handbook, di scussed further in Chapter 7, explains what to do 
before a flood and what to do after a flood. 
Acknowledgement Form 
The Act also directed the FEMA director to develo p an acknowledgement form. By signing, dating, and 
returning this document to the insu rer, the policyholder acknowledges that 
 he or she has received a declarations page a nd a summary of coverage from the insurer,  
 the insurer has provided information on the property’s loss history and a copy of the NFIP Flood 
Insurance Claims Handbook , and 
 the insured understands that he or she has an  option to purchase both building and contents 
coverage as part of his or her policy or to purch ase building and/or contents coverage separately. 
Supplemental Form  
The Act also required the director to develop and prov ide insurers and agents with supplemental forms to 
be given to all new and renewal policyholders. These fo rms included the following. 
 The exact coverages a policyholder is purchasing 
 Any exclusions that apply to  the coverages being purchased 
 An explanation, accompanied by illustrations, of how lost and damaged items will be valued 
(e.g., ACV or replacement cost) 
 The number and dollar value of flood claims filed dur ing the life of the property and the effect of 
filing any further claims. 
FEMA currently provides a number of different info rmative consumer-oriented brochures that can be 
ordered or downloaded from its website at www.fema.gov  or viewed online at www.floodsmart.gov .   
 
58 Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 
2012 
The NFIP was intended to be a self-sustaining progr am that borrowed from the US Treasury during times 
of above-average claims and subse quently repaid the borrowed money, with interest. However, the NFIP 
is deeply in debt and currently ow es the US Treasury billions of dollars  that have been borrowed to pay 
for past losses. Over a recent 4-year period, the NF IP was extended 17 times and even expired four times. 
After each expiration, it has been retroactively rein stated. These successive interruptions, combined with 
a variety of proposed reforms, led to the passage of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and 
Modernization Act of 2012. 
Biggert-Waters directed FEMA to submit a plan to re pay its debt within 10 years and submit periodic 
reports on its progress, and it required FEMA to build up a reserve fund in a separate account that would 
enable the NFIP to meet its future obligations. The reserve fund was to cover at least 1 percent of the 
NFIP’s total claim exposure. 
The Act was also designed to implement actuarially based flood insurance rates for at-risk structures. 
Until now, pre-FIRM structures were entitled to subsid ized premiums, and affect ed policyholders paid 
substantially less for their flood insurance. A significa nt portion of NFIP claims have been paid under 
these subsidized policies. Biggert-Waters phased in prem ium increases that move from subsidized rates to 
actuarially sound rates. This was to be done in several ways: 
 Premiums on new policies on properties not cu rrently covered by flood insurance would be 
charged full actuarial rates. 
 Owners of second homes, business properties, sever e repetitive loss properties, or substantially 
improved/damaged properties that currently be nefitted from subsidies would see their rates 
increase by 25 percent per year until premiums met the full actuarial cost. 
 When an area not previously designated as an SFHA was reclassified as an SFHA, due to a flood 
map upgrade, the increased premium that resulted wa s to be phased in over a 5-year period at a 
rate of 20 percent per year. 
This meant that most pre-FIRM subsidized rates and grandfathered rates would be phased out over the 
course of the next 5 years. However, the owners of primary  residences located in SFHAs would retain 
their subsidized rates unless or until one  of the following conditions occurred. 
 The property was sold. 
 The policy lapsed. 
 The property suffered severe repeated flood losses. 
 A new policy was purchased. 
These changes substantially increased the cost of flood insurance for many policyholders, leading to a 
chorus of policyholder complaints.  
Biggert-Waters also introduced many other wide-ra nging changes. These included making higher limits 
of flood insurance available on multi-family propert ies, introducing minimum deductibles, increasing the 
penalties for lenders that failed to  require flood coverage where required, and establishing a Technical 
Mapping Advisory Council to ensure that FEMA adopted meaningful standards for updating and 
maintaining flood maps. 
 
 
  
59 Biggert-Waters also required a number of studies dealing with a wide-ranging variety of topics such as: 
 The possibility of including business interrupti on and/or additional living expenses coverage 
 The private reinsurance market’s capacity to assume a portion of the NFIP’s risks 
 Methods of increasing both par ticipation and affordability 
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affo rdability Act of 2014 (HFIAA) 
Biggert-Waters attempted to make the NFIP actuarially  sound by charging rates that accurately reflected 
each insured property’s true flood risk. This meant, of course, that many polic yholders would be paying 
more for their flood insurance. The most controvers ial changes dramatically reduced the discount, or 
subsidy, that benefited older properties in high-risk  areas. Rates for businesses, secondary residences such 
as vacation homes, and structures with severe repeated losses were to receive rate increases of 25 percent 
per year until their rates reached an actuarially sound level. Other subsidized policyholders could retain 
their subsidies until the policy lapsed or the pr operty was sold, but anybody purchasing a previously 
subsidized home would have to pay nonsubsidized rates, which were ge nerally much higher. This made it 
nearly impossible for many people to sell their homes.  
HFIAA provided refunds to some policyholders, lowered the recent rate increases affecting some policies, 
prevented some future rate increases, and introduced a surcharge on all policyholders. However, it did not 
change all of Biggert-Waters. 
Refunds were made to policyholders in high-risk ar eas who had been required to pay the full-risk rate 
after purchasing a new flood policy on or after July  6, 2012. Some policyholders who renewed their 
policies after HFIAA was enacted and whose premium increased by more than 18 percent were also 
entitled to a refund. However, no refunds were ma de to owners of second homes, business properties, 
severe repetitive loss properties, or substantially im proved/damaged properties th at previously benefited 
from subsidies and saw their rates increase by 25 percent per year. 
HFIAA provided that subsidized policies will now receive gradual rate increases rather than the 
immediate rate increases called for in some cases by Biggert-Waters. Premiums for most subsidized 
properties are to increase by at least 5 percent each ye ar until the premium for th e class reaches its full-
risk rate.  
With limited exceptions, flood insurance premiums cannot increase by more than 18 percent per year. 
However, new policies for the following properties will continue to see 25 percent annual increase until 
they reach their full-risk rate: 
 Older business properties insured with subsidized rates 
 Older secondary residences insu red with subsidized rates 
 Severe repetitive loss properties insured with subsidized rates 
 Buildings that have been subs tantially damaged or improved  
Until FEMA develops further guidelines, purchasers of  Pre-FIRM property are permitted to assume the 
previous owner’s flood insurance policy and pay the same rates.  
HFIAA also introduced surcharges intended to offset the continuing subsidies and make the flood 
program more financially sound. Policies on primary residences will include a $25 surcharge, and all 
other policies will include a $250 surcharge. 
When flood maps are updated, property owners sometim es find that their property is now in a higher risk 
flood zone. Previously, these properties continued to  pay lower rates, but Biggert-Waters required 20 
percent annual rate increases until the property reach ed full-risk rates. HFIAA provides that homes and 
businesses that are remapped into a higher risk area do not receive an immediate rate increase. However, 60 rate increases will in crease between 5 and 15 percent a nnually, and no property is to receive more than an 
18 percent increase. 
To further improve afford ability, the new law also rai ses maximum residential dedu ctible limits from 
$5,000 to $1 0,000. 
HFIAA also requires FEMA to conduct an affordability study. Wit h an ey e toward  affordability, the Act 
also encourag es FEMA to minimize the number of polici es in which flood premiums exceed 1 percent of 
the coverage amount. This wo uld be the case, for ex ample, if a home owner would be charged more than 
$2000 per year for $200,000 o f flood in surance coverage. 
More Recent Developments 
To date, federal proposals to use more actuarially s ound rates for the NFIP h ave had on ly limited success. 
Howev er, in March 2019 the Trump administration announ ced plans to reform the NFIP with a shift to 
fully risk-based pricing  of flood insu rance. FEMA’s current system calculates rates based on whether a 
home falls in a desig nated flood zo ne. According  to FEMA, the reformed pro gram would begi n to assess 
properties in dividually, using sev eral v ariables such  as hurricane rainfall, coastal surges, and proximity  to 
bodies of water,  rather than applying a single formula fo r an entire floo d zone. FEMA plans to  implement 
the new system on October 1, 2021.

64 Chapter 7 
Responsibilities 
Overview 
 
Flood insurance policyholders and the agents who sell the insurance all have certain responsibilities. 
Chapter 7 outlines these responsibilities, with empha sis on the processes involved in handling flood 
claims. The chapter also identifies various resources th at an agent will find helpful in obtaining further 
information. 
Chapter Objectives 
On completion of this chapter, you should be able to 
 describe the respective responsibiliti es of NFIP policyholders and agents in handling flood claims 
and 
 recognize important resources that assist an agen t in understanding and ha ndling flood insurance. 
Insured’s Responsibilities 
FEMA’s Flood Insurance Claims Handbook23 is designed to help insureds with the claims process. It 
includes three key sections: 
 What to do before a flood 
 What to do after a flood 
 Appealing the claim 
What To Do before a Flood 
Any flood insurance policyholder should do four thin gs long before he or she faces a flood claim: 
 Check the declarations page of his or her policy for accuracy.  
 Prepare and maintain a current detailed invent ory of personal property within the home or 
business, documented by photos or videos. 
 
65  Keep originals of important papers—including in surance policies—in a safe, waterproof place.  
 Contact his or her insurance agent or insure r representative and discuss the requirements for 
reporting a flood claim. Remember, it might be difficult to contact these people after a flood. 
 Share an emergency contact name  and phone number with his or he r insurance agent and family. 
It might be difficult for them to contact the insured after a flood. 
What To Do after a Flood 
Steps to take after a flood loss occurs include the following. 
 Contact the insurance agent or insurer re presentative promptly to report the claim. 
 File a notice of loss with the insurer. 
 Separate the damaged fro m the undamaged property. 
 Make a detailed list of damaged personal property. 
 List areas of structural damage for the adjuster. 
Handling the Claim  
If the insured makes a claim, he or she must work with the insurance ad juster before, during, and after the 
adjuster assesses the loss. Th e adjuster will use his or her understandi ng of the damage, together with any 
documentation provided by the insured, to complete  a detailed estimate that serves as a guide when 
obtaining bids from contractors. 
The insured must support the claim with a proof of loss, together with supporting documentation, 
completed and signed within 60 days of the loss. The adjuster usually provides a suggested proof of loss, 
but it is the insured’s responsibility to make sure it is complete, accurate, a nd timely. If the flood is 
severe, FEMA might authorize proof of loss extensi ons beyond 60 days, but it  is still the insured’s 
responsibility to meet the 60-day or extended deadline. 
A claim is payable after the insured and the insure r agree on the damage amount payment and the insurer 
receives a complete, accurate, signed proof of loss.  The claim payment includes the names of anyone, 
such as a mortgagee or lienholder, who h as a legal interest in the property. 
An insured who later notices additional damage to covered property may file a request for additional 
flood payment, following FEMA procedures. 
If the insured home or business sustains damage that  the local community determines is equal to or 
greater than 50 percent of the property’s value, th e insured may file an increased cost of compliance 
(ICC) claim. A standard flood policy includes ICC coverage for up to $30,000. 
Appeals Process 
The NFIP Flood Insurance Claims Handbook  outlines the process to be followed by any insured who is 
dissatisfied with a flood claim settlement. Before  pursuing the appeals process, FEMA encourages 
policyholders to talk with the adjuster to determine whether relevant information has been overlooked or 
any mistakes were made. A policyholder who is still not satisfied has three options: 
 File an appeal within 60 days of the denial. 
 Utilize the policy’s appraisal provision if there is disagreement concerning the amount of the 
covered loss.  
 
66  As a last resort, a claimant may sue the insure r. The policy includes a “suit against us” provision, 
which specifies that the claimant must first have  complied with all the policy’s requirements, and 
the suit must be started within 1 year of the insurer’s written claims denial. 
Agency Responsibility 
When writing flood insurance, an insuran ce agent or producer has three options: 
 place all business with one or more WYO companies; 
 place all flood insurance directly with the NFIP ( NFIP Direct business); or 
 place business both with the NFIP directly and with one or more WYO companies. 
The agent’s claims handling responsibilities vary de pending on the channel through which a policy was 
written. In handling a WYO claim, the agent or producer should follow the WYO company’s established 
procedures. WYO insurers that insure both th e flood and the wind loss will assign their own single 
adjuster to a wind-and-flood claim. 
NFIP Direct claims are normally assigned to  an NFIP-approved independent adjuster.

water surface elevation resulting from a flo od that h as a 1 p ercent ch ance of equaling or exceeding that 
level in any given  year.  
basement: Any  area of the buildin g, including any su nken room o r sunken portio n of a room, having its 
floor below gr ound level (subgrade) on all sides.  
BFE: See base flood elevation. 
Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012  (Biggert-Waters): Signed into law on July  6, 
2012, this act reauthorizes the Natio nal Flood  Insuran ce Prog ram (NFIP) for 5 years through September

Claims Coordina ting Office (CCO): A clearinghouse for the various insurers that are respond ing to a 
multiperil catastrophe. Through  voluntary participatio n, all losses are reported to the CCO and are 
processed to locate address matches among the reported cl aims. The in terest of each insurer is protected 
as the claims coordinator maintains sole control over the policy and lo ss information. If a match is found, 
special care is taken to  direct the assig ned adjuster(s) to a mutu ally agreeable adjustment or to have one 
adjuster surrender his/her lo ss with the assurance that every effort will be made to replace it.

cover residential buildings of five fam ilies or more and nonresidential buildings. 
   
 
72 grandfathering:  An exemption based on circumstances prev iously existing. Under the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP), buildings located in  emergency program communities and pre–flood 
insurance rate map (FIRM) buildings in  the regular program are eligible for subsidized flood insurance 
rates . Post-FIRM buildings in the regular program bui lt in compliance with the floodplain management 
regulations in effect at the start of construction will continue to have favorable rate treatment even though 
higher base flood elevations (BFEs) or more restrictive,  greater risk zone designations result from FIRM 
revisions.  
ICC: See increased cost of compliance. 
increased cost of compliance (ICC):  Coverage for expenses a propert y owner must incur, above and 
beyond the cost to repair the physical damage the st ructure actually sustained from a flooding event, to 
comply with mitigation requirements of state or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. 
Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, flood-pr oofing, relocation, demolit ion, or any combination 
thereof.  
loss in progress: A loss that is already in progress as of 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the policy term or, 
as to any requested increase in coverage limits, a lo ss that is already in progress when the additional 
coverage is requested. 
lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including a basement). An unfinished or 
flood-resistant enclosure, usable sole ly for parking of vehicles, buildi ng access, or storage in an area other 
than a basement area, is not consider ed a building’s lowest floor if such enclosure is not built so as to 
render the structure in violation of requirements.  
mandatory purchase:  Under the provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act (FDPA) of 1973, 
individuals, businesses, and others bu ying, building, or improving property located in identified areas of 
special flood hazards within participating comm unities are required to purchase flood insurance as a 
prerequisite for receiving any type of  direct or indirect federal financ ial assistance (e.g., any loan, grant, 
guaranty, insurance, payment, subsidy, or disaster assistance) when the building or personal property is 
the subject of or security for such assistance.  
manufactured (mobile) home:  A structure built on a permanent chassis,  transported to its site in one or 
more sections, and affixed to a permanent founda tion. “Manufactured (mobile) home” does not include 
recreational vehicles.  
mobile home:  See manufactured home. 
mudflow:  A river of liquid and flowing mud on the surf aces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is 
carried by a current of water. Other earth movements,  such as landslide, slope failure, or a saturated soil 
mass moving by liquidity down a slope, are not mudflows. 
National Flood Insurance Act (1968): Legislation that created the National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP). 
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  A federal program enabling property owners in 
participating communities to purchase insurance protec tion against losses from flooding. This insurance is 
designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster  assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing 
damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.  
National Flood Insurance Reform Act (NFIRA) of 1994:  The purpose of NFIRA was to improve the 
financial condition of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and reduce federal expenditures for 
disaster assistance to flood-damaged properties. The act affected every part of NFIP, insurance, mapping, 
and floodplain management. NFIRA also gave lenders tools with which to enforce requirements for flood 
insurance coverage mandated under the Flood Di saster Protection Act (FDPA) of 1973.  
NFIP: See National Flood Insurance Program.  
73 NFIP Direct: Flood insurance that the agent or producer places directly with the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP), as opposed to insurance placed through a Write-Your-Own (WYO) company. 
NFIP participating companies:  Private insurers that write flood insurance under the Write-Your-Own 
Program, also known as WYOs. 
nonresidential:  Includes, but is not limited to, small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings 
(including grain bins and silos), pool houses, cl ubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, 
agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, hot els and motels with normal room rentals for less 
than 6 months’ duration, and nursing homes.

being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
other residential:  Hotels and motels where the normal occupa ncy of a guest is 6 months or more; a 
tourist home or rooming house that has more than f our roomers. A residential building (excluding hotels 
and motels with normal room rentals for less than 6 m onths’ duration) containing more than four dwelling 
units. Incidental occupancies such as office, professional private school, or studio occupancy, are 
permitted if the total area of such incidental occupanc ies is limited to less than 25 percent of the total 
floor area within the building.  
participating community:  A community for which Federal Emer gency Management Agency (FEMA) 
has authorized the sale of flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  
post-FIRM building:  A building for which construction or s ubstantial improvement occurred after 
December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective da te of an initial flood insurance rate map (FIRM), 
whichever is later.  
pre-FIRM building:  A building for which construction or subs tantial improvement occurred on or before 
December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of an initial flood insurance rate map (FIRM).  
preferred risk policy (PRP):  A policy that offers fixed combinati ons of building/contents coverage or 
contents-only coverage at modest, fixed premiums. The PRP has been av ailable for property located in B, 
C, and X zones in regular program communities that meet eligibility requirements based on the property’s 
flood loss history, but it will be phased out over a 5-year period beginni ng in October 2013.  
private flood insurance: Insurance issued by an insu rance company authorized to do business in the state 
where the insurance building is located that provides flood insurance at least as broad as a National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP) policy. Section 100239 of  Biggert-Waters defines more specifically what 
qualifies as private flood insurance. 
probation surcharge (premium):  A flat charge that the policyholder must pay on each new or renewal 
policy issued covering property in a community that  the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has 
placed on probation due to violations or deficienci es in the administration and enforcement of NFIP 
floodplain management regulations. 
RCBAP: See residential condominium building association policy. 
reduction and reformation of coverage:  A standard flood insurance policy (SFIP) provision that 
establishes conditions under which the policy will be cons idered to provide lower limits of insurance than 
those shown in the declarations because the amount of  insurance submitted with the application was not 
enough to support the requested limits. 
regular program:  The final phase of a community’s partic ipation in the National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP). In this phase, a flood insurance rate map is in effect and full limits of coverage are 
available under the Act.

Insurance Program (NFIP)-insured structure if it has suffered at least two flood losses (including the 
current loss) paid by the NFIP program during a 10-y ear period, the cost of each repair equaled or 
exceeded 25 percent of the structure’s market value, and the state or community is enforcing a cumulative 
substantial damage provision or re petitive loss provision in its floodplain management law. See also 
severe repetitive loss property. 
replacement cost value (RCV):  The cost to replace property with the same kind of material and 
construction without deduction for depreciation.

Reserve Fund as authorized by the Biggert-Wa ters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. 
residential condominium building association policy (RCBAP):  Policy issued to insure a residential 
condominium building and all units within the building if the building is located in a regular program 
community and at least 75 percent of the total floor area is residential. 
river flooding:  Flooding that is normally seasonal because of snowmelt or heavy rains. Water fills the 
river basin too quickly, and the river flows over its  banks. Water then covers the floodplain, often 
damaging homes, and other property.  
scheduled building policy:  A policy that requires a specific amount of insurance to be designated for 
each building and its contents. A scheduled building policy may cover two to te n buildings owned by the 
same owner and located at the same location (on cont iguous properties). Standard flood insurance policy 
(SFIP) forms are used. 
severe repetitive loss property:  For single-family properties, cons isting of one to four residences, 
property covered under a flood insurance policy that has incurred flood insurance damage 
 for which 4 or more separate claims payments have been made under the flood insurance policy, 
with the amount of each such claim more than $5,000 and with the cumulative amount of such 
claims payments totaling more than $20,000; or 
 for which at least 2 separate claims payments have been made under such coverage, with the 
cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the property’s value. 
For multiple family properties, the term has “such  meaning as the [Federal Emergency Management 
Agency] Director shall by regulation provide.”  
See also repetitive loss structure.
